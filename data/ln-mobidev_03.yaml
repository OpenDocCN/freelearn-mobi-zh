    world with the iPhone, offering well-designed apps of their own and curating apps
    that were accepted into the App Store. Thanks to Apple's higher standards for

    The default iOS Xcode settings don't permit you to create a dynamic library, but
    that can be worked around by copying over the MacOS settings. However, while this
    can be tested out locally, roadblocks appear during code signing, and the kernel

    be loaded, extracted, and invoked. This is because the Dalvik VM permits some
    levels of custom class loading from alternate locations such as local storage
    or a remote network. However, this is not suitable for all apps and has a fair
    bit of complexity when it comes to properly dealing with all scenarios.
