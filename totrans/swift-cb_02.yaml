    of the Swift language. In this chapter, we will build on this knowledge to create
    more complex structures, such as arrays and dictionaries, before moving on and
    looking at some of the little gems Swift offers, such as tuples and typealias.
    Finally, we'll round off this chapter by looking at extensions and access control
    – both of which are key components that contribute to a sound yet efficient codebase.

- en: A tuple is declared as a comma-separated list of the types it contains, within
    brackets. In the preceding code, you can see a tuple being declared as `(Int,
    String)`. The function, `normalizedStarRating`, normalizes the rating and creates
    `numberOfStars` as the closest round number of stars and `ratingString` as a display
    string. These values are then combined into a tuple by putting them, separated
    by a comma, within brackets; that is, `(numberOfStars, ratingString)`. This tuple
    value is then returned by the function.

    `DeviceModel` enum and the `AppleiPhone` and `AppleStore` classes are all declared
    as `public`. This has the benefit of making them available outside the module
    but preventing them from being subclassed or modified. Given how Apple protects
    the look and feel of their phones and stores, this seems correct for this model.
