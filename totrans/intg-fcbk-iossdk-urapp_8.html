<p id="e-gf35">Creating a good application is not enough to succeed in the social platform world. It is also important to promote our application using different channels.</p>
<p id="e-YEMB">We should define our application's goal by identifying the types of users we want to reach, and working out the promotional plan.</p>
<h1 id="e-Vc6D">Getting to know your users</h1>
<p id="e-hEWC">The Facebook Platform provides a data analysis tool to understand the type of users and how they use it.</p>
<p id="e-Y41P">In order to access the <strong>Insights</strong> tool, visit <strong>Facebook App Dashboard</strong> and select our social application.</p>
<img data-width="800" data-height="407" src="img/mz6gwCid.jpg"/><p id="e-MnrM">Click on <strong>Edit Settings</strong> or <strong>Edit App</strong> as shown in the preceding screenshot.</p>
<img data-width="409" data-height="800" src="img/ZfcjD8XI.jpg"/><p id="e-IJIU">Click on <strong>Insights</strong> on the left side bar of the page. The following screenshot shows the <strong>Overview</strong> page of the <strong>Insights</strong> tool:</p>
<img data-width="800" data-height="524" src="img/NWdfORn5.jpg"/><p id="e-FnGQ">The <strong>Overview</strong> page provides information about our active users, as seen in the next screenshot. Using the period filter and the <strong>Export</strong> button, we can export our data to <strong>Excel</strong> or <strong>Comma-separated Values</strong> (<strong>CSV</strong>) file formats.</p>
<img data-width="650" data-height="375" src="img/VudkMKsk.jpg"/><p id="e-Tm93">It is really important to understand how users interact with our application. Based on <strong>Insights</strong>, we can understand which features are more popular among our user pool. This provides useful feedback, so we can focus on improving the less popular features. The following screenshot shows the <strong>Sharing</strong> chart that describes activities on Facebook:</p>
<img data-width="650" data-height="395" src="img/GBCmLjM0.jpg"/><p id="e-qebl">The <strong>Insights</strong> tool provides information that will help you to understand the way your application is engaging users.</p>
<p id="e-tWYu">I strongly recommend going over all the features provided by <strong>Insights</strong> and taking advantage of them while your application is live.</p>

<h1 id="e-ZGVK">Growing your audience</h1>
<p id="e-gZdv">Users are the most important resources for our application. The more users we have, the better. However, it is also important to grow our audience as much as possible.</p>
<p id="e-COKV">We explored some of the following techniques to grow our audience:</p>
<ul id="e-DIeO">
<li id="e-uszj">Posting status updates through the application</li>
<li id="e-X5PA">Inviting Facebook friends to use our application</li>
<li id="e-N2v1">Using Facebook App Center</li>
</ul>
<p id="e-ZOV5">There are other techniques we can use to make our application viral. We should consider all available promotional channels provided by the Facebook Platform.</p>
<ul id="e-W6aJ">
<li id="e-PSwn">
<strong>Canvas Page</strong>: This is a really important window shop for our application. As the application goes up in the ranking, Canvas Page will be visited more. Therefore, we should be careful about all the details listed on the page.</li>
<li id="e-sjJG">
<strong>Suggest to Friends</strong>: This is a straightforward way to share your application with your friends straight from the Facebook web page.</li>
<li id="e-r8c1">
<strong>Open Graph</strong>: This is a protocol to produce engaging stories on the Facebook Platform that gives developers the ability to customize the look and the feel as well as the content to engage users.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="e-RnU9">Mobile ads</h1>
<p id="e-S0gp">Mobile ads are a new feature provided by the Facebook Platform to developers and application administrators to promote their applications on the <strong>Facebook News Feed</strong>. Using the <strong>Ads Manager</strong> tool, we are able to easily create multiplatform ads.</p>
<h3 id="e-cWMh">Note</h3>
<p id="e-vgug"><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/tutorials/mobile-app-ads/">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/tutorials/mobile-app-ads/</a></p>
<p id="e-Xah0">The ability to produce ads that can reach the right users gives us a powerful tool for promoting our mobile social applications.</p>
<p id="e-ZANf">In order to use mobile ads, we need to set up our social application. Open the <code>LBAppDelegate.m</code> file within your social application project. Identify the <code>applicationDIdBecomeActive</code> method. This method is called every time the application starts or resumes. We need to update that method code in order to support mobile ads. The next snippet contains the code that will enable our social application to use mobile ads:</p>
<pre id="e-rqBv">- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application
{
  // Restart any tasks that were paused (or not yet started) while the application was inactive. If the application was previously in the background, optionally refresh the user interface.
  [FBSession.activeSession handleDidBecomeActive];
  [FBAppEvents activateApp];
}</pre>
<p id="e-MAlC">First, we call the <code>FBsession.activeSession handleDidBecomeActive</code> method to resolve the session state for the Facebook's login flow.</p>
<p id="e-VKl4">The  <code>FBAppEvents activateApp</code> method queries the Graph API to determine whether the application has an <code>Install</code> attribution enabled and publishes the ID in order to keep track of successful installations.</p>
<p id="e-wTQv">After the task code is complete, we can move on to create the real mobile ad that will appear on users' <strong>News Feed</strong>. Open <strong>Facebook Dashboard App</strong>, and select our current application and <strong>Edit App</strong>. Be sure <strong>Sandbox Mode</strong> is disabled, and <strong>iPhone App Store ID</strong> is set correctly. We can find our <strong>App Store ID</strong> on the <strong>Apple App Store</strong> using the URL template, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-great-app/APP_STORE_ID">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-great-app/APP_STORE_ID</a>.</p>
<p id="e-msFW">Customize the previous URL using your App Store information.</p>
<img data-width="650" data-height="436" src="img/crANypMi.jpg"/><p id="e-cc6t">On the left side bar, select <strong>App Details</strong>.</p>
<img data-width="410" data-height="752" src="img/lLxKm1F9.jpg"/><p id="e-qgft">In the <strong>App Details</strong> page, be sure all necessary information is provided. We already took care of populating this form in the previous chapter. Ensure that <strong>Display Name</strong> and <strong>Primary Icons</strong> <strong>75x75</strong> are set. I strongly suggest populating as much information as possible to have more information in our mobile ads.</p>
<img data-width="700" data-height="669" src="img/J2d2KaMF.jpg"/><p id="e-dFDV">Now, we can start using Facebook's  <strong>Ads Create</strong> tool.</p>
<h3 id="e-Pd5Y">Note</h3>
<p id="e-Eqfe"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/create">https://www.facebook.com/ads/create</a></p>
<p id="e-fuv7">The following screenshot shows the <strong>Ads Create</strong> tool's landing page:</p>
<img data-width="800" data-height="409" src="img/BqzW4cR3.jpg"/><p id="e-Toct">Within this page, you can advertise anything that exists on the Facebook Platform. In this case, we want to promote our application. Select <strong>iLikeBook</strong> and start creating the mobile ad.</p>
<img data-width="800" data-height="133" src="img/A8vaCwco.jpg"/><p id="e-gLux">In the following screenshot <strong>What would you like to do?</strong>, let us create a new mobile ad using the application information provided in the <strong>App Details</strong> page:</p>
<img data-width="781" data-height="800" src="img/Uc0aWrBp.jpg"/><p id="e-s4Od">In this section, we can choose the type of campaign we want to move forward with. We have three different options:</p>
<ul id="e-kXXj">
<li id="e-tvHV"><strong>Get New Users</strong></li>
<li id="e-rCfX"><strong>Increase App Engagement</strong></li>
<li id="e-WBdB"><strong>See Advanced Options</strong></li>
</ul>
<p id="e-Lk64">For the scope of this book, we are going to create the <strong>Get New Users</strong> campaign. Select the <strong>Get New Users</strong> radio button.</p>
<p id="e-qTNJ">We can now customize the look and feel of our ad through the <strong>Your Ad</strong> section, for example, change title, description, and icon. On the right side of the section, we can have a preview of the ad. These types of ads will appear on the right side bar of <strong>Facebook Desktop App</strong>.</p>
<p id="e-SGhj">The <strong>Sponsored Stories</strong> section provides the ability to developers to create News Feed ads. The <strong>News Feed</strong> campaign is one of the most efficient because people are able to see which application their friends are using.</p>
<p id="e-nbL2">The next step of our campaign is to choose our audience. As best practice, I recommend spreading your audience as much as possible as test cases, slowly narrowing down to determine your audience target. The following screenshot shows the <strong>Audience</strong> section.</p>
<img data-width="800" data-height="595" src="img/qhgOEgMg.jpg"/><p id="e-WXyg">We can customize our campaign based on location, age, and interests of our audience.</p>
<p id="e-I4BU">Using the default option provided by the Platform, we have an audience of almost 160 million people. As we add more precise interests, the audience will decrease. The following screenshot shows the new audience number after defining the precise interest entry:</p>
<img data-width="800" data-height="591" src="img/Di2i0dah.jpg"/><p id="e-ywuw">The new audience is about 14 million people. Once again, for testing purposes, I will strongly recommend you use a broader audience. If you are only trying to increase the number of users for your application with no audience target, just leave the default settings.</p>
<img data-width="800" data-height="299" src="img/Wv88kVMj.jpg"/><p id="e-oJlX">We now need to define the campaign information as follows:</p>
<ul id="e-JQKy">
<li id="e-wahb">Account information</li>
<li id="e-fGqe">Campaign name, schedule, and budget</li>
</ul>
<p id="e-Tbmr">As our next step, we need to review our ad and approve it. Once the mobile ad is approved, we will see our new ad showing up in News Feed and Facebook's right bar.</p>
<p id="e-pDmj">Mobile ads give developers the ability to promote application across the entire Facebook platform, from desktop computer to mobile devices using different ads layouts accordingly.</p>

<h1 id="e-nGef">Summary</h1>
<p id="e-TBC1">In this chapter, we learned how to promote our social application. First, we have to consider our target audience using the <strong>Insights</strong> tool provided by the Facebook Platform. We explored a few techniques in the previous chapter.</p>
<p id="e-peH4">Mobile ads are a good tool to promote our application. We can set ads to target a specific set of people. For good practice, if you are going to set a mobile ad campaign, be sure you start with a large target. As you get to know your audience, slowly narrow down the target.</p>
<p id="e-R2ES">The mobile ads program offers different prices and options for our campaigns. Ultimately, with the largest target size, we can target the entire Facebook community.</p>
