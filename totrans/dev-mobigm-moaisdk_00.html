Moai SDK is a great free and open source solution for this. This book will introduce you to the ways of developing games with Moai SDK using Lua; after reading it, you should be good to go and create the next hit mobile game!</p><p>We hope to see you around soon.</p><p>Welcome to Moai SDK!</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>For this book you’ll need to have either Windows XP (or newer) or Mac OS X.</p><p>You’ll need to download and install Moai SDK and ZeroBrane Studio (refer to <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Installing Moai SDK">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Installing Moai SDK</em>).</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>Moai SDK is a minimalist framework for professional game developers. This means that some of its features may be hard for complete beginners. However, this book aims to help beginners get into Moai SDK. You’ll need some basic understanding on programming (Lua knowledge is not <em>required</em> but extremely recommended) and basic command-line familiarity (in order to run our games).</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text are shown as follows: “We’re creating a method called <code class="literal">Game:start()</code> that will take care of initializing everything and controlling the game loop.”</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">module(“Game”, package.seeall)
GRID_COLS = 5
GRID_ROWS = 4
GRID_TILE_WIDTH = 62
GRID_TILE_HEIGHT = 62
BACK_TILE = 1</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">WORLD_RESOLUTION_X = 320
WORLD_RESOLUTION_Y = 480
<strong>SCREEN_RESOLUTION_X = 2 * WORLD_RESOLUTION_X</strong>
SCREEN_RESOLUTION_Y = 2 * WORLD_RESOLUTION_Y</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: “Open up the ZeroBrane Studio and on the left panel (<strong>Project</strong>), click on the button with the ellipsis (<strong>...</strong>) and head to <code class="literal">moai-sdk/samples/anim/anim-basic</code>, and click on <strong>OK</strong>”.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
