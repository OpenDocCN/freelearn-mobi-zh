    level to reduce the file size. Select **File**, then **Save as**, from the menu
    bar in Preview, and change the quality slider until the image size reduces to
    an acceptable level. Keep in mind, though, that reducing the quality of your images
    too much can cause blocky and pixelated images. Experiment with different quality
    levels until you find an acceptable trade-off. In the following screenshot, you
