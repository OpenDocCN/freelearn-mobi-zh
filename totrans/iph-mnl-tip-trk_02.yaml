- en: In 2020, Apple introduced iOS 14, the latest operating system for the iPhone.
    Besides adding new features, iOS 14 also includeds a **Translate** and a **Magnifier**
    app. The Translate app lets you convert spoken or written words into another language,
    while the **Magnifier** app lets you turn your iPhone camera into a magnifying
    glass to help you read text that may be too small to read comfortably.

    it will be to use your iPhone.

    time, you gradually add apps faster than you remove them. The end result is that
    your Home screen winds up getting cluttered with lots of apps that you don't have
    the time to organize. That's when you can rely on the **App Library** to organize
    apps for you automatically or help you find an app by searching for it by name.
