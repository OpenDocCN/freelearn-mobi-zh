- en: In 2020, Apple introduced iOS 14, the latest operating system for the iPhone.
    Besides adding new features, iOS 14 also includeds a **Translate** and a **Magnifier**
    app. The Translate app lets you convert spoken or written words into another language,
    while the **Magnifier** app lets you turn your iPhone camera into a magnifying
    glass to help you read text that may be too small to read comfortably.

    iOS 14, you can get comfortable with using common user interface elements of iPhone
    apps. Since most apps work in similar ways, the more apps you use, the easier
    it will be to use your iPhone.
