This is a great start, but now it's time to get our hands dirty and start building something. In this chapter we will build upon what was covered in the first one by taking our first steps towards building our very first level.</p></blockquote></div><p>In this chapter we shall:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Learn about the UDK environment and the interface aspects of it that you will need to know</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Build brushes into our world to create an interior space</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Add textures, lighting, and 3D models in that space</li></ul></div><p>So with that, let's get started!</p><div class="section" title="Starting out"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec01"/>Starting out</h1></div></div></div><p>When beginning to use UDK, you may feel frustrated with how complex the editor looks at first glance or how it may not work the way you think it should. In order to help with the transition to these tools, we will ease into the process by looking at the basics of UDK, starting off with the key parts of its interface that you should know the existence of as we create our very first level!<a class="indexterm" id="id59"/>
</p><div class="section" title="A brief walkthrough of the UDK interface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec01"/>A brief walkthrough of the UDK interface</h2></div></div></div><p>Let us start by looking at the UDK interface, which is what you see upon starting the application and closing the welcome menu. While we brushed off learning what all of the menus and buttons did in the previous chapter, to just get the Mobile Previewer working, it is important to know all of the tools at your disposal, as one of the most important things a game developer can do is to know what tool to use to do a certain task. So you can make whatever you imagine appear on the screen.<a class="indexterm" id="id60"/>
</p><p>To an extent, this will only really come with time, although I would definitely recommend exploring the interface and all the features shown in the screenshot by clicking on them and simply experimenting with them as much as possible (and not towards the end of an actual project), so that the basics of the interface eventually become second nature to you. I should also note that I will not cover all of the interface; some of it refers to advanced features that we don't need for now or won't be able to use due to our goal in creating an iOS game, though I will touch on some features not used briefly due to their importance in non-iOS games, should you want to do multi-platform development.<a class="indexterm" id="id61"/>

<span class="strong"><strong>Modes</strong></span> contain all of the different ways of interfacing with your level. Specifically, it contains the following functions:<a class="indexterm" id="id63"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Camera Mode</strong></span>: This is UDK's basic default camera mode. You will be working in this one quite a lot!<a class="indexterm" id="id64"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Geometry Mode</strong></span>: This brings up the basic tools for editing geometry and in particular CSG brushes. (For manipulations similar in many ways to what you would do in an application, such as Autodesk's 3D Studio Max). One of the nice things it allows us to do is build objects to the grid making it easier to not get holes in our level. We will be using it extensively in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Bringing it All Together">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Bringing It All Together</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id65"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Terrain Editing Mode</strong></span>: This mode is used for the creation of terrains.<a class="indexterm" id="id66"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Texture Alignment Mode</strong></span>: This mode is used for aligning textures properly on brushes with operations such as rotation, among others.<a class="indexterm" id="id67"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Mesh Paint Mode</strong></span>: This is an in-editor vertex color painting tool.<a class="indexterm" id="id68"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Static Mesh Mode</strong></span>: This is a tool to assist with quick static mesh additions in a level (via speeding up their placement process).

<span class="strong"><strong>Brushes</strong></span> are the geometry that we can bring into the world. The following are the possible options of things we can create, and we will discuss what the geometry really is and how it works after we discuss the interface. The following features are available in brushes:<a class="indexterm" id="id73"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Cube</strong></span>: This is a cube/box-shaped brush builder<a class="indexterm" id="id74"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Cone</strong></span>: This is a cone-shaped brush builder<a class="indexterm" id="id75"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Curved Staircase</strong></span>: This is a curved staircase brush builder<a class="indexterm" id="id76"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Cylinder</strong></span>: This is a cylinder-shaped brush builder<a class="indexterm" id="id77"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Linear Staircase</strong></span>: This is a standard, straight staircase brush builder<a class="indexterm" id="id78"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sheet</strong></span>: This is a flat 2D plane-like brush builder (where subdivisions can also be added, if needed)<a class="indexterm" id="id79"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Spiral Staircase</strong></span>: This is another curved staircase brush builder, this time however with no restrictions in the angle of the base used (the previous Curved Staircase one had a restriction of 360 degrees on this, hence the spiral name for this one rather than a curve)<a class="indexterm" id="id80"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Tetrahedron (Sphere)</strong></span>: This is a sphere-like CSG brushes builder<a class="indexterm" id="id81"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Cards</strong></span>: This is a brush builder which, because of its appearance, can be utilized for the creation of various special/visual effects with the use of textures such as low-cost trees by using two textures instead of a model<a class="indexterm" id="id82"/></li></ul></div><p>Refer to the screenshot for these options:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Brushes" src="graphics/image_1901_02_03.jpg" width="59"/></div><p>The next part of the toolbox contains the brush CSG operations (again, see the next section<span class="emphasis"><em> Volumes and Select</em></span> for a more thorough explanation of the terms, suffice it to say these are key in shaping brushes into a meaningful and playable level):<a class="indexterm" id="id83"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span>: This uses the last selection of the brush-builder mode, and with that, as a template, creates an additive brush in the level<a class="indexterm" id="id84"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Subtract</strong></span>: This is used in the same way as the preceding option, but this time there is the creation of a subtractive brush<a class="indexterm" id="id85"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Intersect</strong></span>: This will only show the section of a brush that overlaps other intersecting brushes with the rest not being visible<a class="indexterm" id="id86"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Deintersect</strong></span>: This results in the inverse of the previous operation<a class="indexterm" id="id87"/></li></ul></div><p>These are shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Brushes" src="graphics/image_1901_02_04.jpg" width="74"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Volumes and Select"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec03"/>Volumes and Select</h3></div></div></div><p>

Volumes are invisible, but can be used for all sorts of effects like creating water, lava, or triggering different events. Feel free to play around and see all of the kinds of things you can do. We will be using many different kinds of volumes in this book.<a class="indexterm" id="id89"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Show Selected Only</strong></span>: This is useful (as with the other three selection buttons) in order to make selections in a busy and/or cluttered level; this is a tool for displaying exclusively the selected actors in your editor/game level.<a class="indexterm" id="id90"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Hide Selected</strong></span>: This is a tool for hiding the selected actors in your level (the reverse of the preceding function).<a class="indexterm" id="id91"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Invert Selection</strong></span>: This is a tool for inverting the previous actions.<a class="indexterm" id="id92"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Show All</strong></span>: This is a reset tool for the actions of selecting where all actors are now displayed in the editor again.<a class="indexterm" id="id93"/></li></ul></div><p>Refer to the screenshot for these features:<a class="indexterm" id="id94"/>

Again, these can be very handy and useful, maybe not so much with what we are doing in this chapter (as you would be hard pressed to lose your builder brush in a level consisting of one room!) but as soon as your game starts expanding, you will find that you will be using them more and more in order to save time looking through your increasingly complex UDK editor structures. The following screenshot shows this tool:<a class="indexterm" id="id95"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Go to and Builder Brush" src="graphics/image_1901_02_06.jpg" width="68"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Viewport toolbar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec05"/>Viewport toolbar</h3></div></div></div><p>Now let's look at the<span class="strong"><strong> Viewport</strong></span> toolbar. Each of the viewports that you are currently using has a set of icons above them which we refer to as the Viewport toolbar. By default, UDK uses four viewports like most 3D modeling programs. However, there are other options which we will be talking about in <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Action Sequences for Urban Warrior">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Acti on Sequences for Urban Warrior</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id96"/>
</p><p>We have the following viewports from left-hand side to right-hand side:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Viewport Options</strong></span>: This makes a number of options available to you, for example, showing frames per second within the viewport. It should be noted that many can be switched on and off (like the aforementioned one, for example) but are also available as icons (discussed as follows).<a class="indexterm" id="id97"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Viewport Type</strong></span>: You can switch between<span class="strong"><strong> Perspective, Top, Front</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> Side</strong></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id98"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Real Time</strong></span>: This will show what the game will look like at runtime, turning on sound effects and particle systems. This does however have an effect on editor speed and performance so it is to be used sparingly and/or only when necessary.<a class="indexterm" id="id99"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The next 11 icons from<span class="strong"><strong> Brush Wireframe</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> Lighting Only with Texel Density</strong></span> switch the various views in the viewport to whichever one required by the user.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Game View</strong></span>: This showcases the visualization that would be seen in runtime (for example, click on the default Perspective Viewport to see all wireframes disappear).<a class="indexterm" id="id100"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Lock Viewport</strong></span>: This is self-explanatory to an extent but will lock not the viewport itself, but the<span class="strong"><strong> Go to</strong></span> actions described previously.<a class="indexterm" id="id101"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Lock Selected Actors to Camera</strong></span>: This will "lock" the next actor selection (after the button/icon is clicked) to the viewport camera. You can then move the camera and click this again and the actor will also be moved. This is essentially a handy tool for moving parts of the level/game in the viewport in a very rapid manner.<a class="indexterm" id="id102"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Level Streaming Volume Previs and Post Process Volume Previs</strong></span>: This will enable streaming and post-processing manipulations to be visualized in the given/selected viewport.

I will run through this in a quicker fashion as opposed to the previous features since the majority of the functions are replicated (we have already covered them and they are duplicated in different parts of the toolbar menus) and some of these are more advanced and I would like to avoid overcomplicating the first few steps in UDK that we are making in this chapter. It is still however worth quickly looking through these as there are many useful options here too.<a class="indexterm" id="id146"/>
</p><p>These are the main menu bar options:</p><div class="section" title="File"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec07"/>File</h3></div></div></div><p>Like most programs, under the<span class="strong"><strong> File</strong></span> menu you will be able to open files, save them, and create new ones. You have the opportunity to import files into your level or export your level into a file as well. The bottom of the menu allows you to easily select your favorite levels as well as those you've recently opened.<a class="indexterm" id="id147"/>
</p><p>Note that<span class="strong"><strong> Save</strong></span> does not have a shortcut in UDK and by clicking<span class="emphasis"><em> Ctrl+S</em></span> you are actually creating a subtractive brush.

You also have access to<span class="strong"><strong> Cut, Copy, Paste, Duplicate</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> Delete</strong></span> functionality of objects inside your level. The bottom section allows for different ways to select different objects' of note is<span class="strong"><strong> Find Actors</strong></span> which will bring you to a menu showing you everything in your level, making it easy to find something specific you're looking for.<a class="indexterm" id="id148"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="View"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec09"/>View</h3></div></div></div><p>The<span class="strong"><strong> View</strong></span> menu offers the ability to see all of the windows available inside of UDK. All of the different types of browser windows can be accessed as well as the properties of an actor, surface, or the level itself. You can adjust the properties of snapping that the level does in how far you can drag, scale, and rotate an object. There are options to customize your own UDK interface as well, such as changing your viewports or toggling the use of full screen mode.<a class="indexterm" id="id149"/>

All these options are shown in the following screenshot:<a class="indexterm" id="id153"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Tools" height="17" src="graphics/image_1901_02_10.jpg"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Preferences"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec14"/>Preferences</h3></div></div></div><p>The<span class="strong"><strong> Preferences</strong></span> toolbar, which is the longest toolbar, has many different options which can toggle on or off to customize your UDK experience. It is also worth noting that a lot of people starting out will often check or uncheck something here, often by using a keyboard shortcut or by mistake, and then be very perplexed when something does not work right or is not visible! For that reason, it is worth knowing about the options so you can try to solve the problem by yourself. The following screenshot shows us the options available in preferences:<a class="indexterm" id="id154"/>
<a class="indexterm" id="id155"/>

</p></div></div><div class="section" title="The console bar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec04"/>The console bar</h2></div></div></div><p>To finish with our look at the interface, let's finally focus at the bottom of the screen at what is known as the<span class="strong"><strong> console bar</strong></span>. Refer to the following screenshot:<a class="indexterm" id="id157"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="The console bar" height="15" src="graphics/image_1901_02_12.jpg"/></div><p>At this part, there is a command line in which you can input console commands directly into the Unreal Editor. We will be using console commands later in the book, but inside the actual game and not the editor, but the option exists.<a class="indexterm" id="id158"/>
</p><p>In addition, there is a<span class="strong"><strong> Source Control</strong></span> icon (which is not set up by default), a lighting and paths build status button and a package icon.<a class="indexterm" id="id159"/>
</p><p>Moving towards the bottom right of this part of the UDK editor, you can also get information on your mouse cursor position (coordinates) and, if you have an object selected, information about the object itself.</p><p>Additionally, you can perform manual operations on items using the four DrawScale textboxes (<span class="strong"><strong>DrawScale</strong></span> plus<span class="strong"><strong> DrawScale3D X, DrawScale3D Y</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> DrawScale3D Z</strong></span>). There are the Drag, Rotation, and Scale Grids as well that are something incredibly important to have turned on when creating your level. With the option is disabled, when an item is translated it can be moved to any position causing holes. For example, if you are trying to create a door by using a subtractive brush being placed over an additive one, if the brushes are off by just a tiny bit the section that is not covered by the brush will form a wall. When building our actual game level we will be using this to great effect.</p><p>Finally, auto-save features are also found here which will automatically save the map to a backup file in case Unreal crashes and/or breaks your level. Better to be safe than sorry! The following screenshot shows all these settings:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="The console bar" height="12" src="graphics/image_1901_02_13.jpg"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Keyboard shortcuts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec05"/>Keyboard shortcuts</h2></div></div></div><p>One final note; keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>UDK, as with all 3D design applications makes extensive use of these (as you have seen from screenshots already) and you can use your keyboard to your heart's content here. One piece of advice however; if you use other 3D applications (or indeed ANY applications with shortcuts), be aware because UDK is a complex tool and you may, as I mentioned earlier, initiate something by mistake or change a setting you did not want to change simply because you did not remember the right keyboard shortcut at the time.<a class="indexterm" id="id160"/>
</p><p>This happens to the best of us, but it would be best to avoid it if we can.</p><p>That being said, as the book continues on in addition to showing how to access things from menus, I will introduce the shortcuts that I personally use on a common basis while working with the tool.<a class="indexterm" id="id161"/>

Brushes, on the other hand, are three-dimensional objects that are used to define space. We define that space in four different ways:<span class="strong"><strong> Add, Subtract, Intersect</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> Deintersect</strong></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id162"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Static meshes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec17"/>Static meshes</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Static meshes</strong></span>, on the other hand, are polygonal creations that can also be used for the formation of a game level in Unreal/UDK which are not moving within the world, but don't worry, we'll also cover how to create moving objects as well in a future chapter. In this chapter, we will be placing meshes to give our environment something other than walls to see.<a class="indexterm" id="id163"/>
</p><p>Later in this book, we will be looking at importing static meshes into UDK from a 3D modeling package, thus showcasing the limitless potential of world creation and world mesh population of the engine, given some basic 3D asset creation skills from the developer.</p></div><div class="section" title="The differences between CSG brushes and static meshes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec18"/>The differences between CSG brushes and static meshes</h3></div></div></div><p>So what are the differences then between using brushes and/or static meshes? Why use one or the other?</p><p>You should be aware that today static meshes are really the professional's choice in world creation in UDK, for two simple reasons: performance and aesthetics. It is much faster to use static meshes and (provided you use quality ones!) they will look much, much better than brushes. Brushes have also had or led to their fair share of problems such as causing holes, and static meshes have provided the much needed solution to resolving such inefficiencies.<a class="indexterm" id="id164"/>
</p><p>However, there is still a place for brushes. In the game industry, many game designers will block out a level using brushes and get the scripting working correctly. That way the designer is able to focus on making the game fun and making sure the functionality of the level is completed to make sure that everything will work. We will be using this mindset for this chapter and in the next chapters up to <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Bringing it All Together">Chapter 6</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Bringing It All Together</em></span>. With the level completed, a level designer can then give the level to an environmental artist who will then replace the brushes with meshes that they've created, which is what we will be doing in <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Advanced Content Creation for Urban Warrior">Chapter 7</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Advanced Content Creation for Urban Warrior</em></span>.

One possible option is to tile (multiply) textures further in a certain area. This is so that the proportions, according to the size of the room, become more realistic rather than skewed (which can spoil the illusion of any virtual world in a game). You will be doing quite a lot of this for your own games/levels.
