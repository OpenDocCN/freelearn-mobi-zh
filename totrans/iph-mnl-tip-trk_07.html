			<p>You can't take a picture without a camera. That's why the best camera is one that you have with you, and for many people, that camera is in their iPhone. Over the years, the iPhone's camera has steadily improved, to the point where it's now equal or superior to many standalone cameras. Many professional photographers even rely solely on the iPhone's camera to capture both still and video images that are indistinguishable from still and video images captured by standalone cameras.</p>
			<p>Of course, you don't have to know anything about photography to enjoy the iPhone's camera. All you need to know is how to take pictures, edit them later if you wish, save them, and share them with others. Taking pictures can be fun for anyone, so feel free to point your iPhone camera at any interesting image to capture your memories.</p>
			<p>The topics we will cover in the chapter are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Capturing still images and video</li>
				<li>Viewing and organizing pictures and videos</li>
				<li>Editing pictures and videos</li>
				<li>Sharing pictures and videos</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/>Capturing still images</h1>
			<p>Despite its small size, the iPhone's camera can<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> capture amazing pictures. To help you capture the best still images possible, the Camera app offers several options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">PHOTO</strong>: Captures still images</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">SQUARE</strong>: Captures still images in a square, which is the optimal photo size for many social media apps</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">PORTRAIT</strong>: Captures a subject while blurring the background</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">PANO</strong>: Captures panoramic still images<a id="_idTextAnchor324"/><a id="_idTextAnchor325"/></li>
			</ul>
			<p>When capturing still images, you have several <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>additional options, such as turning flash on (or off), using <strong class="bold">HDR</strong> (<strong class="bold">High Dynamic Range</strong>), turning Live <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>on (or off), setting a timer, or adjusting the color tone.</p>
			<p>Flash is often used in poor lighting. If you turn flash on, you'll get to choose from three options: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Auto</strong>: Auto means you let the iPhone decide whether to use flash or not. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">On</strong>: On means flash always occurs</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Off</strong>: Off means flash never occurs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>HDR is meant to capture differences<a id="_idIndexMarker407"/> between light and dark images. Without HDR, you can focus on a tree (slightly blurring everything else) or focus on the sky behind the tree (slightly blurring the tree). HDR captures all images equally well. Like the flash option, the HDR options are <strong class="bold">Auto</strong>, <strong class="bold">On</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Off</strong>.</p>
			<p>Live <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>captures a 3-second moving image and audio, plus an additional 1.5 seconds after you capture the image. When viewing an image captured with Live Photos, you'll briefly see the images move. </p>
			<p>Setting a timer lets you define a 3- or 10-second delay. This gives you time to set the camera and get into position before the camera actually captures an image.</p>
			<p>Color tones lets you adjust the appearance of an image by making colors appear brighter or black and white. By choosing different color tones, you can improve an image or capture an artistic view of an image.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>Capturing a photo or square image</h2>
			<p>The iPhone's camera makes it easy to<a id="_idIndexMarker408"/> simply point and shoot to capture any image. The <strong class="bold">PHOTO</strong> option is the most common setting for capturing still images, but the <strong class="bold">SQUARE</strong> option can be handy for capturing images in a size best suited for social media apps.</p>
			<p>To capture a still image with the <strong class="bold">PHOTO</strong> or <strong class="bold">SQUARE</strong> settings, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Camera screen appears.</li>
				<li>Swipe left or right on the settings options to choose <strong class="bold">PHOTO</strong> or <strong class="bold">SQUARE</strong> so that it appears directly over the white button and appears highlighted in yellow, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.1</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.1 – The Camera app's settings options&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1 – The Camera app's settings options</p></li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the camera icon with two circular arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen to toggle between the front and back camera.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the flash icon in the upper-left corner of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.2</em>, and choose <strong class="bold">Auto</strong>, <strong class="bold">On</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Off</strong>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.2 – The options at the top of the screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.2 – The options at the top of the screen</p></li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the <strong class="bold">HDR</strong> icon at the top<a id="_idIndexMarker409"/> of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.2</em>) and choose <strong class="bold">Auto</strong>, <strong class="bold">On</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Off</strong>.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the Live <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>icon at the top of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.2</em>) to toggle Live <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>on or off.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the timer icon at the top of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.2</em>) and choose <strong class="bold">Off</strong>, <strong class="bold">3s</strong>, or <strong class="bold">10s</strong>.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the color tone icon at the top of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.2</em>) and scroll left and right through the list of color options near the bottom of the screen, such as <strong class="bold">VIVID WARM</strong> or <strong class="bold">DRAMATIC COOL</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.3</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.3 – Choosing different color tones for a still image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.03_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.3 – Choosing different color tones for a still image</p></li>
				<li>Tap the white shutter button to capture your image. <a id="_idTextAnchor327"/><a id="_idTextAnchor328"/> </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Still images are useful for almost<a id="_idIndexMarker410"/> any type of subject you wish to capture, from landscapes and people to objects and animals. However, if you want to capture a person, you might want to use a special setting called <strong class="bold">PORTRAIT</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor329"/>Capturing a portrait image</h2>
			<p>Portrait mode is best when you want to focus on a <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>person and blur any background images around that person. When capturing a still image in portrait mode, you can choose between several light settings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">NATURAL</strong> <strong class="bold">LIGHT</strong>: Keeps the person's face in focus and blurs the background</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">STUDIO</strong> <strong class="bold">LIGHT</strong>: Lights up a person's face and blurs the background</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">CONTOUR</strong> <strong class="bold">LIGHT</strong>: Casts shadows on a person's face to provide greater contrast</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">STAGE</strong> <strong class="bold">LIGHT</strong>: Blacks out the background so that only the person's face is seen</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">STAGE</strong> <strong class="bold">LIGHT</strong> <strong class="bold">MONO</strong>: Just like <strong class="bold">Stage Light</strong> except displays everything in black and white.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">HIGH-KEY</strong> <strong class="bold">MONO</strong>: Just like <strong class="bold">Stage Light Mono</strong> but displays a white background</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To capture a still image with the <strong class="bold">PORTRAIT</strong> setting, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Camera screen appears.</li>
				<li>Swipe left or right on the settings <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>options to choose <strong class="bold">PORTRAIT</strong> so that it appears directly over the white button and appears highlighted in yellow (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.1</em>). Frame your subject within the white corner borders, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.4</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.4 – PORTRAIT displays four white corners to frame your subject&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.4 – PORTRAIT displays four white corners to frame your subject</p></li>
				<li>(Optional) tap a lighting option, such as <strong class="bold">NATURAL LIGHT</strong> or <strong class="bold">CONTOUR LIGHT</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.5</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.5 – Choosing a lighting option&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.5 – Choosing a lighting option</p></li>
				<li>Tap the white button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Portrait mode is optimized just for <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>capturing images of people. If you want to capture landscapes, then you might prefer the panoramic setting.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor330"/>Capturing a panoramic image</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">PANO</strong> option to capture panoramic<a id="_idIndexMarker414"/> views can be useful for capturing an image wider than the iPhone's camera can normally capture. By moving your iPhone from left to right, you can capture a wide image, such as the Grand Canyon. </p>
			<p>To capture a panoramic view, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Camera screen appears.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">PANO</strong> in the settings options (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.1</em>). A white arrow appears next to a yellow horizontal line, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.6</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.6 – Starting to capture a panoramic view&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.6 – Starting to capture a panoramic view</p></li>
				<li>Aim the iPhone camera to<a id="_idIndexMarker415"/> the left of the panoramic view you want to capture and then tap the white button to start capturing a panoramic view. </li>
				<li>Slowly move the iPhone to the right, keeping the white arrow as level as possible along the yellow horizontal line, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.7</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.7 – Capturing a panoramic view&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.07_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.7 – Capturing a panoramic view</p></li>
				<li>Tap the white stop button when you're done capturing the panoramic view.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>While you can use the iPhone<a id="_idIndexMarker416"/> cameras to capture any image you can point at, what if you want to show someone a picture of your current screen? Since the iPhone's camera can't point at the screen, you'll need to know how to capture screenshots.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor331"/>Capturing screenshots</h2>
			<p>Screenshots let you capture images that <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>appear on your screen. If you find an interesting website or a unique app, you might want to capture an image to share with others. </p>
			<p>To capture a screenshot, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Display something on your iPhone screen that you want to capture, such as a game or a web page.</li>
				<li>For iPhone models without a Home button, press the Side button and volume up button at the same time, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.8</em> (for iPhone models with a Home button, press the Home button and the Side button at the same time):</li>
			</ol>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.8 – Capturing a screenshot with different iPhone models</p>
			<p>Capturing still images can be fun, but <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>sometimes, you may wish to record video images instead. Fortunately, the iPhone camera can double as both a still image camera and a video camera.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/>Recording video</h1>
			<p>Besides capturing still images, the iPhone <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>camera can also record video. Instead of carrying around a camera and a camcorder, the iPhone gives you both in one camera. </p>
			<p>Some of the different ways you can capture<a id="_idIndexMarker420"/> video include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Video</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time lapse</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Slow motion</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>Recording ordinary video</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">VIDEO</strong> option lets you capture events <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>as they happen without any added modification. By shooting video instead of still images, you can not only capture motion but also ensure that you capture that perfect shot.</p>
			<p>To record video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Camera screen appears.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">VIDEO</strong> in the settings options. The record button appears as a red circle, replacing the white shutter button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.9</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.9 – A red record button lets you know that you're recording video&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.9 – A red record button lets you know that you're recording video</p></li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the camera icon with the two circular arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen to toggle between the front and back camera.</li>
				<li>Tap the red recording button to start recording video. The bottom of the Camera app screen now displays a white button and a red square button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.10</em>. The white button lets you capture still images, while the red square button represents the stop recording button:<div><img alt="Figure 7.10 – The white and red buttons&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.10_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.10 – The white and red buttons</p></li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the white button<a id="_idIndexMarker422"/> to capture a still image.</li>
				<li>Tap the red square stop button to stop recording video.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Recording ordinary video is fine for most occasions, but you might also want to record a time-lapse video, which can be handy for creating interesting visual effects.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor334"/>Recording time-lapse video</h2>
			<p>If you've ever seen videos of LEGO pieces moving <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>around, or inanimate objects such as pencils, coffee mugs, or toy cars appearing to move on their own, it was likely captured using time-lapse photography.</p>
			<p>Time-lapse photography works by capturing images periodically. This gives you time to move inanimate objects around or just capture ordinary images, which creates an unusual video effect like old-fashioned video cameras that couldn't capture motion smoothly. </p>
			<p>To record a time-lapse video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Camera screen appears.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">TIME-LAPSE</strong> in the settings options. The record button appears as a red circle with tick marks surrounding it, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.11</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.11 – Capturing time-lapse video&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.11_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.11 – Capturing time-lapse video</p></li>
				<li>Tap the red record button to start recording a time-lapse video. The white tick marks around the record button start filling the outer edges to let you know when the camera will capture another image, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.12</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.12 – Displaying the time until the camera captures another image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.12 – Displaying the time until the camera captures another image</p></li>
				<li>Tap the red square to stop<a id="_idIndexMarker424"/> recording the time-lapse video.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Time-lapse video may be good at creating interesting visual effects, but if you're capturing fast motion, you may want to capture it in slow motion instead. That way, you'll be able to study the motion in more detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"/>Recording slow motion video</h2>
			<p>If you've ever watched a sporting event, the broadcasters <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>often replay particularly interesting scenes in slow motion. That way, you can clearly see the details that were easily missed in the speed and short time frame of the activity.</p>
			<p>So, if you want to capture fast-moving action, or just want to experiment with an interesting visual effect, the iPhone can also capture slow motion video.  </p>
			<p>To record slow motion video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Camera screen appears.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">SLO-MO</strong> in the settings options. The record button appears as a red circle with tick marks surrounding it, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.13</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.13 – Recording slow motion video&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.13_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.13 – Recording slow motion video</p></li>
				<li>Tap the red button again to stop recording the slow motion video. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each time you capture either<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> still images or videos, your iPhone stores those images in the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app. That's where you can search, sort, edit, and delete any pictures or<a id="_idTextAnchor336"/><a id="_idTextAnchor337"/> videos.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor338"/>Using the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app stores all captured still images <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>and videos. Within the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app, you <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>can view, edit, and send images and videos. By keeping all your pictures and videos in one place, the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app ensures you never lose track of any important pictures or videos.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app hold all your still images and videos, whether you have one image or a thousand. To help you find a particular image or video, you can organize items into several categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Library</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">For You</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Albums</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Library</strong> category contains all images and videos, organized in chronological order. By scrolling up and down, you can view past and current images and videos, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.14</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.14 – The Library category displays images in rows and columns&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.14_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.14 – The Library category displays images in rows and columns</p>
			<p>When browsing through your images<a id="_idIndexMarker429"/> and videos, you can identify videos because they display their time length in the bottom-right corner, such as <strong class="bold">7:29</strong> or <strong class="bold">1:36</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.15</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.15 – Identifying a video by its time length display&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.15_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.15 – Identifying a video by its time length display</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">For You</strong> category automatically organizes related image and videos based on time, location, or subject. That<a id="_idIndexMarker430"/> way, you can find related images that form a memory of an occasion or subject, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.16</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.16 – The For You category automatically groups related items&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.16_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.16 – The For You category automatically groups related items</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Albums</strong> category lets you manually choose which images and videos to group together. This lets you create albums that reflect certain moods or that contain items from different time periods or locations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor339"/>Viewing images and videos in the photos category</h2>
			<p>Viewing images and<a id="_idIndexMarker431"/> videos in the photos category lets you see everything saved on your iPhone. This ensures that you won't miss an item but can also be troublesome if you store hundreds or thousands of images. </p>
			<p>When viewing images and videos in the photos category, you can increase or decrease the size of each item so that it appears smaller or larger. That way, you'll be able to see more items or focus on the details of fewer items. </p>
			<p>To view items in the photos category, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Library</strong> on the tab bar at the bottom of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">All Photos </strong>at the bottom of the screen. Your images and videos appear as thumbnail tiles on the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.14</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">…</strong> icon in the upper-right corner<a id="_idIndexMarker432"/> of the screen. This will display a menu, so you can choose <strong class="bold">Zoom In</strong> or <strong class="bold">Zoom Out</strong> to increase or decrease the magnification of the list of stored images, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.17</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.17 – Zooming in or out lets you view more or fewer stored images&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.17 – Zooming in or out lets you view more or fewer stored images</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Years</strong>, <strong class="bold">Months</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Days</strong> at the bottom of the screen. This groups your images by year, month, or day, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.18</em> (<strong class="bold">All Photos </strong>lets you view all images and videos stored in the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app):<div><img alt="Figure 7.18 – Grouping images by time&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.18 – Grouping images by time</p></li>
				<li>Tap the image you want to view. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Selecting an image to <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>view through the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> category can be cumbersome if you have a large number of images. For a potentially faster method, consider browsing the <strong class="bold">For You</strong> category.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor340"/>Viewing images and videos in the For You category</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">For You</strong> category automatically<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> groups related images and videos together, which makes it easier to look for similar images. </p>
			<p>To view images in the <strong class="bold">For You</strong> category, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Photos</strong><strong class="bold"> </strong>app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">For You</strong> on the tab bar at the bottom of the screen. Categories of your images appear (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.16</em>).</li>
				<li>Scroll through your images and tap the one you wa<a id="_idTextAnchor341"/><a id="_idTextAnchor342"/>nt to view.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>One unique feature of the <strong class="bold">For You</strong> category is that it lets you create slideshows, complete with music, so you can enjoy your images and share them with others.</p>
			<p>To view a <strong class="bold">For You</strong> slideshow, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">For You</strong> on the tab bar at the bottom of the screen.

				<li>Tap on a category to display a play button at the bottom-right corner of a <strong class="bold">For You</strong> category. Then, tap the play<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> button to watch a slideshow presentation, complete with music.</li>
				<li>Tap a different type of music to play, such as <strong class="bold">GENTLE</strong> or <strong class="bold">CHILL</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.20</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.20 – Modifying a For You slideshow&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.20_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.20 – Modifying a For You slideshow</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">SHORT</strong> or <strong class="bold">MEDIUM</strong> to choose <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>a different length for your slideshow.</li>
				<li>Tap the play/pause button to play or pause your slideshow.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor343"/>Creating albums to organize images and videos</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app can automatically <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>organize images and videos by time, location, or subject. However, you may want to organize images and videos into your own groups, called albums.</p>
			<p>Just as you can put different pictures in physical album binders, so can you put different pictures in virtual albums in the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app. Unlike the physical world, where you can only put a picture in one album, the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app lets you store the same picture in as many different albums as you wish.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Albums</strong> category automatically sorts images and video into albums such as <strong class="bold">Videos</strong>, <strong class="bold">Selfies</strong>, <strong class="bold">Live Photos</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Panoramas</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.21</em>:</p>

			</ol>
			<p>While the default albums available might be handy for organizing your images and videos, you might want to organize images yourself. In that case, you can create an album and choose which images to store.</p>
			<p>When creating an<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> album, you can create an ordinary album or a shared album. A shared album lets others view and edit the album by storing images in iCloud, while an ordinary album is stored on your iPhone.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">To create a shared album, you'll need to make sure you turn on iCloud by going to <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">[your name]</strong> | <strong class="bold">iCloud</strong> | <strong class="bold">Photos</strong>, then turning on <strong class="bold">Shared Albums</strong>.</p>

			</ol>
			<p>Albums can be a handy way to <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>organize your pictures and videos. Each time you capture a picture, it might be perfect, or it might be almost perfect. For those almost-perfect pictures, consider modifying them to make them exactly how you want. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor344"/>Editing images and videos</h1>
			<p>Many people happily use the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> simply to view their pictures. However, you might want to <a id="_idIndexMarker444"/>modify any pictures you capture, either to improve them or to get creative and silly with them. To edit images and videos, the first step is to select the image or video you want to modify. </p>
			<p>If you want to modify images or videos, you can choose from one of the following categories of editing tools:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Live Photos </strong>(still images only): Lets you choose which frame within a live photo to use</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Video</strong> (video only): Lets you adjust the starting and ending point of a video</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adjust</strong>: Lets you modify brightness, exposure, contrast, and other features </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Filters</strong>: Lets you choose different<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> ways to alter the overall appearance of an image or video</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reset</strong>: Lets you rotate, crop, and adjust the <a id="_idIndexMarker446"/>position of an image or video</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor345"/>Editing Live Photos</h2>
			<p>Live <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>capture a 1.5-second recording <a id="_idIndexMarker447"/>before and after you take a picture. That way, you get a brief amount of movement and sound. Not only do Live <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>move when you first look at them, but they also give you the option of selecting which frame within a Live Photo might look best.</p>
			<p>For example, suppose you took a picture of a little kid. However, just as you captured the picture, the kid shut their eyes. With Live Photo editing, you could view the 1.5-second images before and after the picture to see whether you actually caught a picture with the kid's eyes open. Then, you could select that frame to use instead.</p>
			<p>To edit a Live Photo, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the Live Photo you want to edit. You can identify Live <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>because they display <strong class="bold">LIVE</strong> at the upper-left corner, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.26</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.26 – Identifying a Live Photo&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.26_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.26 – Identifying a Live Photo</p></li>
				<li>Swipe up on the Live Photo. A list of visual effects appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.27</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.27 – Choosing a visual effect for a Live Photo&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.27_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.27 – Choosing a visual effect for a Live Photo</p></li>
				<li>Tap on a visual effect you<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> want to use, such as <strong class="bold">Loop</strong> or <strong class="bold">Bounce</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen. A list of different editing icons appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.28</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.28 – The list of editing icons&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.28_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.28 – The list of editing icons</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Live Photo</strong> icon. Multiple frames of your Live Photo appear, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.29</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.29 – Viewing multiple frames of a Live Photo&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.29_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.29 – Viewing multiple frames of a Live Photo</p></li>
				<li>Select the frame (highlighted within a white rectangle) that <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>you want to use for your picture. A <strong class="bold">Make Key Photo</strong> button appears over the frame you selected.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Make Key Photo</strong> to select the chosen frame, or tap <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>By default, your iPhone will capture Live Photos, but you can always turn this feature on and off at any time. In most cases, you want to capture Live <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>because it gives you the option later of selecting a better image. For another way to capture the best possible image, consider capturing video instead.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor346"/>Trimming a video</h2>
			<p>The simplest way to edit video<a id="_idIndexMarker450"/> is to define the beginning and end to make the video shorter. By trimming the beginning or end, you can eliminate extra scenes that you don't need.</p>
			<p>To trim a video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the video you want to edit. You can identify videos because they display their time length in the bottom-right corner, such as <strong class="bold">4:18</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen. The individual frames of the video appear underneath the video, with a white curved line representing the beginning and end of the video, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.30</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.30 – Trimming a video&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.30_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.30 – Trimming a video</p></li>
				<li>Drag the beginning and/or end of the<a id="_idIndexMarker451"/> video to define a new start and end time, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.31</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.31 – A trimmed video appears highlighted in yellow&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.31_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.31 – A trimmed video appears highlighted in yellow</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Many times, you might capture an<a id="_idIndexMarker452"/> image or video that looks almost perfect, but not quite. That's why you might want to spend a little time modifying the appearance of an image or video, such as changing the contrast, brightness, or saturation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor347"/>Adjusting the appearance of an image or video</h2>
			<p>Sometimes, you<a id="_idIndexMarker453"/> may capture an image or video that's too bright or too dark, but might otherwise be perfect. Rather than trying to capture that same image again (which might be <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>impossible), you can try adjusting the image or video's appearance by lightening or darkening the image or video.</p>
			<p>To lighten or darken an image or video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the image or video you want to edit.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the adjust icon at<a id="_idIndexMarker455"/> the bottom of the screen. Icons appear for <a id="_idIndexMarker456"/>adjusting the lightness or darkness of the image.</li>
				<li>Tap an icon such as <strong class="bold">EXPOSURE</strong> or <strong class="bold">BRILLIANCE</strong>. A horizontal scale appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.32</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.32 – Different options for adjusting lightness and darkness&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.32_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.32 – Different options for adjusting lightness and darkness</p></li>
				<li>Swipe left or right on this horizontal scale to adjust your chosen options by a positive or negative numerical value, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.33</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.33 – Different options for adjusting lightness and darkness&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.33_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.33 – Different options for adjusting lightness and darkness</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong> when you're happy with the appearance (or tap <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Lightening or darkening<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> an image or video is one way to correct an image, but for <a id="_idIndexMarker458"/>a more artistic option, you can apply filters over an image or video. Filters simply modify an image in a uniform manner, such as making it appear black and white or brighter.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor348"/>Applying filters to an image or video</h2>
			<p>Filters offer a quick way to <a id="_idIndexMarker459"/>modify an image or video by applying a uniform change, such as<a id="_idIndexMarker460"/> muting or sharpening the appearance of colors. By experimenting with different filters, you can either correct an image or video, or create a unique visual effect.</p>
			<p>To apply a filter to an image or video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the image or video you want to edit.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the filters icon at the bottom of the screen. Frames appear, showing how the image or video will look under each filter, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.34</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.34 – Choosing a filter&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.34_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.34 – Choosing a filter</p></li>
				<li>Tap a filter, and then tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong> (or <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Filters can alter the <a id="_idIndexMarker461"/>overall appearance of an image or video, but what if you captured<a id="_idIndexMarker462"/> the perfect shot but it's slightly crooked? That's when you may need to choose a reset option to flip, rotate, or change the physical orientation of an image or video.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor349"/>Resetting the orientation of an image or video</h2>
			<p>Resetting an image or video lets you <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>adjust its physical orientation in the following <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Flip</strong>: Displays the mirror image of an image or video</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rotate</strong>: Rotates an image or video 90 degrees to the right</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resize</strong>: Changes the shape of an image, such as making it square or wider</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Straighten</strong>: Rotates an image or video around the <em class="italic">x</em>, <em class="italic">y</em>, and <em class="italic">z</em> axes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To straighten the orientation of an image or video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the image or video you want to edit.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the reset icon at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.35</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.35 – The reset options &#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.35_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.35 – The reset options </p></li>
				<li>Tap one of the <a id="_idIndexMarker465"/>straighten icons that appear underneath the image or video. A grid appears over the image or video.</li>
				<li>Swipe left or right <a id="_idIndexMarker466"/>on the horizontal row of white vertical lines to adjust how much to modify the image or video, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.36</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.36 – A grid appears to help you modify an image or video&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.36_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.36 – A grid appears to help you modify an image or video</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong> (or <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Manually adjusting an image<a id="_idIndexMarker467"/> gives you complete control over its appearance. However, this can be time-consuming, so you might want a faster solution to flip, rotate, or resize<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> an image or video.</p>
			<p>To flip, rotate, or resize an image or video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the image or video you want to edit.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the reset icon at the bottom of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.35</em>).</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the flip icon in the upper-left corner of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.37</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.37 – The flip, rotate, and resize icons&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.37_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.37 – The flip, rotate, and resize icons</p></li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the rotate<a id="_idIndexMarker469"/> icon in the upper-left corner of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.37</em>). Each time you tap the rotate icon, the image or video rotates 90<a id="_idIndexMarker470"/> degrees to the right.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the resize icon. A list of resizing options appears near the bottom of the screen, such as <strong class="bold">FREEFORM</strong>, <strong class="bold">SQUARE</strong>, and <strong class="bold">9:16</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.38</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.38 – Resizing options&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.38_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.38 – Resizing options</p></li>
				<li>Tap a resize option, such as <strong class="bold">SQUARE</strong> or <strong class="bold">8:10</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong> (or <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>One final way you might want to modify an image or video is by cropping, which essentially lets you shrink the area you want to keep. Cropping can be handy to cut off the tops or edges of an image or video to delete the parts of an image or video that aren't necessary.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor350"/>Cropping an image or video</h2>
			<p>Cropping lets you use <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>virtual scissors to cut the edges from an image or video. Cropping always removes parts from an image <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/>or video, so you can eliminate the edges that you don't need to keep.</p>
			<p>To crop an image or video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the image or video you want to edit.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the reset icon at the bottom of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.35</em>). Four thick white crop marks appear around the four corners of the image.</li>
				<li>Move the crop marks to define the part of the picture you want to keep. Any area outside of the crop marks will appear dimmed to show what will be cut out, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.39</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.39 – Cropping an image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.39_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.39 – Cropping an image</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After you are done<a id="_idIndexMarker473"/> fixing or modifying an image or video, you might want to share the image or tag it as<a id="_idIndexMarker474"/> a favorite. Sharing lets others see your pictures, while tagging an image or video as a favorite automatically makes that item appear in the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> album. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor351"/>Tagging and sharing images and videos</h1>
			<p>Not every picture or video you<a id="_idIndexMarker475"/> capture will be great, but for those that you like the best, you can tag them as a<a id="_idIndexMarker476"/> favorite. That way, they'll automatically show up in your <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> album.</p>
			<p>Whether you like a picture or not, you<a id="_idIndexMarker477"/> might want to share it with others. Sharing lets you <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>send images or videos by email, text messaging, or through AirDrop, where you can send items to another Apple device, such as a Macintosh, iPad, or iPhone.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor352"/>Tagging an image or video</h2>
			<p>Tagging an image or video <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>as a favorite <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>helps you find your best pictures quickly and easily.</p>
			<p>To tag an image or video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the image or video you want to tag.</li>
				<li>Tap the favorites icon (the heart) at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.40</em>:</li>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor353"/>Sharing an image or video</h2>
			<p>Half the fun of taking pictures is sharing them<a id="_idIndexMarker481"/> with others, whether privately through email or publicly through a social <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>media app. Some of the different ways to share an image or video include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">AirDrop</strong>: Send an item to another Apple device, such as a Macintosh, iPhone, or iPad.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Messages</strong>: Send an item by text message.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mail</strong>: Send an item as a file attachment by email.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Depending on the apps installed on your iPhone, you may also have the option of sharing an item directly to a social media app such as Twitter or Facebook.</p>
			<p>To share an image or video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the image or video you want to share.</li>
				<li>Tap the share icon (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.40</em>). Your chosen picture appears as a thumbnail along with a blue checkmark in the bottom-right corner.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap any other pictures or videos you want to send as well if you want to share more than one item. A horizontal row of circular icons appears underneath your thumbnail image, listing any nearby AirDrop devices, along with the names of people you've sent a text message to recently. Another horizontal row lists different sharing options, such as <strong class="bold">AirDrop</strong>, <strong class="bold">Messages</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Mail</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.41</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.41 – Choosing how to share an item&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.41_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.41 – Choosing how to share an item</p></li>
				<li>Tap either a destination (nearby Macintosh computers or people you've previously texted) or a sharing option (<strong class="bold">AirDrop</strong>, <strong class="bold">Messages</strong>, <strong class="bold">Mail</strong>, or so on). If you've chosen a sharing option such as <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> or <strong class="bold">Messages</strong>, you'll need to type in additional information, such as<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> an email address or mobile phone number to send your<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> selected item to.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can share items to as many people as you wish, as often as you like. After you share certain pictures or videos, you may not want to keep them, so you need to learn how to delete items as well.</p>

			<p>When you no longer want to<a id="_idIndexMarker485"/> keep an item, delete it. If you change your mind, you can even recover <a id="_idIndexMarker486"/>a deleted item right away. By deleting images and videos, you can make sure your iPhone never runs out of storage.</p>
			<p>To delete an image or video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the image or video you want to delete.</li>
				<li>Tap the delete icon (see <em class="italic">Figure 7.40</em>). A <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> and <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> button appear at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> (or <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you delete an image or video by mistake, you can retrieve that item because the iPhone stores all deleted items in a special <strong class="bold">Recently Deleted</strong> album. </p>
			<p>To retrieve a previously deleted image or video, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app icon on the Home Screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Albums</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Scroll down and tap the <strong class="bold">Recently Deleted</strong> album, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.42</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 7.42 – The Recently Deleted album&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_7.42_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.42 – The Recently Deleted album</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the image or<a id="_idIndexMarker487"/> video you want to retrieve. A <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> and <strong class="bold">Recover</strong> button <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>appear at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Retrieve</strong> to retrieve the deleted item (or tap <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> to permanently delete the item from the <strong class="bold">Recently Deleted</strong> album).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It's a good idea to review the <strong class="bold">Recently Deleted</strong> album periodically to permanently delete any images or videos you know you'll never want to keep again. That way, you can save storage space on your iPhone for important ite<a id="_idTextAnchor355"/>ms, such as apps or new images and videos.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Taking pictures and videos can be a fun way to capture moments in your life and share them with others. Even if you're not a professional photographer, you can still enjoy capturing images and modifying them slightly to correct flaws, or apply unique visual effects for fun. </p>
			<p>While the camera is one of the iPhone's most entertaining features, you might also want to turn your iPhone into a portable music player so that you can listen to music, radio stations, and podcasts wherever you go, which is the subject of the next chapter. </p>
