- en: It has been many years since Apple introduced its first SDK for iPhone development
    (which is what iOS used to be called back then), and in that time, the iOS ecosystem
    has become one of the most powerful ecosystems in the world. With the goal of
    supporting billions of devices with up-to-date technologies, the demand for iOS
    developers remains constantly high.

    view or a button would have been enough to land a job. However, nowadays, these
    tasks are not even asked about in interviews. The knowledge spectrum is so wide
    today that interviewers focus on aspects beyond just basic knowledge.

    has created a diverse hiring process that requires more than just building a simple
    screen. As a result, there is a great need to prepare ourselves in a professional
    and extensive way.

    years in the same workplace or role can have its benefits, but it may also lead
    to a decline in interview skills and hinder growth in new development areas. Moreover,
    for experienced developers, it has been a long time since they completed their
    studies, making it a good opportunity to revisit the basics.'
