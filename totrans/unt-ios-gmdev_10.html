In this chapter we'll explore some of the gameplay scripts needed to implement the play mechanics of our game.<a id="id437" class="indexterm"/>
</p></blockquote></div><p>In this chapter we shall learn:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to add a particle system to our imported models to simulate a weapon</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to use animation to drive events in the game</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to handle ragdoll physics on our character and enemies</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to keep score and trigger events based on gameplay</li></ul></div><p>With these basics we'll have the core of an actual game's play mechanics completed and all we'll need to do is add this to the world the characters live in.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec01"/>Gunplay as gameplay</h1></div></div></div><p>As our game is a shooter, one of the primary gameplay mechanics we need to provide is a mechanism through which guns can fire projectiles and hit other objects in the world. While there are many ways to accomplish gunfire in the game such as simulating the gunfire or creating game objects that represent projectiles, the more efficient mechanism to represent gunfire is a particle system. By attaching a particle system to our gun object, we can easily draw a representation of projectiles being fired at objects in the game world.<a id="id438" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Particle Systems in Unity support physics, collision, and memory management in a way that is particularly efficient for mobile devices. The only issue to watch for is that the fill rate (the rate at which the screen can be filled or drawn) for mobile devices is not as high as that of their desktop cousins. Similarly, if you perform actions such that the engine must redraw certain areas of the screen repetitively, you will see the same fill-rate issues. So if you have a lot of particles that are taking up large sections of the screen, you will likely have a performance issue. We will discuss this in much greater detail during the optimization chapter.<a id="id439" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec02"/>Time for action —  Readying the weapon</h1></div></div></div><p>For this example we will create a new project called gun range so that we can easily test our gameplay without having to build and deploy the entire project. Whenever you are making a large play mechanic change to your game, it is often useful to do this in isolation so that you can be more agile in your development. Large projects can get cluttered pretty quickly so it's best to test in simple projects:<a id="id440" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Create a new project called<strong> GunRange</strong>. Save the scene in the project as<strong> level_0</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Import a static gun model and put it in a hierarchy group called<strong> Weapons</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Next we need to ensure that the weapon is pointed along the Z-axis. We accomplish this by rotating the model so that the business end (that is, the end our projectiles will come out of) is pointed along the positive Z-axis.</li></ol></div><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_10_1.jpg" alt="Time for action — Readying the weapon"/></div><p>As we will attach this entire weapon and its gunfire particle system to the character as a prefab, we want to make sure that we define everything at this point relative to the coordinate system of the prefab. This is so that when it is attached to our character, or other object, it behaves properly.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec01"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>We just imported a gun model to our scene and aligned it to the Z-axis. We did this relative to the prefabs, coordinate system and not specifically to the game's coordinate system. We did this because we want projectiles being fired along the prefabs Z-axis regardless of what else is going on in the world's coordinate system.<a id="id441" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>It doesn't really matter which axis you align the weapon to (so long as you adjust your model and scripts), but it makes logical sense to align the weapon so that it is pointed down the Z-axis so that when we fire projectiles they are going down the positive Z. Why? In the traditional orientation for 3d graphics, movement along the positive Z-axis represents things moving away from the camera — so it makes sense to use that here.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec02"/>Firing projectiles</h2></div></div></div><p>We have two approaches that we can use to add a particle system to our weapon. We can either add it directly to our gun's Game Object or we can add a child Game Object to the gun that does the actual emitting. The approach you choose really depends on how much flexibility you need versus your desire to have more objects in the hierarchy.<a id="id442" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>If you add the particle system directly to the gun's Game Object, the particles will be emitted from the center of the Game Object and that would not be visually correct. The more universal case is to create a Game Object that will serve as the emission point and attach that to a point on the weapon. This is the approach we will use for our project.</p></div></div>

Since we set up our weapon so that it was pointing down the Z-axis, it is pretty easy to configure our particle system so that it will send the particles down the positive Z-axis as well.<a id="id447" class="indexterm"/><p>Remember that since we've made this particle emitter a child of our gun, we want to make sure that the coordinate system we define for it is relative to the origin of the gun model. You will need to adjust it from the gun model's origin to position it properly on the gun, but realize that the coordinate system for the <strong>MuzzlePoint</strong> is relative to that of the gun.

You may have to adjust this for your particular model, but you should make sure you start at the gun model's origin.<p>Since we are creating a particle system that represents bullets, we want to have all of our projectiles moving along the same axis. To accomplish this with an <strong>Ellipsoid Particle Emitter</strong>, we change the Ellipsoid for the emitter to only emit particles along one axis, the Z-axis in this case. If we didn't do this, we would have particles that would spray along random axes.

One certainly wouldn't want to hard code the frame of animation that the throw represents, as this is likely to change throughout the course of the game.
