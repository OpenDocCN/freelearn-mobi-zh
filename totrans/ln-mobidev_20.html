                    <h1 class="header-title">The Flyng Case Study</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Flyng is an iOS app and it is about dating but in a (slightly) different way. Let's have a look to see what the business and technical challenges for Flyng are. So far, this book has been full of a lot of theory. By now you know what the Lean start-up methodology is and, more specifically, how you can apply the methodology to mobile application development.</p>
<p>We have seen many samples for iOS, Android, and web apps, and we have learned what we need to do to learn from our users at an early stage and how to gather feedback quickly, all without too much (technical) effort.</p>
<p>Various providers offering their services have helped us with that. Think of a mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), such as Back4App and QuickBlox, onboarding instruments, such as social sign on and phone number sign on (digits), and analytics services.</p>
<p>The Lean start-up methodology is neither a religion nor an end unto itself. No way! It is just a good tool for creating apps that will matter and last. Do not waste your most precious resource (time!). Instead, use Lean methods to get feedback as early as possible. See if you can prove your hypothesis as early as possible. If you were right, proceed. If your hypothesis was proven wrong then learn and adapt. It is best to fail early and build a solution (a different feature, a better feature, or another app) that adds real value and that people actually want to use.</p>
<p>Earlier in the book, I promised you some real-world examples, and here is one. It is the case of Flyng, a new social app on which I am working together with my teammates. Later I will introduce them to you.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investigate what problem Flyng solves</li>
<li>Describe how the Flyng MVP was built</li>
<li>See what our Flyng hypotheses are</li>
<li>Review how the user feedback was measured</li>
<li>Discuss how the Flyng user base is built (the chicken and the egg)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Flyng case study summarizes most of what you have read in this book and covers what we did well and we did wrong. With that, this case study also has become a retrospective session for the team itself.</p>
<p>While building our Flyng MVP, we have already accomplished some great things. And, not surprisingly, we also learned that there are a couple of things we need to improve. We have been using the lean start-up methodology since we started the project, but despite that there are some things that we could have done better.</p>
<p>As you will read later in the chapter, one particular feature that we included was based on an assumption that we did not validate early enough. That particular feature is hardly used, but at least we discovered the problem early before we made many releases of the app. Other than that, Flyng is already a success and its user base is growing every day.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">That sounds awesome, but what is Flyng?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Flyng is an app that allows you to connect with students across your personal interests. Unlike Tinder, it is not just about dating. You can explore categories such as adventure, hookup, relationship, or party. In addition to other search criteria, it allows you to specify exactly what you like while browsing. It is this feature that attracts Flyng users the most:</p>

<p>The app also comes with other interesting features, such as the safety timer (but that is just an assumption) and, in the future, some interesting games.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The team</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The most important ingredient for any successful app is the team. It is the critical ingredient of a successful start-up and is something in which almost any VC is interested. Flyng, of course, has an awesome team. The Flyng team members are: Daniel Guthrie, Mitchell Trulli, and, not entirely coincidently, me (Mike).</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Mitchell Trulli</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Mitchell Trulli takes care of influencer marketing and branding, strategic partnerships, financing, and pitching. He has an MBA in finance (from Quinnipiac University) and dreams of working in the VC world after launching a successful start-up. He enjoys traveling and trading as well as spending his summers in Cape Cod.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Daniel Guthrie</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Daniel is in charge of monitoring the growth and analytics, social media strategy, branding, and running the ambassador program.</p>
<p>Danny and Mitchell are extremely passionate about start-ups and working on projects in the tech space. In addition, they are also extremely interested in the college market and learning and adapting marketing strategies to it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Mike van Drongelen</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Mike is the developer for the app and its backend. For now, the app is only available on iOS, but the Android app will be coming shortly. He is also interested in UX and everything else that matters to an app. Mike is a start-up addict too, but since you are reading this book I guess you already know that rather well.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The other contributors</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The team is larger than the core team. There are many other contributors and ambassadors! Take, for example, Kevin Dalvi. He helped the Flyng team with the UX and some great graphic designs.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank all of our beta testers and, last but certainly not least, the users of Flyng. They have made Flyng evolve to what it currently is. Without the effort of all these people, Flyng just would not exist.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The MVP</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>After Mitchell told me about his idea, I became quite enthusiastic and we quickly decided to create our first MVP. Looking at my own personal motivation, I can tell you that I always wanted to create a Tinder-style app and, since this solution was aiming at colleges, I was particularly interested in the concept.</p>
<p>Let me explain that last part a bit. My other start-up adventure, Teamspot, is an e-learning solution. It is a platform that lets companies meet students on all kinds of school levels and vice versa. It facilitates the whole organization around the setup and monitoring of internships.</p>
<p>I have always had a vision that learning should be fun and that it is so much more than just knowing and analyzing facts. It should also be about socializing, collaboration, and all kinds of other aspects that create a great experience. If you take away the fun, then the learning aspect will stop too. And if you are part of a start-up, you should always learn and have fun, at least once a day (maybe even twice).</p>
<p>That is why I am interested in Flyng. In addition, I thought it was a great opportunity to build an app the Lean way, so I could use it as a case study for this book. This is why you are reading about it now.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">A distributed team</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>While Mitchell and Daniel are in the US, I am in the Netherlands. That is not necessarily an issue. There are some great collaboration tools available and the fact that we are in different time zones just requires a little more planning. My co-author, Adam Dennis, is in another time zone as well. And that works great too.</p>
<p>Mitchell says this about our distributed team:</p>
<p>"Our team utilizes Slack to communicate daily; in addition we expect a weekly or bi-weekly Skype call. Working internationally has been made quite easy with the technology at our disposal; in addition Mike has been quite flexible with our hours."</p>
<p>Besides Slack, you can also use BaseCamp for your team communication. Both solutions work great for both distributed and local teams.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Flyng's USPs</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You might wonder: "Why another social/dating app? What makes Flyng so different?"</p>
<p>When I asked Mitchell, he told me:</p>
<p>"Tinder was previously hailed as the most profitable app of Q2 2017. We see the online dating market as still being extremely young and it is only growing."</p>
<p>To capitalize on the unique properties of Tinder (their swipeable profiles), and combine that with our unique spin on categories, we are able to innovate the space and attract users to our application and away from the standard Tinder or Bumble.</p>
<p>I believe that the ability to monitor the matches, and what categories they were matched with, is the most important part of our app. Our users will be particularly picky and will expect the entire app to revolve around these categories.</p>
<p>I also asked him why Flyng targets colleges in particular. Mitchell replied with:</p>
<div><em>"Many people do not understand why we target the college market as it has been hailed as one of the most difficult spaces to enter. We believe that our unique perspective on dating apps will allow us to stand out. In addition, our past projects have focused on the college market and we have learned extensively about how to promote and market to them."</em></div>
<p>The theory goes that every business has a (marketing) problem and a (technical) solution component. I asked Mitchell what the problems are that Flyng wants to solve?</p>
<p>Flyng solves the problem of people not being able to meet exactly who they want in their local area. Flyng allows them to meet people who are partying, younger or older, or in the same social organizations as them. This will greatly increase the amount of time spent off the phone and interacting in person. Our goal is to create personal bonds between people.</p>
<p>Other social apps, such as Facebook and Snapchat, fail to have an effective discovery platform; they are where you communicate with people after meeting in person. Tinder and Flyng allow you to meet people online so that you can interact with them offline.</p>
<p>In the future, we plan to add the ability to like photos, temporary categories, location-based categories, and other features that will increase the user engagement and retention.</p>
<p>The big milestone we are currently trying to reach is 40K <strong>Monthly Active Users</strong> (<strong>MAU</strong>). Once we are at this point, Kevin will lead a trip with Mitchell and Daniel and pitch to VCs in our network in the greater Silicon Valley area.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Growing a user base</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>40K monthly active users does not sound too complicated to accomplish. But like every start-up company, Flyng started with 0 users. So how did we get our user base to grow?</p>
<p>Mitchell outlines what we did quite well: We initially started with marketing before launching. We wanted to create a motion behind Flyng where people were actually waiting and excited to download the app prior to its launch.</p>
<p>This created our initial boost of 200-500 users on the first day to provide a base for our in-depth marketing strategies. Currently, we use social media and social influencers to grow Flyng's user base. Through growth hacking tactics and partnering with like-minded organizations, we are able to increase downloads and retain users.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is growing a user base in a specific area. Our social growth strategies are scattered and don't hyperfocus downloads in a specific geographical location like people want.</p>
<p>Dating and matching apps are always struggling to find a good balance between male and female. Most ideally it is balanced 50/50 but with many start-ups you see that early adopters are often male for some reason. It seems important for Flyng to do this well too.</p>
<p>Mitchell says: We are under the assumption that boys will chase girls. To capitalize on this we are marketing mainly to females, displaying that our categories will allow them to filter out the men they do not want to be linked with, something which no other apps allow.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The business model</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>An impressive user base is probably very convincing, but if we want Flyng to become a sustainable business, we better think about the business model too.</p>
<p>A blank business model canvas is staring at us. What will the business model canvas of Flyng look like? Let's do a short iteration through all elements of the canvas.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Customer segments</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Our users are college students. For now we are focusing on the Boston area. Later, we will scale up to the US and then, eventually, scale up to the world.</p>
<p>Our users are not necessarily our customers. If we know the sources of our revenue streams, then our customers could also be advertisers since they bring the money with them. On the other hand, the users add value to the app by spending a lot of time with it, something the advertisers love. Hmm, tricky. For now, let's add them both to the canvas.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Value propositions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>What value does Flyng add? In short, it provides category and story-driven people matching aimed at one particular vertical (colleges). The focus on this is important. Because we are dedicated to this particular vertical, we are in a position to actually create value. We know what needs our users have by aiming at this particular niche. I am sure you agree that this is a good strategy, assuming you know the history of Facebook. Rather than focusing on everyone, they began with the focus on university students. Your app may be in a total different space, but starting with a relatively small audience or solving a niche problem is always a good way to start.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Customer relationships</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>An online product, an app or a website for that matter, makes the relationship with your customers more anonymous. Still, there are ways to have a relationship with them, such as by providing feedback on Twitter, Instagram, and to App Store comments. It is important to let your users know that they are heard.</p>
<p>We also look at statistical information at Fabric Answers, Crashlytics, and the insights that iTunesConnect gives us.</p>
<p>It is too early to look at particular customer segments, but when we scale up it will certainly make sense to do so. Users in the U.S. and, for example, Asia, might express different behaviors and/or have different needs.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Channels</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Our (sales) channels are, as mentioned previously, social media and the App Store. In addition, we use push notification messages to notify users about app improvements and so on. If our user base is large enough, I expect that we will target specific segments to promote specific features.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Revenue Streams</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>From where does the revenue come? A buyout would be great, of course, but let's be realistic for now. So, where will we get our money? I think premium features are a good idea, but another option, according to Mitchell, could be:</p>
<p>Advertisements within a category, such as an ad for a beer company placed in the party category or endorsed category. For example, the party category could be sponsored by a beer company. Other categories could have sponsors as well.</p>
<p>In the app business, it is not difficult to reach the break-even level. As we will see later, our costs will be low. It is a totally different question as to whether Flyng will become a sustainable business. We will see what the future brings us. It is not our primary target yet. Growing the user base is the most important thing we need to do right now.</p>
<p>We have seen this in <a href="0efea3a6-95f2-42d3-9a36-a34bdbef1014.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chapter 17</a>, <em>Monetization and Pricing Strategy</em>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Key resources</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Our key resources, without doubt, are the App Store and the services we are using, such as Back4App to host the Parse Server. Our most precious resources are human: our team, and our users.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Key activities</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The key activity of Flyng basically comes down to matching people based on mutual interests and creating a perfect online experience.</p>
<p>By delivering that experience, Flyng is adding value. The app entertains users and brings people together, in real life, to enjoy the things they like to do most, whether it is dating, having the same hobby, or enjoying the same interests in sports.</p>
<p>Flyng is service oriented, so we are heavily investing in the relationship with our customers. We want them to know that they are heard and we care about their experience and the feedback they give. We use statistics to measure important KPIs, such as onboarding conversion, retention, and churning.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Partners</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Flyng needs to have partners just like any other business. If we want the app to get noticed, we need the help of others. Social influencers (such as a Twitter user with many followers) are our partners. Apple and the App Store is one. Our future advertisers, and/or the organizations that will purchase ads or sponsor categories, are also our partners.</p>
<p>That brings us to the question, "Who are our ambassadors or who could be our ambassadors?"</p>
<p>This was Mitchell's answer: It is tough to have brand ambassadors for a social app that is dating based. One idea would be to have a code for each city, similar to Flyng.us/boston, and split the pay-out among the local influencers. Another would be to create a custom code for each.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Cost structure</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>What are the costs that are involved with our app? Hosting (Back4App) and marketing are the only expenditures if we do not take the time that we have spend working on Flyng into account.</p>
<p>The more interaction there is on the platform, the more calls per second will be made against the backend. The party that is hosting the Parse Server, which is Back4App in our case, offers a number of plans. Each plan comes with a maximum number of monthly requests and a maximum number of requests per second. So, the more users the app has and, more importantly, the more concurrent users the app has, the more we need to pay for hosting:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="367" src="img/3eae3b5a-4325-40e0-93c1-72d60b99ee63.png" width="887"/></div>
<p>Our marketing costs depend on the platform and the frequency of our advertising. By carefully measuring our conversions, we can understand the correlation between our spending and the number of new users we secure.</p>
<p>When we started running campaigns, we noticed a large effect on the number of new users. We also learned that the effect lasted for only a short period of time. The preceding graph nicely illustrates this.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Unfair advantage</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This element appears in the sample business model canvas, but it is included with some variants. It is probably the toughest part of BMC. I asked Mitchell: What is Flyngs unfair advantage? In other words: What prevents another app builder from copying and rolling out the Flyng concept too?</p>
<p>Mitchell replied saying: Since the space is already crowded with a mix of both major market players (Tinder and Bumble) and an ample amount of small players, the most important thing for Flyng is our relationship and connection with our community/consumers in the space. Our unfair advantage will be our brand perception of leading to better connections and dates, as endorsed by our users and ourselves.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have now gathered all the information that we need. If we fill in Flyng's BMC, it will look like this:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="482" src="img/5a426bb7-1400-4080-bd29-86e70cbd74ec.png" width="467"/></div>
<p>And, since space is limited in a book, here is the right part of the canvas:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="553" src="img/7ad2ce52-703b-4352-bc07-bd7e95076a6b.png" width="497"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting feedback</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>So, we need evidence for our business model. What tools do we use to measure traction, retention, and other feedback? Feedback allows us to improve the app's features and prove whether our assumptions were right or wrong.</p>
<p>The feedback for our very first MVP came from direct interaction with our users.</p>
<p>If the number of users grows rapidly, we need to have some other tools to get proper feedback.</p>
<p>We gather our feedback from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>iTunesConnect analytical data</li>
<li>App store reviews</li>
<li>Fabric answers, analytical data</li>
<li>Fabric crashlytics, to measure, well, crashes</li>
<li>Back4App data and statistics</li>
<li>Feedback from our beta users</li>
</ul>
<p>The information that came with this feedback has taught us a lot about what features are being used the most. Most importantly, we noticed that the category-based browsing technology was something that was most appreciated by our users.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Unvalidated assumptions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When we started to build Flyng, we had a few hypotheses that our MVP proved were right. What assumptions did we have that were totally wrong?</p>
<p>Mitchell said: Through our MVP launch, we were able to see that almost no users utilized our safety feature, SAM. Sadly this will prompt us to remove it in the future and perhaps spin it off into its own project.</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="314" src="img/ce5b8072-531e-4ee5-a801-b1ddfc1e7b7f.png" width="177"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">A zombie feature</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>SAM is very easy to use, or, well, that is what we thought. Decide for yourself!</p>
<p>Say you met someone new on Flyng. Just to be safe, before you go out on your date, you use SAM to select 1 to 3 contacts from your contact book to alert if something goes wrong. You start the timer and every 45 minutes you need to check in just to let Flyng know that you are still OK. You just tap the (local) notification when it appears on your phone. If you do not respond or do not respond in time, your contacts will be notified through SMS.</p>
<p>Only a few people are really using the SAM feature. Apparently there are no creepy people at colleges (that is another assumption). Anyhow, we think this is a great concept, but if no one uses it then our users probably don't need it or at least they don't need it within Flyng.</p>
<p>The only zombie here is a great idea that risks becoming a member of the living dead:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="186" src="img/5dc56620-f60c-47fe-abe0-aa2307fbb4ce.png" width="184"/></div>
<p>Indeed, the feedback and statistics taught us that it is hardly used. We still need to research whether people do not think the option is useful, cannot find it, or think that it is too difficult for the assumed problem. This all needs further investigation.</p>
<p>For now, we can state that the hypothesis that people want to have a guardian when going on a date seems to be wrong. Just like Mitchell said, it probably needs to be removed and evolved to its own app. Of course, this idea assumes that the problem that this feature seeks to solve actually exists in a context other than Flyng.</p>
<p>And if not? Well, in that case this is a typical example of waste that could have been avoided by early validation. So, what could an even earlier MVP look like? Perhaps what we should have done is try to understand what problems girls (and boys?) currently face when going out a date using an online or real-world survey.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Feedback and actionable metrics</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The monitoring tools that we are using give us valuable analytical insights into our app. The challenge with these insights is how to convert them into actionable metrics.</p>
<p>Having some numbers is great, but how can you interpret them so that they become actionable metrics? And which KPIs really matter? Traction is a word that is often used, but how do you measure it? If you think traction is a number that defines to what extent people are actually using your app, then the number of users is a useful number. Or is it the number of active users? What is the definition of active user? Or, is the number of new users the important number here?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, you must make things measurable and be precise. You need to have clear goals.</p>
<p>Let's say that by the end of the year we want to have 100K new users. That is a clear target and, as long as it is a somewhat realistic target, it is a good one. In the end, real traction is proved by actual revenue, but in the case of Flyng, that is something for later.</p>
<p>Using the same tools we can also measure the retention rate. How many users are still using the app after 1 week, after 1 month, or after 1 year?</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" src="img/e67dceb7-6354-432c-92e3-fa05accdc6b8.png"/></div>
<p>If the retention rate is low, what do we need to do to make the users stay with the app? I asked Mitchell if we could say that the currently available analytics are actionable metrics. I also wondered if we needed additional resources or tools for measuring our users.</p>
<p>Mitchell says: "The current analytics we have are a good representation of the early market validation we have proved. Our marketing efforts have been inconsistent; the maximum number of days in a row that we have had an ad spend has been only 7 days so far.</p>
<p>We often monitor the feedback we get from social media, direct messages, comments on posts, and other user interactions to let us know whether our users' apps are crashing, what features they would like to see, and so on.</p>
<p>The most interesting feedback we have gotten was from users who have actually used the application and met with the people with whom they interacted. They told us that the categories allowed them to plan and interact differently. For example, the ones that met in the party category were able to link up at a party."</p>
<p>It is interesting to hear that our best feedback comes from direct interaction with our users. It should not be a real surprise, but it is important to know that direct feedback is a better resource than analytics alone:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" src="img/4a7284a9-c8ce-4ea4-8a7f-8f8f752312b3.png"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Split testing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>What features of Flyng could be perfect candidates for split testing purposes?</p>
<p>Mitchell says: Testing different types of categories would be ideal for split testing purposes. For example, to test the acceptance and interaction caused from the creation of a summer-related Beach Day category, we could create it in coastal locations that we deem strategic to our research testing.</p>
<p>Yes, I think it is worthwhile to run a few A/B experiments, not just for the app but for the App Store listing as well. Since <strong>App Store Optimization</strong> (<strong>ASO</strong>) techniques have recently become available, including App Store split testing, I would love to try them out to see how they work and if they can help us improve our app.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Vision</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You cannot have targets without a vision, so I wonder how ambitious the team is about Flyng. I asked Mitchell this: What do you think the future of Flyng will look like in, let's say, 1 year from now and in 3 years from now? Will Flyng be a sustainable business? Will it make some serious money? Will it have investors? Does it contribute in any other way business, wise or just for the society?</p>
<p>The dynamics of Flyng make it a great product to monetize. Category cards can be sponsored in multiple ways. First, an original category can be endorsed by a company. For example, the student athlete category could be sponsored by <a href="http://www.thetailgateseason.com">http://www.thetailgateseason.com</a>, a company in our network. A company that appears toward the top of the page would cost a premium, while lower ones would have the best value.</p>
<p>There could also be limited sponsored categories. These could be interactive to further embrace the value of learning about other profiles through their category line-up. For example, say Marvel is looking to advertise a new Avengers movie. We could run a sponsored, limited-duration category that acts like a poll. Users would pick their favorite superhero and could connect with similar fans. These ads would not be seen as intrusive and would add to the user experience if implemented with time and care.</p>
<p>Another benefit of having categories in our social meet-up app is using them to discriminate where to place ads. With traditional apps in our space, there is only one giant category. If Bud Light only wanted to advertise to people interested in and actively partying, these apps would not be able to cater to Bud Light. With Flyng's party category, we can present the ad to users who would be interested in their product. The ad would be relevant, which would make the user and Bud Light happy.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Technical considerations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since this book is most of all a practical approach to the Lean start-up methodology, we will have a look at the highlights of the Flyng technology as well. We cannot reveal too much, but just enough to give you an idea.</p>
<p>The app has been built for the iOS platform, but there are plans for an Android version too. The main reason for having an iOS-first strategy is because of the primary audience, colleges in the Boston area. If we had started the roll out in Europe, we probably would have had an Android first strategy instead.</p>
<p>The app is built with Swift 3.0 and will be migrated to Swift 4 in the future. It consumes data from a Parse Server, residing at Back4App. In addition, it uses QuickBlox for chat technology. The code has been structured in such a way that switching between one mBaaS and another is relatively easy.</p>
<p>Our technology stack includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xcode</li>
<li>Swift 4.0</li>
<li>Back4App, Parse server, PLQ, and Cloud code</li>
<li>Amazon</li>
<li>QuickBlox</li>
<li>Twillio</li>
<li>APNs, badges, messages for matches, and messages</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Parse server hosted at Back4App</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We have had to deal with some limitations using a Parse Server as a backend solution, but, on the other hand, it has also allowed us to develop the app rather quickly. This way we can focus on the frontend (the app) in particular.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a filter for the collection of matches, residing at Back4App:</p>
<div><img src="img/e29e9052-b338-4eb3-9308-2dcc9ccf1043.png"/></div>
<p>The app has been set up so that it will be easy to switch to another Parse Server or even to a custom-made backend API quickly.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Real-time data</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In addition to profile and media data, we also have a need for real-time data for the app's chat functionality.</p>
<p>We used to use parse live queries for the chat technology, but we found that QuickBlox was a more trustable service for these kinds of things. It was a bit tough to figure how to do the authentication for a single user for two different backend solutions, but in the end it was not really so hard to accomplish.</p>
<p>This is a sample of the QuickBlox dashboard. The service supports many other features, but we are just using it for chat functionality:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="409" src="img/639d1cd2-3dcd-4b71-af23-a1e81a137f41.png" width="593"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The other dependencies</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We use Twillio for sending text messages for the SAM feature. For onboarding, or the login/registration in particular, we ask the user to sign up with his/her Facebook account.</p>
<p>The onboarding for Flyng is tough if you do not have a Facebook account. You cannot continue until you login with a Facebook account. According to what we discussed in <a href="774e65d5-5ac0-4ade-9f9e-cffb2a911441.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Onboarding and Registration</em>, this means that we have a bit of a high barrier to overcome for onboarding.</p>
<p>Without knowing anything about the app, you need to sign-up, and if you do not have a Facebook account you go no further. While I do not want to recommend this strategy for all apps, it works great for a dating app like Flyng. For apps like these, it is important to avoid fake users and to avoid incomplete data. The data obtained from Facebook helps us to personalize the app, by showing your name and avatar, right after the sign-up.</p>
<p>We might need to offer other social sign-on options as well. Since the app is aiming at young people, we probably have to provide ways to sign up with a Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram account too.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to know that something else we did to avoid fake profiles is to use facial recognition technology. Using the iOS SDK, it is pretty easy to verify if one or multiple faces appear on an uploaded picture. When tested, we found out that it also differentiates a face from cartoons, animal pictures, and drawings. At the minimum, it prevents us from having profile avatars that show non relevant images, such as wallpapers, sunsets or even worse.</p>
<p>As you can see. we are using CocoaPods to add a few third-party dependencies, such as the Parse and QuickBlox SDK. As you can see, I am also using Facebook and Crashlytics as a reference:</p>
<pre>target 'flyng' do 
  use_frameworks! 
  pod 'Fabric' 
  pod 'Crashlytics'   
  pod 'Cartography'   
  pod 'Parse' 
  pod 'ParseFacebookUtilsV4' 
  pod 'ParseLiveQuery'  
  pod 'JSQMessagesViewController' 
  pod 'QuickBlox' 
 </pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Queries</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The data consumption relies on a few direct queries, but for the more complex requirements, cloud code solutions have been used. These cloud code solutions are JavaScript based and are closely related to the REST API functionality that is available with Parse Server.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity it is hosted at Back4App, but there is little that will prevent us hosting one or multiple Parse Servers in the future. Of course, in that case we need to handle push notifications, balancing and scaling, and other things too, but you get the picture. It allows us to be scalable if we need to scale right away.</p>
<p>When you look at the app's Swift code, you will notice that there are a number of methods defined for the client. They are available as protocol, which allows us to switch to another backend solution without too much effort.</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea, some of the available methods are shown here:</p>
<pre>import UIKit 
protocol RepositoryProtocol { 
    func authenticate (handler: RepositoryResultDelegate, request: AuthenticateRequest) 
    ... 
    func getProfile (handler: RepositoryResultDelegate, request: GetMyProfileRequest) 
    func getCategories (handler: RepositoryResultDelegate, request: GetCategoriesRequest) 
    func getCandidates (handler: RepositoryResultDelegate, request: GetCandidatesRequest) 
    func getMatchList (handler:RepositoryResultDelegate , request: GetMatchListRequest) 
    func pushMessage (handler: RepositoryResultDelegate, request: PushRequest)  
    ... 
} </pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Complex operations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>At first sight, it seems to be easy to figure out if there is a match between two people. But for an app, this is a complex operation. Imagine that you like a particular profile. First, we need to add that fact to your browsing history because you do not want to see profiles that you have already seen. We also will keep track of the people that you like. Later, when they like you too, this will result in a match. We want to create as many matches for our users as possible, so we need to make sure that you see the profiles of the people that did like you, first.</p>
<p>If you like someone, we need to run a query that informs us whether the person that you have just liked has also liked you previously. If so, a match entry will be added and we need to inform both you and your matching partner. Let's send a push notification to tell your partner and return the match that we have just created to inform you. Great, something new has happened. The badge, appearing on the app's icon (on the match tab), needs to be incremented. However, before we do this, we need to figure out how many new matches (and messages) there are, for both you and your partner. To make a long story short, this operation is a perfect candidate for a cloud-code-based solution.</p>
<p>The function, residing on the Parse Server, will do the heavy work for us. That makes sense, as the server has much more power, and this way we will also avoid sending too much data from the device to the server and vice versa. This is how we can keep things scalable.</p>
<p>From an app perspective, it is just a matter of providing the right data and consuming the result produced by the cloud function operated on the server. As an example, here is how the cloud function is called:</p>
<pre> func getCandidates (handler: RepositoryResultDelegate, request: GetCandidatesRequest){  
  let params =   
  [ 
            "myId": request.profileId, 
            "fromAge": myProfile.CriteriaAgeFrom, 
            "toAge" : myProfile.CriteriaAgeTo, 
            "gender" : myProfile.CriteriaGender, 
            "maxDistance" : myProfile.CriteriaMaxDistance, 
            "category": request.categoryId, 
            "skip": request.skip, 
            "limit" : request.limit 
     ] 
     PFCloud.callFunctionInBackground("getCandidates", withParameters:    
  params as [NSObject : AnyObject], block: { (object, error) in 
    ... </pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Push notifications</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In <a href="d9145149-0f4e-47b6-bc9d-ff46e5e63304.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chapter 15</a>, <em>Growing Traction and Improving Retention</em>, you will find more information about the implementation needed to show push notifications. For this case study, it is interesting to know that services such as Back4App (there are also Sashido and a couple of other ones) do not just allow you to host the Parse Server but also deal with the hassle of setting up push notifications for an app.</p>
<p>For our app, we use remote push notifications to show messages and to update the badge icon. We notify the user each time there is a new match or a new message. If this happens enough, the retention rate will grow just by itself. In addition, we also use local (scheduled) notifications for the SAM safety feature.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Crash reports</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We test each release candidate before we ship it, but a crash can always happen in the wild despite all our testing. If so, then Crashlytics comes to the rescue. It is easy to implement and it gives you a lot of insight (including a stack trace) on crashes:</p>
<pre>func application(application: UIApplication,           
     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -&gt; Bool {         
        ...         
        Fabric.with([Answers.self, Crashlytics.self]) </pre>
<p>In the following example, you can see how the number of crashes freely dropped to an unacceptable level. We localized the problem and released a new version. This resulted in the number of crash-free users to go up, nearly 99% or even higher. It is nearly impossible to satisfy everyone. The nature of your app and the OS it is running on can have a huge impact. For iOS, there are only a limited number of different devices and a high percentage of crash-free users certainly should be possible. Also, most devices will be using the latest version of iOS.</p>
<p>Note that this may be different for Android apps. You can expect that the percentage of crash-free users is lower for your Android app. This is because of the many different devices, flavors, and OS versions. There are devices with one/two/no cameras, for example. There are Android versions with Samsung or Huawei flavors, each doing things slightly differently. And it is not uncommon that you need to support Android version 4 to version 8. It is nearly impossible to test each variant. You have no other option than to focus on the top 10 popular devices and to hope it will work well on others as well:</p>
<div><img height="256" src="img/67e4ec90-c6fa-4cc1-a718-0dcbe58a76c3.png" width="557"/></div>
<p>We also use Fabric to measure how the app is used, for example to measure how many people signed up within a period of time:</p>
<pre>AnalyticsUtil.logEvent(AnalyticsUtil.eventSignupFacebook) 
 
static func logEvent(event: String){

<p>We did a couple of releases and many users gave the app 5 stars. Of course, we did get a few negative reviews as well. It is these users that we are most interested in. When you think about it, the negative reviewers are valuable because when they encountered a problem, they cared enough about the app to alert us about the problem. The challenge here is to turn this angry/unsatisfied customer into an ambassador. We can always try to start that conversion by making sure we listen to the user and solve the issue he/she is experiencing. Is there really a bug in the app? Is there something unexplained or unclear in the app? Let's contact the user to have a conversation to find out!</p>

<p>In this chapter, we provided an extensive case study that illustrated much of what is discussed in the book. We learned about the Flyng app, covering the things that we did well and did not do well. We have seen what the earliest assumptions were and how we gather feedback. It is important to prove your hypotheses as early as possible. It is important to properly validate them. If not, then it could result in a waste of time. That is what we saw happen with the SAM feature. Maybe it just needs a small pivot to make it a success, which will require some new experiments. These are all the things that perhaps could be applied to your app as well.</p>
<p>As of today, Flyng is still evolving. The adventure is ongoing and we continue to build, measure, and get feedback every day. Sometimes that is tough; but given the good spirit of the team, we will continue to move forward. I have no idea where this adventure is going, but I am sure about one thing. No matter whether it succeeds or fails, we are learning a lot, thanks to a whole pile of feedback, dedication, and, well maybe, a little bit of luck.</p>
<p>You can do that too! Stay focused. Do not procrastinate too often. Learn every day. Fail early. Sustain. Now, it is up to you! Good luck!</p>
