    banner impressions are 100 thousand, then your eCPM would be $20\. This means
    for every 1000 impressions, your average earnings would be $20\. You can then
    estimate your earnings; say your app receives 200 thousand impressions, then you'd

    revenue than simple impressions, so having a high click-through rate is ideal.
    If your click through rate is low, it could be due to the positioning of your
    banner not being easily accessible to users of your app. Make sure your banner
