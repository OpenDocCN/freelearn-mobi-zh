- en: Mobile applications have had a huge increase in popularity in the last few years
    and interest is still growing among users. Mobile operating systems are available
    not only for smart phones, but tablets as well, therefore increasing the possible
    market share for these applications.

- en: Android has characteristics that make it pleasant for developers such as open
    source and having a high level of community, driven development. Android has always
    been in competition with iOS (the Apple mobile system) in everything and with
    XCode, iOS presented itself as a more centralized development environment. The
    new Android Studio IDE makes this centralization finally available for Android
    developers and makes this tool indispensable for a good Android developer.
