    operators allow you to represent a range of values by specifying the start and
    end values for a range. You’ll learn about the different types of range operators.
    Loops allow you to repeat an instruction or a sequence of instructions over and
    over. You can repeat a sequence a fixed number of times or until a condition is
    met. You’ll learn about the different types of loops used to accomplish this.

    and use the different types of loops (`for-in`, `while`, and `repeat-while`).

    sends a discount voucher to customers between the ages of 18 and 30\. It would

    age. It’s much more convenient to use a range operator in this case.

    each month, a company will need to generate payroll slips for each employee. If
    the company has 10,000 employees, it would be inefficient to write 10,000 instructions
    to create the payroll slips. Repeating a single instruction 10,000 times would
    be better, and loops are used for this.
