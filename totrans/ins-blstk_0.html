This book has been especially created to provide you with all the information that you need to set up the BlueStacks suite of tools. You will learn the basics of BlueStacks App Player, learn how to synchronize the apps using Cloud Connect, and discover some tips and tricks for using these tools.</p><p>This book contains the following sections:</p><p><em>So, what is BlueStacks?</em> helps you find out about the BlueStacks suite of software tools, what you can do with them, and why they are so great.</p><p><em>Installation</em> covers how to download and install BlueStacks with ease and then set it up so that you can use Android apps as soon as possible.</p><p><em>Quick start – installing your first app</em> will show you how to get started with BlueStacks; installing and optimizing your system to run Android apps.

The following screenshot shows how it looks:</p><div><img src="img/9428OT_01_01.jpg" alt="So, what is BlueStacks?" width="1000" height="562"/></div><p>At the time of writing, there are two elements to the BlueStacks suite, which are listed as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>App Player</strong>: This is the engine, which runs the Android apps</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Cloud Connect</strong>: This is a synchronization tool</li></ul></div><p>As the BlueStacks tools can be freely downloaded, anyone with a PC running on Windows or Mac can download them and start experimenting with their capabilities. This book will walk you through the process of running BlueStacks on a computer and show you some of the ways in which you can make the most out of this emerging technology. There are other ways by which you can run an emulator of Android on your computer. You can, for instance, run a virtual machine or install the Android <strong>Software Development Kit</strong> (<strong>SDK</strong>). These assume a degree of technical understanding that isn't necessarily required with BlueStacks, making BlueStacks the quickest and easiest way of running apps on your computer.</p><p>BlueStacks is particularly interesting for users of Windows 8 tablets, as it opens up a whole library of mature software designed for a touch interface. This is particularly useful for those wanting to use many, free, or cheap Android apps on their laptop or tablet.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>It is worth noting that, at the time of writing this book, these tools are beta releases, so it is important that you take time to report the bugs that you may find to the developers through their website. The ongoing development and success of the software depends upon this feedback and results in a better product. If you become reliant on a particular feature, it is a good idea to highlight your love to the developers too. This can help influence which features are to be kept and improved upon as the product matures.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec03"/>App Player</h2></div></div></div><p>BlueStacks App Player allows a Windows or Mac user to run Android apps on his or her desktop or laptop. It does this by running an emulated version of Android within a window that you can interact with using your keyboard and mouse. The App Player can be downloaded and installed for free from the BlueStacks website, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bluestacks.com">http://www.bluestacks.com</a>. Currently, there are two main versions available for different operating systems:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Mac OS X</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8</li></ul></div><p>Once you have installed the software, an Android emulator runs on your machine. This is a light version of Android that can access app stores so that you can download and run free and paid apps and content. Most apps are compatible with App Player; however, there are some that are not (for technical reasons) and some that have been prevented by the App developers from running.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>If you are running any another operating system on your computer, the more computing power you can make available to the App Player the better. Otherwise, you might experience slow loading apps or worse still ones that do not function properly.</p><p>To increase your chances of success, first try running App Player without running any other applications (for example, Word).</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec04"/>Cloud Connect</h2></div></div></div><p>Cloud Connect provides a means to synchronize the apps running on an existing phone or tablet with the App Player. This means that you do not have to manually install lots of apps. Instead, you install an app on your device and sign up so that your App Player has exactly the same apps as your device.</p></div></div></div></div>
