    objects that are not visible in the camera area in order to improve optimization.
    This primarily means that the objects will not be using resources, only when necessary,
    with the result that of helping you create a game or app that will work much faster.

    renderers that are outside the view of the camera, but does not disable the renderers
    that overlap other renderers; for example, if a wall hides an object, it will
    be invisible for the camera. Using occlusion culling, you can automatically take
    the advantage of frustum culling. With the usage of visual occlusion culling technique,
    we can see in two examples as shown in the following screenshots:'

    the entire scene and create a hierarchy of potentially visible sets of objects.
    Then, this information will be used by other cameras in your game or in your application
    in real time, in order to reduce the number of draw calls and to improve your
    performance.

    for each object in the scene to be processed by this optimization mechanism. Also,
    you can use another object's tag, which is called **Occludee Static** as shown
    in the next screenshot. Occludees may be obscured by other objects and will be
    disabled in a similar situation to improve performance, but these objects cannot
    overlap other objects. Therefore, they will increase the performance of your entire
    project.

    approach. We cannot describe all the details of the settings and features in this
    chapter. The following sections describe the various ideas, methods, approaches,
    and ways to optimize and improve performance. The purpose of the next section
    is to direct you on the right path to improve performance. You will use the desired
    optimization techniques from this chapter, and if it is necessary, you can find
    more detailed information about methods, implementations, and customizations from
    the web. Let's now consider another optimization technique known as **Level Of
    Detail** (**LOD**).

- en: Optimizing by LOD
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The LOD optimization technique is a method of reducing the complexity of frame
    rendering by reducing the total number of polygons, textures, and other resources
    in the scene, the general decline in its complexity. A simple example is that
    the main character model consists of 10,000 polygons. In cases where the treated
    stage is located close to the camera, it is important to use all the polygons.
    However, at a great distance from the camera, in the final image, it will take
    only a few pixels; there is no sense in handling all 10,000 polygons. Perhaps,
    in this case, it would be enough for hundreds of polygons, or even a couple of
    pieces and textures, specially prepared for about the same display model. Accordingly,
    at intermediate distances, it makes sense to use a model consisting of a number
    of triangles greater than the simplest model and smaller than the most complex.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The LOD method is commonly used for modeling and rendering three-dimensional
    scenes using multiple difficulty levels (geometric or some other) for the objects
    in proportion to their distance from the camera. Changing complexity, particularly
    in the number of triangles in the model may be performed automatically, is based
    on a three-dimensional model of highest complexity, but can be on the basis of
    several predefined patterns with different levels of detail. Using a model with
    less detail for different distances, you will reduce rendering design complexity,
    almost without compromising the overall image detail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The method is particularly effective when the number of objects in the scene
    is large, and they are located at different distances from the camera. For example,
    consider a sports game, such as football game or a hockey simulator. Low-poly
    character models are used when they are away from the camera, but when it approaches,
    the models are replaced by a large number of polygons. This example is very simple,
    and it shows that the essence of the method is based on two levels of detail of
    the model, but no one bothers to create multiple levels of detail. In order to
    effect change, the LOD level was not too obvious, so the object detail gradually
    grows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Consider the following factors that have an effect on the level of detail technique:
    the total number of objects on the screen (when one or two characters in the frame,
    use complex models, and when 10–20, they are switched to a simpler model) or the
    FPS (predetermined limited values of the FPS, which varies with the level of detail,
    such as FPS below 30 reduces the complexity of the models on the screen, while
    60 FPS raises the complexity). Other possible factors that affect the level of
    detail are as follows: the speed of movement of the object (in case of a rocket
    in motion you see it moving fast, but a snail moves slowly), the importance of
    a character from the game''s point of view (for example, in football, the player
    models you see the closest and most often uses more complex geometry and texture).
    It all depends on the desires and capabilities of a particular developer. The
    main thing is to not overdo it; frequent and noticeable changes in the level of
    detail will be annoying.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'We want to remind you that the level of detail does not necessarily refer only
    to the geometry. The method can also be used to save other resources: texturing
    (although GPUs use mipmapping, sometimes it makes sense to change the texture
    on the fly on the other with some detail), lighting technician (close objects
    covered by a complex algorithm, and distant objects covered by a prime), and texturing
    techniques.'

- en: 'We also want to mention the other techniques to optimize your code. One of
    them is the technique of caching components or variables. During optimization,
    you first need to turn your attention to the functions that are very often performed
    in your code, especially callbacks such as `Update` and `FixedUpdate` and similar
    functions that are called in every frame, or almost each frame, or in other words,
    many times per second. Therefore, reference to any component or variable in such
    risky functions depends on the situation. Of course, there are situations for
    the overall system performance, where such things are not so bad for your performance
    in general, and there are situations where performance drops almost to zero because
    of the many unnecessary expenses. In such functions, it is best not to call the
    Unity method `GetComponent` each time, which will very often look for a component
    or other similar functions of the Unity library to find objects and so on. Instead,
    you can call the function you want, when it is necessary to obtain a desired component
    or desired object(s) and store them in local variables or arrays, as you like.
    The following examples demonstrate this:'

    optimization is shown in the following example, but this example is not the best

    in which none of the cameras can see (for `OnBecameInvisible`) or at least one
    camera sees (for `OnBecameVisible`) your renderer. Certainly, these callbacks
    are only good in certain situations and not in others. For example, if your object
    does not contain a renderer component, then you will need to invent a way to enable

    optimization in most cases impedes readability and therefore impedes understanding
    of the code. Keep this in mind, or at least do not forget about it. Like everything

- en: Let's see how static functions behave and how much time we need for them, since
    the use of these functions significantly reduces the time of the function call
    as compared to call a non-static function. If we examine the question of what
    happens with static functions when you compile your code, it is, however, no secret
    that all the code is translated into machine code or assembler as it is called,
    which is the lowest programming level. If we consider the very assembly instructions
    to call static functions, we see that it requires fewer machine instructions and
    consequently less CPU time than calling a nonstatic function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the call, each function with parameters passed by value requires memory duplication.
    As discussed earlier in text, this may impair your performance. Therefore, it
    is better to call a function with parameters passed by reference rather than by
    value. It is easy to bypass this problem. The best thing for enhancing your performance
    is to use local variables of a class or object that is used in the function. You
    can create a set of variables within a function, which in turn will significantly
    increase the consumption of memory and CPU time of the function call with a lot
    of variables. The function must be remembered in the stack for further opportunities
    to work with these variables. Even if these variables are not used in the function,
    they are still in the stack and they will occupy memory space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The following discussion focuses on the constants. Constants do not require
    RAM allocation, since their values are directly sewed in the instruction stream.
    Using constants instead of creating a large number of local or global variables
    can significantly accelerate the performance of your software, avoiding the overhead
    of memory and CPU time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Static variables (variables of a class) as well as static functions (methods
    of a class) require less CPU time, since static variables belong to the whole
    class, rather than to an object of this class. The time spent on searching for
    supplies is declining, which has obvious advantages in optimization. For variables
    or functions of any object machine, instructions will be executed to locate the
    appropriate object to which they belong, which obviously require the overhead
    of CPU time and memory.

- en: 'The `if` and `switch` statements can be easily changed for each other; for
    example, to increase the understanding and readability of the code or to optimize
    all the same code. If you look at the postcompilation machine instructions and
    directions through any disassembler, you can see the difference between these
    two expressions. The `switch` statement**,** for example, after compiling becomes
    ago-to mechanism, which in turn makes jumping through machine instructions in
    its transition table. It needs to find the desired transition in the first place,
    and then those going to the command assembly. If construction behaves low bit
    differently, it turns normal branching as in high-level programming language;
    for example, in our case, the C# language. In some cases, some `switch` design
    may be executed faster than the same `if`/`else if`/`else` design. Performance
    of these two structures solely depends on their correct application or in other
    words the correct use. For example, let''s consider two simple cases, where in
    the first case will be quicker and faster `switch`, and in the second situation

    we saw that in different situations the `if` and `switch` designs, which at first
    sight are absolutely equivalent, may differ in speed and efficiency with respect
    to performance. We also saw that different situations give a performance advantage
    with different designs, although they have the same semantics, or in other words,
    the same algorithm designed in different forms. However, the meaning does not

- en: As for the characters, it is better to use a single character than a string
    consisting of a single character. A symbol is passed by value, and it is necessary
    and requires only two bytes of memory, while the string with one character requires
    more than 20 bytes of memory, since the string is passed by reference.

    when necessary, otherwise you risk degrading your performance. For example, using
    this function for characters is not always exact: there is rarely a decision justified.
    Generally, you should remember one simple and most important axiom of code optimization—with
    less code executed, less CPU time and memory is used that significantly improves
    your productivity. Let''s look at a simple code example shown here, which covers
    one of the simplest options for optimizing the transfer of an integer to a string:'

    examples. In optimization, you should often trust your own instincts to find the
    cause of all ills, but to make the right decisions you need to rely on the results
    of the tests, that is, just pure mathematics and well-defined numbers.
