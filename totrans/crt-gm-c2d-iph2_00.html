It is powerful, flexible, and best of all it is free to use for your own projects. Thousands of apps, including many top selling games, have been written using cocos2d.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Creating Games with cocos2d for iPhone 2</em></span> will take you on a tour of nine very different games, guiding you through the designing process and code needed to build each game. All of the games were specifically selected to highlight different approaches to solving the challenges inherent in designing a game.</p><p>The games covered in this book are all classic game styles. By focusing on games you probably already know, you can see how everything works "under the hood" with cocos2d.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Thanks for the Memory Game">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Thanks for the Memory Game</em></span>, covers the design and building of a memory tile game. It covers basic concepts such as grid layouts, using cocos2d actions, and using CocosDenshion for sound effects.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Match 3 and Recursive Methods">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Match 3 and Recursive Methods</em></span>, walks through the design and building of a match-3 game. This chapter covers two different approaches to checking for matches, as well as an extensive section on predictive matching and how to generate artificial randomness.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Thumping Moles for Fun">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Thumping Moles for Fun</em></span>, provides the basic concepts of how to design a mole thumping game. This game uses Z-ordering to "trick the eye", and uses cocos2d actions extensively to give a very polished game with very little coding needed.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Give a Snake a Snack…">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Give a Snake a Snack...</em></span>, follows the design and building of a snake game. Some of the topics covered in this chapter include overriding methods, making sprites follow each other, and implementing increasing difficulty levels.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Brick Breaking Balls with Box2D">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Brick Breaking Balls with Box2D</em></span>, covers the building of a brick-breaking game using the Box2D physics engine. In this chapter, you will find a basic primer on how to use Box2D, using plists to store level data, and implementing power-ups.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Cycles of Light">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Cycles of Light</em></span>, takes us to an iPad only multiplayer game. This game allows two players to compete head-to-head on the same iPad, or by using GameKit's Bluetooth connectivity to play against each other on two iPads. This chapter also walks through how we can use a single pixel to draw almost everything in the game.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Playing Pool, Old School">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Playing Pool, Old School</em></span>, revisits the Box2D physics engine to build a top-down pool game. The focus on this chapter is to implement a simple "rules engine" into the game, as well as how to easily build multiple control methods into the same game.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Shoot, Scroll, Shoot Again">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Shoot, Scroll, Shoot Again</em></span>, walks through the building of a top-down scrolling shooter. This chapter walks you through how to use readily available outside tools and resources, including Sneaky Joystick and the Tiled tile map editor. It also covers two different forms of enemy AI, including A* Pathfinding.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Running and Running and Running...">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Running and Running and Running...</em></span>, brings us to the most ambitious game of all, the endless runner. The primary topics covered are how to create random terrain that characters can walk on, parallax scrolling backgrounds, and implementing a lot of different types of enemies.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>The book and code bundle contain the complete source code you will need to run all nine games. You will only need a few items to run the games:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An Intel-based Macintosh running OS X Lion (or later)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Xcode version 4.5 (or higher)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">To run any games on a real device (iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch), you will need to be enrolled in the Apple's iOS Developer program. You will be able to run the games in the iOS Simulator without enrolling, but the tilt controls in <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Shoot, Scroll, Shoot Again">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Shoot, Scroll, Shoot Again</em></span> and the Bluetooth multiplayer mode in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Cycles of Light">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Cycles of Light</em></span> will only work on a real iOS device.</li></ul></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is written for people who have basic experience with cocos2d, but want some guidance on how to approach real-world design issues. Although the book does revisit some basic concepts, we hit the ground running, so having a basic understanding of cocos2d is recommended. At least some knowledge of Objective-C is also strongly recommended.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the <code class="literal">include</code> directive."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">-(void) makeTransition:(ccTime)dt
{
  [[CCDirector sharedDirector] replaceScene:
     [CCTransitionFade transitionWithDuration:1.0
        scene:[MTMenuScene scene] withColor:ccWHITE]];
}</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">-(void) makeTransition:(ccTime)dt

} </pre></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>New terms</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>important words</strong></span> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> button moves you to the next screen".</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
