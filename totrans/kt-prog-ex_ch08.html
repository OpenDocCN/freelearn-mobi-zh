<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Over the past six chapters, we have explored the application of Kotlin in the mobile app domain by focusing on Android development. The last chapter explored the various storage mediums provisioned by the Android application framework to the application development. We explored internal storage, external storage, network storage, and SQLite; we also created programs that utilized them. We went a step further by covering the use of Room and content providers to store and retrieve data from a SQLite database.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In this chapter, we willl wrap up our exploration of Android by covering two extremely important topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Android application security</span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Android application deployment</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We will kick off this chapter by discussing Android application security.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It should come as no surprise that security is an important consideration when building software. Besides the security measures put in place in the Android operating system, it is important that developers pay extra attention to ensuring that their applications meet the set security standards. In this section, a number of important security considerations and best practices will be broken down for your understanding. Following these best practices will make your applications less vulnerable to malicious programs that may be installed on a client device.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As we saw in the previous chapter, internal storage is a good way to save private data on a device. Every Android application has a corresponding internal storage directory in which private files can be created and written to. These files are private to the creating application, and as such cannot be accessed by other applications on the client device. As a rule of thumb, if data should only be accessible by your application and it is reasonably possible to store it in internal storage, do so. Feel free to refer to the previous chapter for a refresher on how to use internal storage.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">External storage files are not private to applications, and, as such, can be easily accessed by other applications on the same client device. As a result of this, you should consider encrypting application data before storing it in external storage. There are a number of libraries and packages that can be used to encrypt data prior to its saving to external storage. Facebook's Conceal (<a href="http://facebook.github.io/conceal/">http://facebook.github.io/conceal/</a>) library is a good option for external-storage data encryption.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to this, as another rule of thumb, do not store sensitive data in external storage. This is because external storage files can be manipulated freely. Validation should also be performed on input retrieved from external storage. This validation should be done as a result of the untrustworthy nature of data stored in external storage.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As you know from the previous chapter, content providers can either prevent or enable external access to your application data. Use the <kbd>android:exported</kbd> attribute when registering your content provider in the manifest file to specify whether external access to the content provider should be permitted. Set <kbd>android:exported</kbd> to <kbd>true</kbd> if you wish the content provider to be exported, otherwise set the attribute to <kbd>false</kbd>.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to this, content provider query methods—for example, <kbd>query()</kbd>, <kbd>update()</kbd>, and <kbd>delete()</kbd>—should be used to prevent SQL injection (a code injection technique that involves the execution of malicious SQL statements in an entry field by an attacker).</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There are a number of best practices that should be followed when performing network transactions via an Android application. These best practices can be split into different categories. We shall speak about&#160;<strong>Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong>IP</strong>) networking and telephony networking best practices in this section.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When communicating with a remote computer via IP, it is important to ensure that your application makes use of HTTPs wherever possible (thus wherever it is supported in the server). One major reason for doing this is because devices often connect to insecure networks, such as public wireless connections. HTTPs ensure encrypted communication between clients and servers, regardless of the network they are connected to. In Java, an <kbd>HttpsURLConnection</kbd> can be used for secure data transfer over a network. It is important to note that data received via an insecure network connection should not be trusted.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In instances where data needs to be transferred freely across a server and client applications, <strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging</strong> (<strong>FCM</strong>)—along with IP networking—should be utilized instead of other means, such as the <strong>Short Messaging Service</strong> (<strong>SMS</strong>) protocol. FCM is a multi-platform messaging solution that facilitates the seamless and reliable transfer of messages between applications.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">SMS is not a good candidate for transferring data messages, because:</span></p>
<ul class="ol1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">It is not encrypted</span></li>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The validation of user input is extremely important in order to avoid security risks that may arise. One such risk, as explained in the <em>Using content providers</em> section, is SQL injection. The malicious injection of SQL script can be prevented by the use of parameterized queries and the extensive sanitation of inputs used in raw SQL queries.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to this, inputs retrieved from external storage must be appropriately validated because external storage is not a trusted data source.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The risk of phishing can be alleviated by reducing the requirement of user credential input in an application. Instead of constantly requesting user credentials, consider using an authorization token. Eliminate the need for storing usernames and passwords on the device. Instead, make use of a refreshable authorization token.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before publishing an Android application, it is imperative to utilize a code obfuscation tool, such as <strong>ProGuard</strong>, to prevent individuals from getting unhindered access to your source code by utilizing various means, such as decompilation. ProGuard is prepackaged included within the Android SDK, and, as such, no dependency inclusion is required. It is automatically included in the build process if you specify your build type to be a release. You can find out more about ProGuard here: <a href="https://www.guardsquare.com/en/proguard"><span class="s3">https://www.guardsquare.com/en/proguard</span></a> .</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By default, a broadcast receiver component is exported and as a result can be invoked by other applications on the same device. You can control access of applications to your apps's broadcast receiver by applying security permissions to it. Permissions can be set for broadcast receivers in an application's manifest file with the <kbd>&lt;receiver&gt;</kbd> element.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In scenarios in which the dynamic loading of code by your application is necessary, you must ensure that the code being loaded comes from a trusted source. In addition to this, you must make sure to reduce the risk of tampering code at all costs. Loading and executing code that has been tampered with is a huge security threat. When code is being loaded from a remote server, ensure it is transferred over a secure, encrypted network. Keep in mind that code that is dynamically loaded runs with the same security permissions as your application (the permissions you defined in your application's manifest file).</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlike broadcast receivers, services are not exported by the Android system by default. The default exportation of a service only happens when an intent filter is added to the declaration of a service in the manifest file. The <kbd>android:exported</kbd> attribute should be used to ensure services are exported only when you want them to be. Set <kbd>android:exported</kbd> to <kbd>true</kbd> when you want a service to be exported and <kbd>false</kbd> otherwise.</span></p>

This has a number of advantages, such as increasing the potential market size of your product, reducing the barrier of access to your product, and maximizing the number of potential installations of your application. Releasing on numerous platforms simultaneously is generally a good idea. If you wish to do this with any product of yours, ensure you plan for this well in advance. In cases where it is not possible to launch an application on multiple platforms at once, ensure you provide a means by which interested potential users can submit their contact details so as to ensure that you can get in touch with them once your product is available on their platform of choice.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This step involves the collation of all resources necessary for your product's Play Store listing. These resources include, but are not limited to, your application's log, screenshots, descriptions, promotional graphics, and videos, if any. Ensure you include a link to your application's privacy policy along with your application's Play Store listing. It is also important to localize your application's product listing to all languages that your application supports.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As testing is an efficient and battle-tested way of detecting defects in software and improving software quality, it is a good idea to upload your application package to alpha and beta channels to facilitate carrying out alpha and beta software testing on your product. Alpha testing and beta testing are both types of acceptance testing.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you have catered for the necessary steps prior to this, you are ready to publish your application to the production channel of the Play Store. Firstly, you will need to roll out a release. A release allows you to upload the APK files of your application and roll out your application to a specific track. At the end of the release procedure, you can publish your application by clicking <span class="packt_screen">Confirm rollout</span>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, that was all we need to know to publish a new application on the Play Store. In most cases, you will not need to follow all these steps in a linear manner, you will just need to follow a subset of the steps—more specifically, those pertaining to the type of application you wish to publish. As always, the best way to understand a set of steps is through an example. Let's go ahead and publish an application we developed in a previous chapter. We will publish the Messenger application to the Play Store in the following section. You may choose to publish any of the applications we previously developed if you prefer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first thing we will do in order to publish the Messenger app to the Play Store is create a Google Play Developer Account. Doing this is simple. We will show you how in the following paragraphs. First and foremost, choose your favorite web browser and navigate to the following URL: <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup"><span class="s2">https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup</span></a> .</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once you open the web page, you will be asked to sign in with your Google account. After signing in with an appropriate Google account, you will be required to accept the developer program agreement. This second step is shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/a3d90fe5-bf8f-4718-9ad7-2be24a1282b8.jpg"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Accept the Google Play Developer agreement by scrolling to the bottom of the web page, as shown in the following screenshot, and ticking <span class="packt_screen">I agree and I am willing to associate my account registration with the Google Play Developer distribution agreement</span></span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/0710f6bb-fcbe-4c00-9e37-405c5af46f4d.jpg"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After accepting the agreement, click <span class="packt_screen">CONTINUE TO PAYMENT</span>&#160;to proceed with your developer account creation. You are required to pay a one-time Google Play Developer Account registration fee of $25. You will be taken through a hassle-free payment process. Once payment has been successfully made, you will be prompted accordingly:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/58c62158-f3e2-437b-aee7-4587cdeadaf9.jpg"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Clicking <span class="packt_screen">CONTINUE REGISTRATION</span> will take you to the final step of the registration process where you will be asked to complete your account details, as follows:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/6dea7f12-5b63-4abf-8acc-b4db2dea009b.jpg"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enter the rest of your account details as required and click <span class="packt_screen">COMPLETE REGISTRATION</span> to finish the account registration process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Upon completing registration, you will be directed to the Google Play Developer Console. From here, you can manage your applications, use Google Play game services, manage your orders, download application reports, view alerts, and manage your console settings:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/59bb2082-06bb-447d-8d68-d5c28fbfed72.jpg"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are interested in publishing an Android application. As such, click <span class="packt_screen">PUBLISH AN ANDROID APP ON GOOGLE PLAY</span> on the console dashboard. Select a default language and input <kbd>Messenger</kbd> as the app's title when requested to then click <span><span class="packt_screen">CREATE</span></span>. A new draft application will be created for you on the Developer console:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before proceeding with our application publication process, we must sign a release APK for the Messenger app.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Signing your application for release</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Open your Messenger app project in Android Studio. Though not the only method of signing apps, Android Studio will be used in this chapter to sign the Messenger App. First things first, generate a private key for signing by running the following command in your Android Studio terminal:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias my-alias</span></strong></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Running the preceding command prompts you to input a <kbd>keystore</kbd> password as well as to provide additional information for your key. The <kbd>keystore</kbd>&#160;is then generated as a file called <kbd>my-release-key.jks</kbd> and saved in the current directory. The key contained in the keystone is valid for 10,000 days.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that we have generated a private key, we will configure Gradle to sign our APK. Open the module-level <kbd>build.gradle</kbd> file and add a <kbd>signingConfigs {}</kbd> block—within the <kbd>android {}</kbd> block—with entries for <kbd>storeFile</kbd>, <kbd>storePassword</kbd>, <kbd>keyAlias</kbd>, and <kbd>keyPassword</kbd>. Once that has been done, pass that object to the <kbd>signingConfig</kbd> property in your app's release build type. Take the following snippet as an example:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">android {</span><span class="s1"><br/>  compileSdkVersion 26 <br/>  buildToolsVersion "26.0.2"<br/>  defaultConfig {<br/>     applicationId "com.example.messenger"<br/>     minSdkVersion 16<br/>     targetSdkVersion 26<br/>     versionCode 1<br/>     versionName "1.0"<br/>     testInstrumentationRunner "android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"<br/>     vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true<br/>  }<br/><br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>signingConfigs {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>release {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>storeFile file("../my-release-key.jks")<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>storePassword "password"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>keyAlias "my-alias"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>keyPassword "password"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>buildTypes {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>release {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      minifyEnabled false<br/></span>      proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>signingConfig signingConfigs.release<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After doing the preceding, you are ready to sign your APK; before we do this, we must modify our current package name. The <kbd>com.example</kbd>&#160;package name is restricted by Google Play, and, as such, we must change our package name before we attempt to publish our application to the Play Store. Don't fret: changing the name of our app's root package is easy with Android Studio. Firstly, ensure you have set Android Studio to show the project directory structure. This can be done by clicking the dropdown toward the top left of the IDE window and selecting <span class="packt_screen">Project</span></span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/5379c8a2-76a5-449a-8518-1799bd05528f.jpg" style="width:23.33em;height:26.83em;"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you have done the preceding, unhide all empty middle packages in the project structure view by deselecting the <span class="packt_screen">Hide Empty Middle Packages</span> option in the project structure settings menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/5bf41a17-aced-4367-a8a4-6d9b642d6e06.jpg" style="width:37.08em;height:30.00em;"/></div>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After deselecting the preceding option, empty middle packages will no longer be hidden, and, as such, <kbd>com.example.messenger</kbd>&#160;will be split into three visible packages: <kbd>com</kbd>, <kbd>example</kbd>, and <kbd>messenger</kbd>. Let's rename the <kbd>example</kbd> package to something else. Change <kbd>example</kbd> to a name obtained from the combination of your first and last names. So, if your first name and surname are Kevin Fakande, the package name will be renamed from <kbd>example</kbd> to <kbd>kevinfakande</kbd>. A package can be renamed by right-clicking on it and selecting <span class="packt_screen">Refactor&#160;</span>| <span class="packt_screen">Rename...</span></span>. <span class="s1">After your package has been renamed, check your manifest and <kbd>build.gradle</kbd> files to ensure that the modification to your project's package if reflected. Thus, wherever you see the <kbd>com.example.messenger</kbd> string in your <kbd>build.gradle</kbd> or manifest files, modify it to <kbd>com.{full_name}.messenger</kbd>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having made the preceding changes, you are ready to sign your application. Type the following command in your Android Studio terminal:</span></p>
</div>
<pre class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">./gradlew assembleRelease</span></strong></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Running the preceding command creates a release APK that has been signed with your private key in the <kbd>&lt;project_name&gt;/&lt;module_name&gt;/build/outputs/apk/release</kbd> path.&#160;The APK will be named as <kbd>&lt;module_name&gt;-release.apk</kbd>. As our module in this project is named <kbd>app</kbd>, the APK in this case will be named <kbd>app-release.apk</kbd>. APKs that have been signed with a private key are ready for distribution. Having signed our APK, we are ready to finish the publication of the Messenger app.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having signed your Messenger application, you can proceed with completing the required application details toward the goal of releasing your app. Firstly, you need to create a suitable store listing for the application. Open the Messenger app in the Google Play Console and navigate to the store-listing page (this can be done by selecting <span class="packt_screen">Store Listing</span> on the side navigation bar).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You will need to fill out all the required information in the store listing page before we proceed further. This information includes product details, such as a title, short description, full description, as well as graphic assets and categorization information—including the application type, category and content rating, contact details, and privacy policy. The Google Play Console store listing page is shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/4205bafa-ab12-4575-885c-0fa3c4995516.jpg"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once the store listing information has been filled in, the next thing to fill in is the pricing and distribution information. Select <span class="packt_screen">Pricing &amp; distribution</span> on the left navigation bar to open up its preference selection page. For the sake of this demonstration, we set the pricing of this app to <span class="packt_screen">FREE</span>. We also selected five random countries to distribute this application to. These countries are Nigeria, India, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Australia:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/0da054ff-d685-4f18-b77a-d84ba072a48a.jpg"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides selecting the type of pricing and the available countries for product distribution, you will need to provide additional preference information. The necessary information to be provided includes device category information, user program information, and consent information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is now time to add our signed APK to our Google Play Console app. Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">App releases&#160;</span>| <span class="packt_screen">MANAGE BETA</span> | <span class="packt_screen">EDIT RELEASE</span>. In the page that is presented to you, you may be asked whether you want to opt into Google play app signing:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/61625732-593e-4602-9efc-00bdcca58777.jpg"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the sake of this example, select <span class="packt_screen">OPT-OUT</span>. Once <span class="packt_screen">OPT-OUT</span> is selected, you will be able to choose your APK file for upload from your computer's file system. Select your APK for upload by clicking <span class="packt_screen">BROWSE FILES</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/002ad88b-cf74-4b3f-9051-4c5ecee2ae3c.jpg" style="width:47.50em;height:32.08em;"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After selecting an appropriate APK, it will be uploaded to the Google Play Console. Once the upload is done, the play console will automatically add a suggested release name for your beta release. This release name is based on the version name of the uploaded APK. Modify the release name if you are not comfortable with the suggestion. Next, add a suitable release note in the text field provided. Once you are satisfied with the data you have input, save and continue by clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Review&#160;</span>button at the bottom of the web page. After reviewing the beta release, you can roll it out if you have added beta testers to your app. Rolling out a beta release is not our focus, so let's divert back to our main goal: publishing the Messenger app.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having uploaded an APK for your application, you can now complete the mandatory content rating questionnaire. Click the <span class="packt_screen">Content rating&#160;</span>navigation item on the sidebar and follow the instructions to do this. Once the questionnaire is complete, appropriate ratings for your application will be generated:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/d57eb45b-4ed4-40bf-9d59-371e513d7c2a.jpg" style="width:54.92em;height:27.92em;"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the completion of the content rating questionnaire, the application is ready to be published to production. Applications that are published to production are made available to all users on the Google Play Store. On the play console, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">App releases</span>&#160;| <span class="packt_screen">Manage Production</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Create releases</span>. When prompted to upload an APK, click the <span class="packt_screen">ADD APK FROM LIBRARY</span>&#160;button to the right of the screen and select the APK we previously uploaded (the APK with a version name of 1.0)&#160;and complete the necessary release details similar to how we did when creating a beta release. Click the review button at the bottom of the page once you are ready to proceed. You will be given a brief release summary in the page that follows:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/1400b87f-aa7d-48aa-80b6-ab8b47ca8c46.jpg" style="width:49.50em;height:25.00em;"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Go through the information presented in the summary carefully. Start the roll out to production once you have asserted that you are satisfied with the information presented to you in the summary. Once you start the roll out to production, you will be prompted to confirm your understanding that your app will become available to users of the Play Store:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/2e6201d0-eaaf-4429-b4fb-c2ea42e1882e.jpg" style="width:69.17em;height:21.33em;"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Click <span class="packt_screen">Confirm</span> once you are ready for the Messenger app to go live on the Play Store. Congratulations! You have now published your first application to the Google Play Store!</span></p>
