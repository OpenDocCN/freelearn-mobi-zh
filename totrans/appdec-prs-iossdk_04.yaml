    evidence. Now you have access to analytics to find the meaning behind the numbers
    and to differentiate the data based on the associated event. Data charts allow
    you to make business strategies. For example, the total time the user is spending
    on their application, and how a small shift can improve their outcomes. Analytics
    saves time by providing context to the data; this helps us to maximize productivity
    and prioritize tasks.
