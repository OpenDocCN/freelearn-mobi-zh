- en: In this book, we will build a restaurant reservation app called *Let's Eat*.
    We will start the book off by exploring Xcode, our programming environment, which
    is also known as Interface Development Environment (IDE). Next, you will start
    learning the foundations of Swift, the programming language used in iOS apps.
    Once we are comfortable with the basics of Swift, we will dig deeper to build
    a more solid foundation.

- en: After we have a solid foundation of using Swift, we will start creating the
    visual aspects of our *Let's Eat* app. During this process, we will work with
    storyboards and connect our app's structure together using segues. With our UI
    complete, we will go over the different ways in which we can display data. To
    display our data in a grid, we will use Collection Views, and to display our data
    in a list, we will use Table Views.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will also look at how to add basic and custom annotations on to a map. Finally,
    it's time to get real data; we will look at what an Application Programming Interface
    (API) is and how we can get real restaurant data into our Collection Views, Table
    Views, and Map.

- en: We now have a complete app, but how about adding some bells and whistles? The
    first place we can add a feature will be on the restaurant detail page where we
    can add restaurant reviews. Here, users will be able to take or choose a picture
    and apply a filter on to their picture. They will also be able to give the restaurant
    a rating as well as a review. When they are done, we will save this data using
    Core Data.

- en: Since we built our app to work on both iPhone and iPad, we should add the ability
    to make our app support iPad Multitasking. Doing this will allow our app to be
    open alongside another app at the same time.

- en: If we want to be able to send our reservation to a friend, we can create a custom
    UI for iMessages, which will send them the details for the reservation along with
    the app it came from. The one thing missing from our app is the ability to notify
    the user with a custom notification to alert when they have an upcoming reservation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, let's create a quick access for our app using 3D touch where, by tapping
    our app icon, the user can quickly jump to their reservations. Now that we have
    added some bells and whistles, let's get this app to our friends using TestFlight,
