The interface for Unity is composed of a Toolbar area that consists of 5 basic control groups and a number of user customizable areas that can contain Views.<a id="id36" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec01"/>Transform tools</h2></div></div></div><p>The transform tools are used with the Scene View and allow you to manipulate the objects in the scene. We will take a moment to walk through these tools since we will spend much of our time using them.<a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_1.jpg" alt="Transform tools"/></div><p>Working our way from left to right the first of the tools is a multi-use tool that is used to manipulate the camera in the scene. The camera you're moving is of your view of the scene and has no relationship to what is actually shown in the game.</p><p>In the default mode, the<strong> Hand</strong> tool will simply translate the camera around. Pressing the left mouse button and dragging will translate along the X-axis of the camera. If you have a mouse wheel, scrolling that wheel will move the camera along the Z-axis.<a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_2.jpg" alt="Transform tools"/></div><p>Holding the<em> Alt</em> key or the right mouse button will cause the Hand to change into an Eye. In this mode you can orbit the camera around its current pivot point in the scene. The Scene Gizmo in the upper left of the scene view reflects this. As you pivot the camera, the gizmo will update to reflect the current camera pivot.<a id="id40" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_3.jpg" alt="Transform tools"/></div><p>Holding the<em> Control</em> key allows you to zoom the camera as you move the mouse around in the scene. This is particularly useful if you need to get in close to where some critical action should be taking place.<a id="id41" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec02"/>Transform Gizmo Toggles</h2></div></div></div><p>There are two gizmos that determine how the updates to an object, using the Transform Gizmo, will impact on the object. The Transform Gizmo is just as it sounds, it appears in the Scene View and allows us to change the position or rotation of an object. These toggles determine where the Gizmo will appear.<a id="id42" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_4.jpg" alt="Transform Gizmo Toggles"/></div><p>The first toggle is the<strong> Position</strong> toggle. If set to<strong> Center</strong>, the Transformation Gizmo will appear in the center of the object's bounds that you want to transform. In most cases this is what you want if you are laying out an object in a scene. However, if you want to change an object's position based upon its pivot point, select<strong> Pivot</strong> for the setting of the toggle.</p><p>The second toggle is the<strong> Rotation</strong> toggle. Here you will determine whether or not rotations will be relative to the object's Local coordinate system or based upon the Global or world space coordinate system.<a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec03"/>VCR Controls</h2></div></div></div><p>The next set of controls is used to drive the gameplay in the Game View. The visual representation of these controls is so commonplace that they almost require no explanation.<a id="id44" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_5.jpg" alt="VCR Controls"/></div><p>The<strong> Play</strong> control will cause the game to start playing. If you want to stop and look at things you press the<strong> Pause</strong> button. When the<strong> Pause</strong> button is pressed, Unity will switch to<strong> Scene</strong> view (unless already displayed) so you can examine the details of the scene. Pressing<strong> Pause</strong> again will cause the game to continue where it left off. If, while paused, you want to determine what will happen in the next cycle, you can press the<strong> Step</strong> button. Pressing the<strong> Step</strong> button while a game is playing will cause it to enter a paused state.<a id="id45" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"/>Tip</h3><p>If the<strong> Scene View</strong> is on a separate tab you will be able to see both views at the same time.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec04"/>Layers drop-down</h2></div></div></div><p>As you develop your applications you will create layers in the<strong> Scene View</strong> which represent groups of game objects that you want to display in the view. This helps to unclutter the display in a very complex scene.<a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_7.jpg" alt="Layers drop-down"/></div><p>In the<strong> Layers</strong> drop-down you can select what layers you want to see and which ones you want to hide. The hidden objects are still there and will display in Game View the next time the game is run.<a id="id47" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec05"/>Layout drop-down</h2></div></div></div><p>During the development of creating a game you will find that some tools are useful for some scenarios and not useful in others. Custom layouts allow you to define a collection of views, and their position and configuration, while providing a unique name for the layout so that you can switch to it later.<a id="id48" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_6.jpg" alt="Layout drop-down"/></div><p>The<strong> Layout</strong> drop-down will display all of the layouts that are available for you to switch to, allowing you to rapidly move between multiple IDE arrangements so that you have the tools that are important to you when you need them.<a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec06"/>Project view</h2></div></div></div><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_8.jpg" alt="Project view"/></div><p>The<strong> Project</strong> view is where you will manage all of the assets that are in your project. However, if the files in those folders get updated (that is, you change the mesh of an object in some other tool), those updates will be changed in Unity as well.<a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"/>Tip</h3><p>This view corresponds to the Asset folder of your project, but you should NEVER make changes to the project folder directly, you should make your changes in the Unity Project view.</p></div><p>You can add new assets to your project by simply dragging them from the desktop, or file system browser, right into the project view and Unity will import the content for use. Under the covers, Unity will also move the assets into the project's Assets folder.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec07"/>Hierarchy view</h2></div></div></div><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_9.jpg" alt="Hierarchy view"/></div><p>The<strong> Hierarchy</strong> view is a close peer to the<strong> Project</strong> view. Where the<strong> Project</strong> view is responsible for managing the assets that are available to your sandbox — the<strong> Scene</strong> view, the<strong> Hierarchy</strong> view is used to manage the objects that are in the scene and the parent child relationships of those objects. For example, you may have a vehicle object in the scene that has a light attached to it. In the<strong> Hierarchy</strong> view these objects would have a parent child relationship, such that the light would be the child of the vehicle object. The result would mean that as the parent object changed through transform, rotation, or other the child object would be impacted.<a id="id51" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>In large projects there will be a large number of objects in the<strong> Hierarchy</strong> view. To make it easier to find particular objects, or types of objects, Unity provides the search box in the<strong> Hierarchy</strong> view. When you enter the name of an object, Unity will filter the<strong> Scene</strong> view such that the objects you have entered are clearly visible in the view while the other objects are grayed-out. For example, suppose you are trying to find the steering wheel component of a scene that consists of a large number of game objects. If you enter<strong> steering wheel</strong> in the search box it will only provide texture, color, and so on to that object so that it is easy to find. Similarly, if you enter a type of object, such as<strong> light</strong>, in the search box the scene will only highlight the lights in the scene — even if the word 'light' isn't in the name of the Game Object.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec08"/>Scene view</h2></div></div></div><p>The<strong> Scene</strong> view is where you will you will spend most of your time. It is in the Scene view that you will build your game, position the camera, change environment settings, observe occlusion levels, and so on:<a id="id52" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_11.jpg" alt="Scene view"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec09"/>Game view</h2></div></div></div><p>The<strong> Game</strong> view is where the action takes place. Whenever you press<strong> Play</strong> in the VCR controls, this view will use the active camera in the scene and render what that camera sees to the<strong> Game</strong> view:<a id="id53" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_12.jpg" alt="Game view"/></div><p>The<strong> Control Bar</strong>, in the<strong> Game</strong> view, contains useful controls for adjusting the Game view to deliver information useful in rendering the<strong> Game</strong> view closer to the actual target display:<a id="id54" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_13.jpg" alt="Game view"/></div><p>The first tool in the<strong> Control Bar</strong> is the<strong> Free Aspect</strong> drop-down that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the<strong> Game</strong> view to different values. This is particularly important for iOS development as you can select the aspect ratio of your target device and get a better idea of how your content will look with the appropriate perspective applied.<a id="id55" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The next tool is the<strong> Maximize on Play</strong> toggle which, when enabled, will display the<strong> Game</strong> view in full screen. In the case where this<strong> Game</strong> view is not the same resolution as the screen, you will note that the<strong> Game</strong> view maximizes to cover the entire display, but only renders the scene at whatever resolution / aspect ratio you have set in the<strong> Free Aspect</strong> drop-down.<a id="id56" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The next control is the<strong> Gizmos</strong> control. This will force Unity to render all of the Gizmos that are present in the<strong> Scene</strong> view in the<strong> Game</strong> view.<a id="id57" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The final control is the<strong> Stats</strong> control. When enabled this will show the Rendering Statistics window overlaid on the<strong> Game</strong> view. This is an extremely useful control to have active, as you will gain insight into how your application is performing at a high-level, without having to delve into the<strong> Profiler</strong> view while playing the game.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec10"/>Inspector</h2></div></div></div><p>The<strong> Inspector</strong> view contains all of the properties for the selected Game Object in a view. The properties that the Inspector shows are entirely context sensitive based upon the Game Object selected:<a id="id58" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_14.jpg" alt="Inspector"/></div><p>As Game Objects in Unity are composed of components such as meshes, scripts, transforms, and so on. each of the components that make up the Game Object will have its editor appear in the<strong> Inspector</strong>. So, for example, in our example<strong> Inspector</strong> we've selected a camera in the scene. As you can see the Transform, Camera, and so on each have editors that show up for this Game Object.<a id="id59" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec11"/>Console view</h2></div></div></div><p>The<strong> Console</strong> view shows all of the messages that come from your game. These messages may come from the Unity engine, or may represent messages which you have sent to the<strong> Console</strong> view using the script commands, such as<code class="literal"> Debug.Log()</code>. If you double-click on the messages that appear in the<strong> Console</strong> view, you will be taken directly to the script that caused the message:<a id="id60" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_15.jpg" alt="Console view"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec12"/>Profiler view</h2></div></div></div><p>The Unity Profiler is your best friend when building games with Unity, particularly when developing for an iOS device. While the tool is only available with the Pro version of Unity, it deserves special attention as it provides substantially more information than the Rendering Statistics window in<strong> Game</strong> view:<a id="id61" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_16.jpg" alt="Profiler view"/></div><p>In the top are profile tools that provide information about CPU Usage, Rendering, Memory, and Audio statistics. Next to each Profiler is a histogram representing the values retrieved from the instrumentation process on each frame. You can click and drag the mouse across the histogram and see the results across multiple profile tools, which will help to correlate specific performance issues with other events that occur in the application:<a id="id63" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_17.jpg" alt="Profiler view"/></div><p>The bottom provides information about function calls that are being made by the application. This is done by instrumenting the code and determining how often the functions are being called. This can help determine where the hot spots are within an application so that you can focus your attention and get your game performing well on your target platform:</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_18.jpg" alt="Profiler view"/></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec02"/>Time for action —  Creating a new layout</h1></div></div></div><p>While the Unity environment has a lot of features and options, it is possible to become entirely overwhelmed by the amount of data, or not realize that something has gone awry. We will look at building out a simple customization for our environment that contains the views we need, as well as some of the views that don't appear in the interface by default, in order to prepare ourselves for testing applications. If you're familiar with the Eclipse development environment you may be thinking that Unity opens views depending on what action you're performing, but Unity doesn't do that. However, we are going to emulate some of that functionality by creating a new layout that is well suited to profiling an application.<a id="id64" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Our first step for creating a new layout is to start with a base layout and customize it. Unity has several default layouts to choose from, but for our purposes we will choose the Wide layout. In the<strong> Window</strong> Menu, select<strong> Wide</strong> layout:<a id="id65" class="indexterm"/><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_19.jpg" alt="Time for action — Creating a new layout"/></div></li><li class="listitem">The next, step to creating our layout, is to decide which views are most important for getting things done. Since we're planning to profile an application it makes sense to bring in the<strong> Profile</strong> view into our environment. Selecting the<strong> Window</strong> menu and Profiler will show the new view. However, you will notice that it is a standalone window and not attached to the rest of the environment. Unity doesn't require that all of the views live within the same window as the others. In fact, this makes it easier for users with multiple screens as you can have different groupings of views on different screens. However, for our purposes we will assume that we have one screen to work with.<a id="id66" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem">To position the Profiler inside our interface select the<strong> Profiler</strong> tab and drag it. This will result in a grayed out version of the tab appearing in the interface. As you move this grayed-out version into places where it can be docked, it will change shape to illustrate what it will look like if you dock it in that position. For now let's release it right above the<strong> Hierarchy</strong> view and the<strong> Project</strong> view:<a id="id67" class="indexterm"/></li></ol></div><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_20.jpg" alt="Time for action — Creating a new layout"/></div><p>Since we're profiling our application we probably don't really need to know much about the Project's layout so we can remove the<strong> Project</strong> view from the layout. To accomplish this we need to select the<strong> Menu</strong> drop-down which appears in the upper right of the view and select the<strong> Close</strong> tab. Once done, the<strong> Project</strong> view will no longer be in the layout. Don't worry, if you ever need to bring it back you can always go into the<strong> Window</strong> menu and dock it in the same manner in which we introduced the<strong> Profiler</strong> view.<a id="id68" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Now we probably also want console messages, as they represent feedback from our game session. We will introduce the console by selecting<strong> Window | Console</strong>. When the console menu appears we will drag it right next to the<strong> Hierarchy</strong> tab, such that it appears as a tab in the same row with the<strong> Hierarchy</strong>. This represents the other layout option that Unity provides, which is to have rows of tabs for views:<a id="id69" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_21.jpg" alt="Time for action — Creating a new layout"/></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec13"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>We have created a new layout specifically for profiling an application and saved it, so that whenever we are ready to dive deep into debugging and application profiling we can simply switch to it, without having to otherwise clutter our environment when we are simply designing our game. This has some very substantial implications for productivity as the interface can be set up for a particular purpose, such as level editing, scripting, or testing and you can focus the environment on specifically what you need. While it may not seem like a large detail right now, as your projects get bigger you will be glad this level of flexibility is there.<a id="id70" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec03"/>Time for action —  Saving a new layout</h1></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Now that we have created our new layout, we need to save it so we can reuse it later.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec04"/>Time for action —  Deploying Unity Remote</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the hardest things to do when building an application for an iOS device is to be able to get some real time feedback from the device, while still having the richness of the development environment to work with. Unity solves this problem with the Unity Remote application that will allow you to play test your application within Unity, while using the iOS device as a controller. Unity Remote accomplishes this by streaming the game to the iOS device through WiFi and gathering the input actions from the device and injecting them into the Unity environment. With Unity Remote you can avoid having to build and deploy your application to your device every time you make a change.<a id="id76" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>There is only one problem with Unity Remote when it comes to testing our application — we need to build it specifically for our device.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>Remember, all iOS applications must be signed before they can be installed on the device.</p></div><p>We are going to walk through each of the steps necessary to produce commercial content for Unity 3 that can be deployed to an iOS device:<a id="id77" class="indexterm"/>

</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Run Unity Remote on your device and a list of the machines ready to provide data for Unity Remote will appear in the list. If, for some reason, yours doesn't because of specific DNS or Bonjour security, you can enter the IP address of the machine you want to control by selecting the button in the lower left. If you don't really care to simulate the visual interface of the game on the iOS device you can change the radio button for<strong> Show image</strong> to<strong> Off</strong> and the game's frames will not be displayed on your device, yet you will still be able to control the game inside of Unity with your iOS device acting as a controller:<a id="id88" class="indexterm"/><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_25.jpg" alt="Time for action — Testing our application using Unity Remote"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Press<strong> Play</strong> in the Unity toolbar. This will be the signal for Unity and Unity Remote to begin exchanging data. The content that is in the<strong> Game</strong> view will begin to appear on the iOS device, though you may think something is wrong the first time you see it as it will appear to be a much lower resolution version of your game:<a id="id89" class="indexterm"/><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_33.jpg" alt="Time for action — Testing our application using Unity Remote"/><div><p>Game View representation of the game in Unity</p></div></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none">If you recall, I mentioned that Unity streams the game to the iOS device. What the IDE is doing is actually streaming the video of what's happening in the game to your device so you will see a variety of compression artifacts, depending on your Wi-Fi connection speed and other factors:<a id="id90" class="indexterm"/></li></ul></div><div><img src="img/978-1-84969-040-9_2_26.jpg" alt="Time for action — Testing our application using Unity Remote"/><div><p>View of the game on Unity Remote</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">This is a normal behavior of Unity Remote (and one of the reasons for the Show Image radio button) and should not detract in any way from your ability to perform your testing. Remember, this is purely a testing tool to enable rapid development so visual fidelity is not necessary. If you really need to know exactly how its going to look, you can deploy the game to the device — but bookmark this chapter as you will find that after some time the benefit of knowing how great your content looks on the device will pale into comparison to being more productive using Unity Remote.<a id="id91" class="indexterm"/></li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec16"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>What Unity Remote is doing behind the scenes is getting the frame buffer of the application and compressing that into a video stream and streaming that over to the iOS device. Any device input that is gathered through the iOS device is then transmitted through Wi-Fi to the Unity IDE and used to direct the objects in the environment. Whenever you enter<strong> Play</strong> mode in the<strong> Editor</strong>, your device will become the remote control for testing the game.<a id="id92" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>While this approach is very useful for rapid application development, it is important to note that performance using this approach is approximated at best and you will still want to build and run your application on your device exclusively every so often, to confirm that performance and gameplay is as you expect. Similarly, it is important to note that this approach is very dependent on your Wi-Fi connection. If your device isn't showing a full Wi-Fi signal you can expect significant performance implications.</p><p>We have just performed all of the steps necessary to setup our development environment and publish content to Unity. Further we have built our own mini testing lab using Unity Remote so we can utilize our device, yet debug the game in our development environment. This is a crucial milestone as we can now focus entirely on customizing Unity and building games.</p><p>One last thing about Unity Remote that is worth noting, while I had you build the remote application yourself you can actually download this in the App Store. Given this you may be asking yourself then why did you have me build it? As an iOS developer, even one using Unity, there are a number of times that you will find yourself needing to debug what is happening under the covers with XCode. In addition, you may find yourself wanting to integrate with some native feature of iOS that isn't supported in Unity. In all of these scenarios you will find yourself digging through the underlying XCode project, so now seemed to be the best time to get familiar with how things are put together.</p><p>Links to the Unity Remote :<a id="id93" class="indexterm"/>

To get more in depth coverage of the Unity interface and its options, it is recommended that you read through the Unity documentation.</p><p>With the first two chapters under our belts, we can now leave behind the pre-built projects and begin building games from scratch, which is the subject of the next chapter — Hello World.</p></div></body></html>
