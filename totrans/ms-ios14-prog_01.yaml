    in iOS 14\. Using the latest features in your apps can make a huge difference
    for users in terms of engagement, positive reviews, and overall user experience.
    It can also lead to other benefits, such as being featured by Apple in the App
    Store, and having an advantage over competitors' apps in the same category.

    year, Apple released Swift 5.3\. These versions focus on quality and performance

    its own processors to the world. Developers can start building apps and ship them
    by the end of 2020, starting a transition that will last two years. This transition
    will establish a common architecture across all Apple products. With a common
    architecture, it will be easier to create apps for the entire Apple ecosystem.'

    stay up to date, with no version upgrading process in the middle. However, developers

    version available and will download it when the system decides it's appropriate
    (for example, in the background while the phone is locked and charging on a Wi-Fi
    connection). So, developers should take into account that the model update may
    or may not be fast or in real time. The operating system will have the last word.

    the different ways to invoke them. We looked at the design guidelines and the
    streamlined process by using Sign in with Apple and Apple Pay. Later, we jumped
    into widgets with WidgetKit. We have described how you can create widgets of three
    different sizes and looked at their design guidelines. We have discovered the
    new features and improvements in augmented reality and machine learning. Privacy
    also gets some updates, allowing end users to control what they share in more
    detail. Finally, we also learned about new language features of Swift 5.2 and
    Swift 5.3\.
