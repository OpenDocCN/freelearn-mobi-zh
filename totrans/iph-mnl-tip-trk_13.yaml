    run into people you'll want to contact in the future. In the old days, you might
    exchange business cards or phone numbers on a piece of paper, but it's far simpler
    and more accurate to store someone's name and contact information in your iPhone
    instead.

    and email addresses you need, but your iPhone will also let you call, text, FaceTime,
    or email someone as well. With your iPhone, you can store information about friends,
    relatives, and co-workers that you can easily share with others as well.

    as you need about each person. At the very least, you need to store someone's

- en: At its simplest level, the **Contacts** app can store names and contact information
    that you can retrieve at any time. With one tap, you can send an email message,
    make a phone or FaceTime call, or send a text message. If someone gives you their
    website or social media contact, you can reach that person that way as well.

- en: Besides storing names and contact information, you can also directly contact
    people from the **Contacts** app. This saves you time typing an email address
    or phone number over and over again.

    That way, if you're ever in an accident, authorities will be able to contact your
    loved ones and access your medical history.

- en: Storing names and contact information is important, but often you need this
    information when you need to call or meet certain people. So, in the next chapter,
    you'll learn about setting appointments and reminders. That way, you'll never
    be late or miss an appointment again.
