- en: This book is a practical guide to learning enterprise build systems with Gradle.
    This book helps you to master the core concepts of the tool and to quickly apply
    the knowledge to real-life projects. Throughout the book, all the chapters are
    supported by sufficient examples so that the reader can easily follow and absorb
    the concepts. The book is divided into 10 chapters. The first six chapters are
    aimed at gaining knowledge about fundamental topics such as Task, Plugins, Dependency
    Management, various in-built plugins, and a lot more. The next few chapters cover
    diverse topics such as Continuous Integration, Migration, and Deployment, which
    enables readers to learn concepts that are very useful for agile software development.
    The last chapter of the book focuses on the Android build system with Gradle,
    which will be useful for mobile developers.
