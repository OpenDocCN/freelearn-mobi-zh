- en: The iPhone is a combination of a music player, pocket computer, and mobile phone,
    but is sold as a phone, and so has the essential purpose of letting you make phone
    calls. While making and receiving calls sounds simple, there can be all kinds
    of variations involved in making and receiving calls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you might want to hold a conference call so you can chat with multiple
    people at the same time. Or, while on a call, you may get another call so you
    need to put one person on hold so you can answer the second call. You might also
    get calls from people you no longer want to hear from, so you block certain calls.
    Additionally, while on hold, you may be instructed to press a number to choose
    an option.

    calls can range from simple to complicated, depending on what you want to do.
    In this chapter, you'll learn all the basics involved in making and receiving
    phone calls, along with additional features you may find useful as you talk on
    your iPhone.

    For example, many businesses advertise their phone number in public so people
    can call to get information or purchase a product or service.

    Instead, it's far more common to store someone's phone number once and then simply
    tap that person's name to dial their phone number to reach them.

    in a text message. Then you can simply tap that phone number to call it without
    having to type in the number yourself. With so many different ways to make a phone
    call, you have lots of choice in how you make a phone call with your iPhone.
