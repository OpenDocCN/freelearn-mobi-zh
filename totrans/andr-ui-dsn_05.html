Your app's design will have a massive impact on its usability, usefulness, and ultimately, its popularity; badly-designed apps are difficult to understand and not much fun to use!</p><p>Designing for mobile can be tough, but it's also one of the most exciting platforms to develop for, as it's a fast-moving industry where new hardware is being released all the time. This means there are lots of opportunities to come up something totally unique that'll blow your users away.</p><p>This chapter will show you how to become a design-minded developer who knows how to design <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> develop amazing apps that'll have no problems racking up rave reviews on the Google Play store.</p><div class="section" title="Brainstorming - taking advantage of mobile hardware"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec35"/>Brainstorming - taking advantage of mobile hardware</h1></div></div></div><p>When you're designing a mobile application, don't forget that your typical Android device has lots of interesting hardware that's unique to the mobile platform. Just think of all the things your mobile app can react to because of this unique hardware: touch gestures, tilting, audio input and output, geolocation, and much more.</p><p>If you want your app to stand out from the crowd, you need to look for ways of using these hardware capabilities in new and engaging ways.</p><p>Before we start planning our app, let's take a look at some of the most interesting Android hardware capabilities that you may want to incorporate into your mobile applications.</p><div class="section" title="Touch and gestures"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec68"/>Touch and gestures</h2></div></div></div><p>The most common method of interacting with an app is via the device's touchscreen, so you'll definitely want to integrate gestures into your design.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that users do have expectations about the gestures they can use to interact with Android apps. They'll expect to be able to perform certain actions by swiping, dragging, pinching, and tapping on-screen elements. And although you want your app to stand out for its unique use of touch and gestures, you'll need to balance this against ensuring your users intuitively know how to interact with your app.</p><p>Don't try to reinvent common gestures just for the sake of it. For example, most users will expect to be able to move a slider by tapping or dragging it—so what's the point of reinventing something that already works perfectly well?</p><p>As you'll find throughout this chapter, designing the perfect Android app is a balancing act between creating something that's unique and innovative and something that feels familiar.</p></div><div class="section" title="GPS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec69"/>GPS</h2></div></div></div><p>Location awareness isn't just for Google Maps-style apps!</p><p>You can use GPS coordinates in lots of different ways; for example, you may want to create an app that suggests nearby events and tourist attractions based on the user's current location, tags photos with the location where a picture was taken, or broadcasts the user's coordinates to friends who may be wondering if anyone they know is nearby.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note38"/>Note</h3><p>Don't fall into the trap of thinking location awareness is only useful for getting directions. There are lots of ways you can use this hardware feature to enhance your Android apps.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Vibration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec70"/>Vibration</h2></div></div></div><p>You should use vibration when audio alerts get distracting or annoying (whether that's annoying for your users or annoying for the people around them!). Although this hardware feature is easy to overlook, take a moment to think about how your app might use vibration as an additional way of communicating with the user.</p><p>One example can be a meditation app that plays soothing music or relaxing ocean noises. Imagine you want to subtly notify the user when they've been meditating for a full 15 minutes, just in case they get carried away and lose track of time. In this scenario, an audio notification would be jarring and would completely ruin the mood. Wouldn't it be better to alert the user with a discrete vibration instead?</p></div><div class="section" title="Audio input/output"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec71"/>Audio input/output</h2></div></div></div><p>When you think about audio input, chances are you think about talking to your friends or issuing voice commands to apps such as Google Search. When it comes to output, you probably think of audio notifications, listening to said friends, or listening to things such as music and audiobooks.</p><p>These are all valid examples, but audio is a feature with endless possibilities, so consider whether your app could use audio input and output in more creative and unusual ways.</p><p>In particular, you'll want to make heavy use of audio input and output if your app is going to be used in situations where it might be awkward or inappropriate to interact with an app via other methods. Issuing a quick voice command to our smartphone is often much more socially acceptable than tapping away at a keyboard for ages, which is often be seen as rude.</p><p>At the extreme end of the scale, audio gives your users a means of communicating with your app when other methods might be dangerous. If you're creating an app that gives driving directions, then encouraging the driver to take their eyes off the road in order to read text-based directions is <span class="emphasis"><em>definitely</em></span> a bad idea.</p></div><div class="section" title="Interacting with other devices"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec72"/>Interacting with other devices</h2></div></div></div><p>No Android device is an island! Android smartphones and tablets can connect over channels such as Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC), Wi-Fi, and mobile networks, which open up a whole new world of possibilities for your app.</p><p>Even more excitingly, Android smartphones and tablets can connect with less-traditional Android devices and Google services, such as wearables, Android TVs, and beacons. Would your app provide a better user experience if it could send and receive information from additional devices?</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note39"/>Note</h3><p>Google's beacon platform allows your app to interact with simple, low-energy devices known as beacons. Nearby beacons are useful for providing an innovative location and proximity experience to your users. They're beyond the scope of this book, but you can read about them at 
<a class="ulink" href="https://developers.google.com/beacons/">https://developers.google.com/beacons/</a>
.</p></div></div><p>These are just a few of the hardware-related features you may want to consider when you're in the early stages of brainstorming your app.</p><p>If your head is currently spinning with ideas, then it's a good thing! Make a note of all the off-the-wall ideas you come up with, so you can revisit them once you've planned your app a bit more. And even if these ideas don't fit with the app you end up creating, then who knows, they may turn out to be perfect fit for your next Android project!</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip40"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Don't get carried away!</strong></span></p><p>When you're brainstorming all the cool and creative features that you can include in your app, the golden rule is not to try to squeeze anything into your app just for the sake of it.</p><p>Even if you've come up with an idea that you're convinced is pure genius, if it doesn't fit with your current project, then don't waste a good idea on an app that it just isn't right for. Make a note of your idea, and remember that just because you're not implementing it in your current project doesn't mean it won't find its way into your next one. This is a good rule to remember throughout the entire planning, designing, and developing process.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="The difference between UX and UI"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec36"/>The difference between UX and UI</h1></div></div></div><p>Even though UX and UI are often used interchangeably, they're not synonymous.</p><p>UX stands for <span class="strong"><strong>user experience</strong></span>. All the code you write contributes to the user experience, whether it's UI code (such as the XML that creates a button and places it on the screen) or non-visual code, such as the code for remembering the user's address and using it to auto-fill all the forms throughout your app.</p><p>Non-visual and visual code come together to deliver your app's user experience, but if looked at in isolation, visual code <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> delivers your app's UI.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip41"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Market Research</strong></span></p><p>Throughout this chapter, I'll be encouraging you to examine how other apps deliver an effective UI and UX. But as a general rule, if you ever find yourself struggling to overcome a particular design problem, it may help to flick through a few of the Android apps that you have installed on your smartphone or tablet to see how they tackle similar design challenges.
If you're struggling for general inspiration, then looking at a few examples of Android applications that deliver an effective UI and UX is often the best way to kickstart your creativity.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Brainstorming your app"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec37"/>Brainstorming your app</h1></div></div></div><p>When you have an idea for a new Android project, the first step is to get all your thoughts down on paper.</p><div class="section" title="Writing a concept"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec73"/>Writing a concept</h2></div></div></div><p>A well thought-out app solves a specific (and ideally <span class="emphasis"><em>unique</em></span>) problem, and the best way to capture this information is by writing a clear concept.</p><p>A concept should be short and to the point, so try to express your app in a single sentence, for example, "I want to create an easy note-taking app for high school students."</p></div><div class="section" title="Creating an ultimate features list"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec74"/>Creating an ultimate features list</h2></div></div></div><p>Now's the time to let your imagination run wild and write down all the features you'd like your app to have. This list might include features that aren't practical, but that's okay. Think of this as your dream features list of everything you'd include in your app if time, money, and technical limitations weren't an issue.</p></div><div class="section" title="Identifying your app's primary task"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec75"/>Identifying your app's primary task</h2></div></div></div><p>The most effective apps have a clear primary task. A note-taking app might have social features, such as tagging people in notes, the ability to record videos, and support for images, but its primary task is making quick, text-based notes. Everything else is a nice-to-have added extra.</p><p>A good trick for getting to the core of what your application is all about is to write a quick explanation of your app's purpose, something that's known as a <span class="strong"><strong>product statement</strong></span>.</p><p>Use this template for your product definition statement:</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>(What makes your application stand out from the crowd) (What your application is)</em></span>
</p><p>Some examples of product statements are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A streamlined and simple note-taking app</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A secure and encrypted SMS app</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A beautiful lockscreen replacement app</li></ul></div><p>This product statement should be at the forefront of your mind the entire time you're working on your project, so you may want to scribble it on a post-it note.</p><p>Congratulations, you've just turned your spark of inspiration into a clear statement about the kind of app you want to create. But before you progress with this idea, it's time to ask yourself some tough questions.</p></div><div class="section" title="Is this application right for mobile?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec76"/>Is this application right for mobile?</h2></div></div></div><p>Nowadays, we can pretty much do the same things on our mobile devices as we can on our home computers. We can send e-mails, watch YouTube videos, write lengthy text documents, edit photos, and check Facebook all on our smartphones and tablets.</p><p>Mobile devices have also taken over the roles of many other electronic and non-electronic items. We can add appointments to the Google Calendar app rather than scribbling them on a paper calendar, store all our contacts in a digital phone book rather than a physical one, and as camera phones become increasingly powerful, we no longer have to cart a bulky digital camera around in order to snap high-quality photos.</p><p>Whenever you come up with a software idea, it's tempting to automatically assume that it <span class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> to take the form of a mobile app. But even the most powerful mobile device has its limitations, so always ask yourself whether your idea might actually work better on a different platform.</p><p>Imagine you had an idea for a piece of software that'd help professional photographers make detailed and complex edits to their photos. You may automatically assume that this has to be a mobile application; after all, we're all taking more photos on our camera phones than ever before. But consider your target audience; are professional photographers likely to be snapping many photos with their camera phone? Aren't they more likely to have specialist photography equipment? Also, consider whether in-depth image editing is a good fit for the small touchscreen you find on your typical mobile device.</p><p>It probably makes make more sense to develop this particular idea as a piece of software for desktop computers, perhaps with a companion mobile app that offers a handful of features that are better suited to the mobile environment. This way, your users can snap a photo on their camera phone and make a few simple tweaks on the go. Then, if they decide they want to make more complex edits, they can always boot up their computer when they get home.</p></div><div class="section" title="Do you have the budget?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec77"/>Do you have the budget?</h2></div></div></div><p>Before getting stuck into a new project, it's important to take a long hard look at your budget to see whether this particular project is realistic.</p><p>Although, the word <span class="emphasis"><em>budget</em></span> implies money, a budget can also be time-related. If you're a solo Android enthusiast who's creating an app for fun in their spare time, then chances are that your biggest challenge will be finding spare time to devote to your project rather than sourcing funding. Estimate how much time you can realistically dedicate to your project, and then use this information to work out how long it'll take you to complete.</p><p>Be honest with yourself about what you can realistically achieve as well as how much time and money you can invest in your project.</p><p>Whether your main restriction is money or time, you may realize that this particular project isn't really practical; maybe you're too busy to complete the project within a reasonable amount of time, and you know you'll run out of steam before you reach the finishing line; or maybe your project needs a few extra hands on deck, and your budget won't stretch to employing any more people.</p><p>If this is the case, you may want to rethink your project to make it more practical. Maybe you can trim your features list, or free up more time by putting one of your hobbies on hold. Although it may be disheartening to cut back on features because of time or financial restraints, it's far less disheartening than proceeding with your project, and then a few months down the line realizing that, realistically, you're never going to reach that finish line.</p><p>Telling yourself some hard truths at this point will save you from investing time, effort, and money in something that isn't realistic.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Planning your app"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec38"/>Planning your app</h1></div></div></div><p>Planning is a step that's easy to skip, especially if you're flying solo, but taking some time to plan your project properly not only increases your changes of creating a more effective application, it also increases your chances of actually finishing your project, rather than abandoning it halfway through.</p><p>Skip this stage at your peril!</p><div class="section" title="Identifying your target audience"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec78"/>Identifying your target audience</h2></div></div></div><p>When you're in the early stages of planning your app, it's tempting to tell yourself, <span class="emphasis"><em>"This app is such a good idea, everyone will want to use it!"</em></span>
</p><p>If you buy into this statement, then your app will be perfect—but only for you. Since it doesn't make much sense to develop an app just for yourself (although, if you happen to like the finished product, then that's an added bonus), the first question you'll need to answer when planning your application is, <span class="emphasis"><em>"Who am I building this thing for?"</em></span>
</p><p>Too often we leave identifying our target audience until too late in the planning process, or even worse, we get carried away and start building an app without really knowing who we're building it <span class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span>. Your target audience should influence every part of your app: from its look and feel to the features you want to include, and even how you market and promote the finished product.</p><p>Hopefully, you already have a rough idea of who you're targeting, but to ensure that you create something that people actually want to use, you'll need to develop a deeper understanding of who exactly you're targeting. One way to do that is by developing personas and use cases:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>User personas</strong></span>: This is where you create a specific model of the kind of person you're creating your app for. A persona is an individual user who represents your target audience. To encourage you to think of this persona as a real person, you should give your user persona a name.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Use cases</strong></span>: This is a scenario of how, when, and where your persona might use your app.</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Creating a persona"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec30"/>Creating a persona</h3></div></div></div><p>To help you create a detailed user persona, ask your persona the following questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How old are you? This could be an exact age such as 18-25 year olds, or it could be more general, such as children or young adults.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What are your interests and hobbies? Do you like football? Baking? Shopping? Working out?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Do you identify as male or female (although not all applications will target a specific sex)?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Where do you live? This could be a specific country, city, or a type of area such as the countryside or by the sea.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Do you have children?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Do you have a job? And if so, what do you do?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Are you currently in school, college, or university?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Do you have any particular areas of expertise?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Why type of app do you use most often?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What other types of apps do you use?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What kind of application do you <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> use?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What influences you to make decisions?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How experienced are you with Android? Are you a pro user, or do you know just enough to get by?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What resonates with you on an emotional level? What makes you angry, happy, or sad?</li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note42"/>Note</h3><p>This is by no means an exhaustive list, but these questions should be enough to get you thinking about the kind of person you're targeting in more detail.</p></div></div><p>Let's look at an example of how a user persona can help you plan an application. Imagine you have an idea for a recipe app and have brainstormed a list of all the features you might want to include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The ability to filter recipes based on specific dietary requirements (gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, low fat, non-dairy), how many people they feed, and how easy they are to cook.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An estimated calorie count for each meal.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An estimated cost for each meal.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Social media integration, so users can share their favorite recipes with friends and family.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The ability to leave a range of feedback on each recipe; whether that's posting a comment, uploading a photo of their attempt, or giving the recipe a star rating.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An online scrapbook where users can save their favorite recipes.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The ability to purchase ingredients through the application.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Video tutorials so the user has the option to read the instructions or follow along with the video.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A built-in egg timer.</li></ul></div><p>The more ideas you jot down, the more you'll realize that even if all your ideas are well thought out, practical, and would add real value to your app; it simply isn't feasible to try and incorporate every single idea into a single application.</p><p>Not only would this be a nightmare for you in terms of the time and effort required to implement so many features, but it'd also be a nightmare for every user who opens your app and is immediately confronted by an exhaustive, incoherent list of features—and probably a cluttered and confusing UI to boot!</p><p>You should always aim to design the perfect app for a very specific audience rather than a generic app that tries to appeal to everyone; chances are that this kind of app is going to end up pleasing <span class="emphasis"><em>no one</em></span>.</p><p>So, how do you decide which features from your initial list should make the cut? The answer is to create a user persona and then cherry-pick all the features that'd appeal to this particular persona.</p><p>Let's create a user persona for our recipe app. Imagine our general target audience are university students who are facing the challenge of cooking for themselves for the first time. To help us bring this target audience to life, let's create a single-named persona—meet Nicole:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">She's 18</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">She's a university student</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">She lives in student halls with five other students</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">She doesn't have a car</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">This is the first time she's lived outside of the family home, so she has very little experience of cooking for herself</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">She's very money-conscious</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="The mobile persona"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec8"/>The mobile persona</h4></div></div></div><p>When you're designing a mobile app, you also need to take the <span class="strong"><strong>mobile persona</strong></span> into account. This is a set of additional characteristics that people assume when they're using a mobile app.</p><p>If you're one of the many Facebook users who likes to keep track of your friends and family on the go via the Facebook mobile app, then think about how the way you use the mobile app differs from how you use Facebook on your laptop or computer. Chances are that you automatically avoid activities that you know will drain your device's battery or eat into your data plan, such as watching or uploading videos. But this probably isn't something you worry too much about when you're accessing Facebook on your desktop.</p><p>When designing your mobile app, bear in mind that your typical mobile persona has the following characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A finite data plan.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A limited amount of battery.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Usually on the go, so they may have inconsistent Internet access and mobile network signal.</li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Rarely gives their Android device their undivided attention. Mobile users are some of the world's best multitaskers, who glance at their device while they're at the pub waiting for their friends, as they're killing time at the bus stop, or while they're laid on the sofa half-watching TV. Your typical mobile user doesn't want to be staring at your app's UI for any length of time; and if they do so, then it is usually a surefire sign that you've done something wrong and the user is trying to work out what they're supposed to do next.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Viewing your app on the small screen. Even your largest Android tablet has a <span class="emphasis"><em>much</em></span> smaller screen than other electronic devices, such as televisions and laptops.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Feels an emotional connection to their Android device. The way we relate to our smartphones, in particular, is very different to the way we relate to other electronic devices such as computers. Our smartphones are always by our side—whether they're in our hand, pocket, bag, or on our desk at work, and we use them for very personal tasks, such as keeping in touch with family and friends and snapping photos of our wild nights out and vacations. We store a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot </em></span>of sensitive information on our mobile devices, so it's only natural that we feel protective of them! Not convinced about the special relationship we all have with our phones? Just think about that moment of blind panic you feel when you reach into your pocket or bag for your phone, and it isn't there. This is a feeling we've all experienced at some point (although hopefully, your mobile turned out to be in a different coat pocket, and it wasn't really lost).</li></ul></div><p>If you disregard any of these attributes—for example, you develop a mobile app that gobbles up mobile data, or requests unnecessary access to lots of sensitive information—then your users are going to have a bad time. Your challenge is to create a compelling user experience for your specific target audience while still respecting all the characteristics of the mobile persona.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Creating use cases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec31"/>Creating use cases</h3></div></div></div><p>When might Nicole use our recipe app?

What features are going to appeal to Nicole?</p><p>I'm going to select the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The ability to filter recipes based on how easy they are to cook</strong></span>: This is a top priority for our first-time chef, particularly when she needs to hurry up and eat before her next lecture.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The ability to filter recipes based on how many people they feed</strong></span>: If Nicole is going to be cooking for her flat mates, then she needs easy access to recipes that'll feed six people.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>An estimated cost for each meal</strong></span>: As a budget-conscious student, Nicole doesn't want to blow all her student loan on fancy ingredients. She wants to be able to see <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> how much it'll cost her to cook each meal—particularly when it's the last few days before her next student loan installment comes through!</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Video tutorials</strong></span>: Nicole is an inexperienced cook, so she'd definitely appreciate the option to watch meals being prepared, rather than just reading instructions. She's also 18, which means she's grown up watching video tutorials on YouTube, so the thought of cooking along to a video on her smartphone has definite appeal.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>A built-in egg timer</strong></span>: This is the first time Nicole has lived outside of the family home, so she hasn't had the time to build up a stash of cooking utensils yet. She also doesn't want to waste her student loan on boring things such as egg timers, so if your app can provide this kind of functionality, then all the better!</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>The option to purchase ingredients through the app</strong></span>: As an 18-year old, Nicole is an expert at making online purchases, so getting the ingredients she needs delivered direct to her door is high on her (Amazon) wishlist. Nicole also doesn't have a car, so getting to her supermarket or local farmer's market isn't the easiest thing in the world. Ideally, our recipe app will be able to cross-check several vendors and suggest the place where she can purchase each ingredient at the lowest cost, to save even more of her student loan.</li></ul></div><p>There are other features in our list that might also appeal to Nicole; for example, she could be a vegan or have a few tried-and-tested family recipes she'd like to upload to the app, but be wary of getting <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> specific with your user personas.</p><p>While the ability to filter recipes based on dietary requirements, or giving users the option of adding their own recipes to the app would add value for certain users, ask yourself whether they're relevant for your target audience and not <span class="emphasis"><em>just</em></span> your user persona? If you're unsure, then try adding the features to your list and reading it from top to bottom, do these new features <span class="emphasis"><em>fit</em></span>? Or do they stick out like a sore thumb?</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note43"/>Note</h3><p>Even if you decide against adding certain features to your app now, they may still find their way into subsequent releases. If you feel like a feature has potential but isn't absolutely crucial for your app at this early stage, then make a note of it; you can always return to it at a later date.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Taking a critical look at your target audience"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec33"/>Taking a critical look at your target audience</h3></div></div></div><p>You've identified your target audience, but before we progress any further take a step back and have a critical look at your chosen audience. Does it <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> make sense to target this specific group of people?</p><div class="section" title="Does your target audience need a mobile app?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec9"/>Does your target audience need a mobile app?</h4></div></div></div><p>Is your app offering your target audience anything they're not getting already via a different platform?</p><p>Say, you had an idea for an app that keeps track of the user's appointments; might they already be getting this functionality elsewhere? Increasingly, places such as dentists, doctors, and hairdressers are reminding clients of upcoming appointments via SMS messages, or if you're targeting less tech-savvy users, they might prefer scribbling their schedule on a paper calendar.</p><p>Even though it's tempting to assume that <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> is better as a mobile app, your target audience is unlikely to make the effort to download a mobile app if their needs are already being met via a different medium.</p></div><div class="section" title="Is your target audience on Android?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec10"/>Is your target audience on Android?</h4></div></div></div><p>Gone are the days when serious business users opted for Blackberrys and all the cool kids went with iPhones. Nowadays, the lines are blurred, and it's becoming common practice to release an app across multiple platforms. But before you jump to conclusions, check whether there's evidence to suggest that your target audience favors one mobile platform over another. Perform a quick Google search for any recent research into mobile demographics, and see whether there's any data out there that raises red flags about your planned Android app.</p></div><div class="section" title="Okay, so your target audience is on Android, but does it own a suitable Android device?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec11"/>Okay, so your target audience is on Android, but does it own a suitable Android device?</h4></div></div></div><p>Don't assume that your target audience automatically has access to an Android device that's powerful enough to run your application, particularly since Android is such a fragmented platform.</p><p>If you design an app that relies on the user having access to the latest version of the Android operating system, then you're already limiting your audience. This may make sense if you're developing an app for advanced Android users who are more likely to have the latest version of Android installed on their device, but it might not be such a good idea if you're targeting general, non-pro Android users, older users, or people who are on tighter budgets who perhaps haven't invested in the latest Android device, such as money-conscious students.</p></div><div class="section" title="Do they use this &quot;type&quot; of application?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec12"/>Do they use this "type" of application?</h4></div></div></div><p>Even though your app will have a unique combination of target audience, features, UI, and UX, there are still identifiable <span class="emphasis"><em>types</em></span> of applications. It's worth noting that these types don't correspond to the categories in the Google Play store, which is much more specific.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05061_5_1.jpg" alt="Do they use this &quot;type&quot; of application?"/></div><p>
</p><p>Application <span class="emphasis"><em>types</em></span> can be grouped into four categories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Useful tools</strong></span>: These include weather, news, travel, and productivity apps</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Fun tools</strong></span>: Examples include wallpapers, social media, and image editing and photography apps</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Games</strong></span>: This is pretty self-explanatory and Google Play has a dedicated games category, which makes identifying these kind of apps even easier</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Entertainment</strong></span>: This includes music, video, drawing, audio books, podcasts, and comic book apps</li></ul></div><p>There are some crossover and grey areas between categories (for example, is a shopping app a fun tool or a useful tool?), but the more time you spend planning your app and identifying your target audience, the more obvious it'll become which category your app falls into. Our recipe app is a useful tool as it helps students to cook for themselves, potentially for the first time. However if our app contained lots of Christmas-themed recipes and targeted experienced cooks who love baking festive treats, then it's more likely to fall into the fun tool category.</p><p>Identify what type of app you're planning, and identify whether your target audience is likely to use this type of app.</p></div><div class="section" title="Would your target audience be willing to pay for this application?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec13"/>Would your target audience be willing to pay for this application?</h4></div></div></div><p>You may choose to monetize your app in some way. Popular methods include requiring the user to pay a one-time fee before they can download your app; releasing free and paid-for version of the same app; or what sales folk refer to as <span class="emphasis"><em>upsell opportunities</em></span>, which may include unlocking special <span class="emphasis"><em>pro</em></span> features or in-app extras, such as new levels, characters, in-game currency, or extra lives. You may even choose to offer monthly or annual subscriptions.</p><p>If you do choose to monetize your app, then consider what's the most appropriate method for the type of app you're developing for your target audience. For some people on tighter budgets, paying for a mobile app may feel like a waste of money, or a younger target audience may simply not have access to things such as credit and debit cards.</p><p>You should also consider your app's purpose. Part of our recipe app's appeal is that it can save students' money by teaching them how to cook for themselves, rather than relying on takeaways and eating out, so asking them to pay to download our app doesn't really make a lot of sense. What student wants to spend money on an app that's supposed to be <span class="emphasis"><em>saving</em></span> him/her money?</p><p>Another option is to release your app for free, but ask for an optional donation to support your work as an Android developer. This is a popular choice with developers who create apps for more advanced Android users, or users who may also be developers themselves, as they're more likely to appreciate all the hard work that goes into creating a great Android app.</p><p>Another way of monetizing your app is by including adverts, but if you do go down the advertisement route, then make sure they're as unobtrusive as possible. In our recipe app example, adverts may be a viable option, as it doesn't require our cash-conscious students to fork out any money directly.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note44"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Including adverts in your app</strong></span></p><p>If you do decide to include adverts, then this opens up an additional revenue stream: offering to remove the adverts if the user updates to the pro version of your app. However, if you're targeting more advanced mobile users, then you should consider how likely your target audience are to use things such as ad blockers. In this scenario, you might get a better response by requesting an optional donation to support your work as an Android developer.</p></div></div><p>If you do decide to monetize your app, it should always reflect the value your app is offering to your target audience. If your users do decide to invest money in your app, then you should deliver something that's worth their hard-earned cash.</p></div><div class="section" title="Are there enough people in your target audience for your project to be profitable?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl4sec14"/>Are there enough people in your target audience for your project to be profitable?</h4></div></div></div><p>While it's good to be specific, your app has to appeal to enough people to make your project profitable.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note45"/>Note</h3><p>A profitable project isn't necessarily one that earns you money (although that's always nice!) What does success mean to you? It might mean <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> number of people downloading your app, or getting a 3 star+ rating on Google Play.</p></div></div><p>We've decided that our recipe app will target students who are inexperienced cooks and who want access to recipes that are quick, easy, and cheap to make. We could narrow our demographic further by targeting health-conscious students who are interested in recipes that are quick, easy, and cheap but also low-calorie and full of vitamins and minerals. While health-conscious students definitely do exist, this is more of a niche target audience, and if you do decide to go down this route, you should perform some additional market research to find out whether there's actually a significant market for this very specific kind of app.</p><p>Hopefully, after scrutinizing your target audience, you'll come to the conclusion that your target audience <span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> desperately need the kind of app you have in mind. If not, then this is the perfect time to go back to the start of this section and explore whether your initial idea might be better suited to a different target audience.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip46"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Time to get real</strong></span></p><p>For the purposes of this chapter, we created a quick and generalized user persona and some possible use cases. However, when you're creating a real-life Android app, you'll typically want to do some form of market research, which means connecting with the people you're creating your app for and getting their opinion on your project.</p><p>The good news is that if standing in the middle of your local high street with a clipboard is your idea of hell (ditto), then the Internet is an ideal place for market research. Places such as forums and social media can help you connect with the people who might one day be using your app, or you may want to try reaching out to relevant bodies to see whether they're willing to put you in touch with your target audience. In our recipe app example, you could try contacting local universities to see whether they'll help you out with your market research—particularly since you're developing a free app that'll help students overcome the challenge of cooking for themselves for the first time.</p><p>There's no substitute for actual market research, so you should always make the effort to get in contact with your target audience, as their input will be invaluable for helping you create realistic personas and use cases, and it will also help you identify what features your real-life target audience would like to see in your app.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Identifying user and product goals"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec79"/>Identifying user and product goals</h2></div></div></div><p>Goals are one of those things that are so obvious that they're actually easy to overlook. Why are you releasing this app? What's in it for you? And why would someone download your app? These can be difficult questions to answer, but they can also be crucial for the rest of the planning process.</p><p>When you have a set of clearly defined goals, you can refer back to them whenever you're struggling to answer a design-related question. Should you include a <span class="emphasis"><em>share to Facebook</em></span> feature? To find the answer, just consult your goals—how would this feature help your users achieve <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> goals, or help you achieve <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> goals?</p><p>There are two types of goal you need to identify.</p><div class="section" title="Product goals"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec34"/>Product goals</h3></div></div></div><p>It isn't all about the user! Creating an amazing app takes time, effort, and maybe even money, and even if you're creating an app for fun, you should still get something out of it! So, what do you hope to achieve by creating this amazing app?</p><p>Your product goals might include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The number of downloads you want to reach</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The number of reviews you want to get on Google Play</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A minimum star rating on Google Play</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Spreading the word about your company, products, or services</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A financial reward, which may be generated through users upgrading to the pro version of your app, in-app purchases, adverts, or the additional revenue stream of your choice</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="User goals"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec35"/>User goals</h3></div></div></div><p>These are the goals of the people who choose to download and use your app. What are they hoping to achieve? In our recipe app example, one of the main user goals is finding pocket-friendly recipes that don't break the bank.</p><p>At this point, you don't need to define <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> these goals should be accomplished, as there may be multiple ways of achieving the same goal. For instance, we might add a search box to our app's home screen so that the user can filter recipes based on how much the ingredients cost; or you might decide to divide your recipes into categories and then display these categories as tabs along the top of the user's screen—<span class="strong"><strong>Recipes under £1 per head</strong></span>; <span class="strong"><strong>Recipes under £2 per head</strong></span>, and so on.</p><p>For now, concentrate on identifying user goals and leave defining the features needed to accomplish these goals for a later date.</p><p>Sometimes, zeroing in on meaningful user goals might not be straightforward. Maybe you can only think of broad, generalized goals that aren't particularly helpful. For example, imagine you have an idea for a document-editing app you're convinced could be the next Google Drive, but the only goal you can come up with is "I want to be able to create and edit documents." That's not very specific! The key is to take this broad, generalized goal and break it down. How will the user create these documents? What edits might they want to make? And what might they want to do with the finished documents? Brainstorm your answers.</p><p>After a brainstorming session, you should have a list of more specific user goals. In our document-editing app, these might be "I want to be able to..."</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Quickly and easily create a new document, so I can jot down notes on the go</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Make my documents more visually appealing using a range of formatting techniques</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Share my documents with others via social media</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Collaborate on documents with friends and colleagues</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Creating a roadmap"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec80"/>Creating a roadmap</h2></div></div></div><p>A roadmap is the key to getting your app from an initial release to the version you had in mind when you created your ultimate features list at the start of this chapter. In fact, now's the perfect time to take a long, hard look at this list and decide what features should make it into the first version of your app.</p><p>This initial version should include all the features that are necessary to fulfill your app's primary task (imagine releasing a camera app with a bunch of filters but without the functionality needed for taking photos!). It should also include other high-priority features, which will usually be the features that cropped up time and time again during your market research or when you were creating your user personas and use cases.</p><p>If you're unsure whether a feature is important enough to make it into the first version of your app, ask yourself, "Is my app usable without this feature?" The first version of your app should include must-have features <span class="emphasis"><em>only.</em></span>
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note47"/>Note</h3><p>We're talking about the initial <span class="emphasis"><em>version</em></span> of your app and not the initial <span class="emphasis"><em>release</em></span>. This is because you don't necessarily have to release the initial version to the general public.</p></div></div><p>After all the work we've done identifying our target audience, some of the items in your ultimate features list may no longer be relevant, so now's the time to take another look at our list and strike out any unnecessary features.</p><p>You should be left with a list of must-have features that your app can't function without, plus some nice-to-have extras that aren't absolutely necessary but would add value to your app. The latter are the features that are going to form the basis of your roadmap.</p><p>At this point, a roadmap is more of a guideline than a strict schedule, but creating a rough roadmap helps you visualize how your project may evolve over time. It also gives you a rough idea of when you might be ready to release different features.</p><p>To create your roadmap, take your list of nice-to-have features and look for relationships between them. For example, you might group together all features that relate to social media or all the features that allow users to upload their own content.</p><p>You'll typically want to release related features together, so once you've assembled your groups, you should rank them in their order of importance. This is the order in which you'll release these features, so the next step is assigning these groups to different versions of your app; for example, if you decided that social media features are more important than the ability to upload new content, you may want to release these features in version 2.0, while the latter may form the basis of version 3.0.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip48"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Release little and often</strong></span></p><p>Don't be tempted to try and squeeze lots of features into a single release. It's far better to release little and often, rather than including a ton of new features in each update but leaving your users waiting months and months between each release.</p><p>Your typical Android user will quickly forget about an app that's rarely updated. And even if they don't forget about your app, they may still struggle to get to grips with an update that introduces too many changes.</p><p>Releasing little and often also gives you more control over the development process and will make it easier to meet those deadlines. Massive releases are much harder to plan correctly and are notoriously stressful, so do yourself and your users a favor and create a roadmap that includes lots of small, frequent releases.</p></div></div><p>You should also try and add deadlines to your roadmap, even if they're speculative deadlines, as they encourage you to start thinking about how long each feature will take to develop. These deadlines could be vague, such as "in February, I want to release version 1.0," or "I want to release version 2.0 four weeks after 1.0." Alternatively, they might correspond with annual events; for example, if you've developing a shopping app, you may decide to release this app in the run-up to Christmas or during the height of the January sales.</p><p>At the very least, you should set a deadline for when you hope to complete the first version of your app.</p></div><div class="section" title="Some final things to think about"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec81"/>Some final things to think about</h2></div></div></div><p>You've nearly finished planning your app! Before we move onto the design stage, there are a few final bits and bobs to think about.</p><div class="section" title="What devices should you support?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec36"/>What devices should you support?</h3></div></div></div><p>What types of devices should you support? And what versions of Android should your app be compatible with? These are tough questions, and unfortunately, you're going to have to tackle them <span class="emphasis"><em>every time</em></span> you start a new Android project.</p><p>Considering that an Android app will run on any device unless you specifically set it not to, it may be tempting to think, "I'll just wait and see what devices my apps runs okay on", but this is a surefire way of winding up with an app that works well on your typical Android handset but poorly on everything else.</p><p>It's up to you to provide an experience that's optimized for all kinds of tablets, phablets, and Android smartphones held in landscape and portrait mode. Creating an app that functions across a range of devices isn't easy, but the more effort you put into planning how your app will support different devices and screen configurations, the easier this will be to implement. Unless you have a very good reason not to, then now is the time to start thinking about how you're going to support as many different Android devices as possible.</p><p>If you do decide not to support certain devices, then your users will appreciate being told upfront rather than waiting until they launch your app for the first time and discover that it's completely broken on their device. At the very least, be sure to give your users a heads-up about unsupported devices in your app's Google Play description.</p></div><div class="section" title="How should you market your app?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec37"/>How should you market your app?</h3></div></div></div><p>Most of the time, the people you're marketing your app <span class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> will be the same as your target audience, but this might not <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> be the case. For example, if you're developing an educational app to help young children learn their alphabet, this app might be more appealing to parents rather than your target users (and in this instance, children who are still learning to read are unlikely to be scouring Google Play, looking for apps to download).</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Designing your application"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec39"/>Designing your application</h1></div></div></div><p>At this point, you should have a detailed plan about the application want to create. You've completed the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A written concept</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An ultimate features list</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Identified your app's primary task</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Written a product definition statement</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Identified your target audience by creating a user persona and some use cases, and then incorporated this information into your plan</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Started to think about some tricky subjects including monetization, market research, and marketing your app</li></ul></div><p>Now, it's time to begin exploring how your app should look. The idea of designing your application's UI may seem daunting (particularly if you don't have any design experience), but putting extra effort into UI design can transform a good app into a <span class="emphasis"><em>great</em></span> app; and don't we all want to create great applications?</p><p>In the final section of this chapter, I'll show you how to take these first steps to designing an effective and appealing UI.</p><div class="section" title="The high-level flow"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec82"/>The high-level flow</h2></div></div></div><p>The first stage of working out your app's structure is creating a high-level flow. This is where you draw a basic plan of the different routes the user will take through your app in order to accomplish different tasks.</p><p>As you might have already guessed from the name, the most popular way of expressing an app's high-level flow is with a flowchart. How you create this flowchart is up to you. You may want to create a digital chart using your favorite image-editing software, or you might go old school with paper and pencil. Pick whichever method works the best for you.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05061_5_2.jpg" alt="The high-level flow"/></div><p>
</p><p>You'll typically represent screens with shapes, and express navigation using lines or arrows. You may also want to number the screens in your flowchart, particularly if you're plotting out a large number of screens. This way, when it's time to create a wireframe, you can number the screens in your wireframe to correspond with the screens in your flowchart.</p><p>It's never too early to start looking for ways to improve the user experience, and one of the easiest ways of gauging your app's UX at this early stage is to look at how many interactions the user has to perform in order to complete different tasks.</p><p>Your flowchart is<span class="emphasis"><em> ideal</em></span> for identifying any opportunities to minimize or simplify the number of steps required to complete each task, whether that means removing screens, reordering screens, or changing your app's navigation. For example, you may decide to include a menu on Screen A, so the user can jump directly to Screen E and Screen F.</p><p>You should also identify which screen should be your app's main or home screen. A home screen should help users complete your app's primary task. Since our recipe app is designed to help users locate recipes that are quick, cheap, and easy to make, we may decide to select the <span class="strong"><strong>Search for recipes</strong></span> screen as our home screen.</p><p>This flowchart is also the perfect opportunity to identify any areas where you might overwhelm the user with too many options. If you're going to include a search box on the home screen, is it wise to display all the user's saved recipes, plus the app's main <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> on that home screen too? You may decide to move some of this content to a different screen, or temporarily hide it in a side-menu or separate tab.</p><p>Alternatively, you may decide that if you design your app carefully enough, you can get away with displaying all this content on a single screen without overwhelming the user. If you opt for the latter, then make a note that you should devote some extra time to this screen, just to ensure the user experience really is as straightforward as possible.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip49"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Be a critic</strong></span></p><p>While working on your high-level workflow, it may help to take a critical look at how other apps handle the challenge of getting users from the first screen to their desired location with as little friction as possible.</p><p>Take a look through the apps installed on your Android device, and if there's an app you particularly like, make a quick flowchart for this app. Try to identify why this flow works so well. It may also help to sketch the flow of an app you're not so keen on, and then try to work out why this flow doesn't work for you. These exercises will help you get into the habit of being critical about application flow, which is essential if you're going to effectively analyze and refine your own app's flowchart.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Creating a screen list"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec83"/>Creating a screen list</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you've created a high-level flow, make a list of all the screens you'll need to create if the user is going to be able to accomplish their various tasks and goals.</p><p>The screen list for our recipe app will look something like this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Home screen</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A list of categories</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A list of recipes for a given category</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A list of saved recipes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Detailed recipe view</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Search box</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Search results</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Creating a screen map"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec84"/>Creating a screen map</h2></div></div></div><p>Now it's time to combine our flowchart and screen list, and create a screen map that expresses the navigational relationships between all the different screens that make up our app.</p><p>If in doubt, refer back to your flowchart and review the different paths the user might take through your app.</p><p>Here is an example of how the screen map for our recipe app might look:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05061_5_3.jpg" alt="Creating a screen map"/></div><p>
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note50"/>Note</h3><p>One screen doesn't necessarily equate to one activity. One screen might also equate to one fragment that's displayed as a part of a multi-pane layout.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Grouping screens into multi-pane layouts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec38"/>Grouping screens into multi-pane layouts</h3></div></div></div><p>We didn't design our screen map with any particular Android device in mind, but Android apps must be flexible enough to adapt to a wide range of different devices, from small handsets right through to large tablets.</p><p>To present content to your users in the most effective way, you may want to group related screens together. You can then present these <span class="strong"><strong>fragments</strong></span> in different combinations, depending on the user's device and screen configuration.</p><p>Smaller screens are generally only suitable for displaying one pane of content at a time, so each screen in our map will typically equate to one screen on a smaller device.</p><p>However, sometimes they'll be more on-screen space available, for example, when a user is viewing your app on a tablet, phablet, or even on an Android smartphone held in landscape mode. When there's more space available, your app should take full advantage, and one way to do this is using fragments.</p><p>Fragments help you create an app that can adapt across a range of different device types, screen sizes, and screen orientations. Combining screens into multi-pane layouts also helps to minimize the number of interactions users have to perform in order to complete each task.</p><p>How might we group the different screens in our recipe app, so we can effectively display multiple fragments in a multi-pane layout <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> a single fragment in a single-pane layout?</p><p>On a smaller screen, we might want to display the recipe app's home screen as a single, standalone fragment. However, if the user is viewing our app on a larger screen, then what other information might it make sense to display alongside the home screen fragment?</p><p>Let's run through all the tasks the user might want to perform when they're located on the home screen. They might want to perform the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Access a list of categories</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Access their saved recipes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Perform a search</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Access a recipe</li></ul></div><p>Allowing the user to perform any of these tasks from the home screen would add value, but I'm going to go with <span class="emphasis"><em>Perform a search</em></span> as I feel this is the most common task users will want to perform in our recipe app. So, on a smaller screen, I want the user to see the home screen; but on a larger device, I want the user to see the home screen fragment <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the search fragment in a multi-pane layout.</p><p>Work your way through your screen map, and look for any additional ways of grouping your screens into multi-pane layouts for users accessing your app on larger devices.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note51"/>Note</h3><p>When you're displaying multiple panes of content, the accepted convention is to arrange your content from left to right in increasing detailed order.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Navigation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec85"/>Navigation</h2></div></div></div><p>Your app's navigation should feel intuitive and effortless, to the point where even new users should be able to navigate around your app with ease. Since you've already created a screen map, determining your app's navigation should be a doddle.</p><p>It should be easy to navigate to the most important destinations within your app; for example, in our recipe app, the home screen will be the most prominent and accessible screen.</p><p>When you prioritize a screen by placing it higher in the navigational hierarchy, this screen is called a <span class="strong"><strong>parent</strong></span>. The less important screens, which you typically place beneath a parent screen, are referred to as <span class="strong"><strong>children</strong></span>. Continuing this theme, screens that have the same parent are known as siblings, and they usually have equal priority. You may also hear the term <span class="emphasis"><em>collections</em></span>, which is sometimes used to refer to multiple screens that share the same parent.</p><p>Navigation can be broken into the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Descendent navigation</strong></span>: When the user navigates deeper into your application, they're descending from a higher level of hierarchy to a lower level of hierarchy. Moving from a parent to a child screen is an example of descending navigation.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Lateral navigation</strong></span>: This is where the user moves between sibling screens.</li></ul></div><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05061_5_4.jpg" alt="Navigation"/></div><p>
</p><p>To help you determine the type of navigation that best suits your app, ask yourself the following.</p><div class="section" title="What are your app's most important tasks?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec39"/>What are your app's most important tasks?</h3></div></div></div><p>Identify all the tasks users might want to perform, and then assign a priority level to each of these tasks. You should make it easy for users to accomplish high-priority tasks by featuring them prominently in your app's navigation hierarchy. For instance, if you're designing a music app, you should make it easy for users to play music (a high-priority task) while lower-priority tasks, such as being able to tweet a link to the song you're currently listening to, can be placed lower in the navigational hierarchy.</p></div><div class="section" title="Are there any tasks you can group together?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec40"/>Are there any tasks you can group together?</h3></div></div></div><p>You should create some form of navigational relationship between related features; for example, you could include them in the same menu, in the same screen, or in a row of tabs within the same parent screen.</p><p>In our music app example, being able to search for more albums by a particular artist, taking a peek at this week's top 10 tracks, browsing new releases, and checking what tracks your friends are currently listening to are all features that help you discover new music, so you might decide to place them together in your app's navigational structure.</p></div><div class="section" title="Is my navigation consistent?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec41"/>Is my navigation consistent?</h3></div></div></div><p>Consistency is crucial. Even if you design your navigation to be as simple as possible, if the navigation varies from one screen to the next, then you're going to end up with some seriously frustrated and confused users.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Common navigation patterns"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec86"/>Common navigation patterns</h2></div></div></div><p>When planning your app's navigation, you should focus on how to best meet the needs of your target audience and the tasks they'll want to perform in your application. However, there are some common navigation patterns that can give you a head start in crafting a unique navigation structure that suits your particular application.</p><div class="section" title="The embedded navigation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec42"/>The embedded navigation</h3></div></div></div><p>If your app has a simple structure, you may choose to embed navigation inside your content. The major drawback is that embedding navigation in this way does reduce the space available to display your application's content, so it may not be ideal for devices with smaller screens.</p></div><div class="section" title="Buttons and simple targets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec43"/>Buttons and simple targets</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the most straightforward navigation patterns is to include touchable targets, such as buttons in your app's parent screen. When the user taps one of these targets, a child screen opens, which may contain further touchable targets.</p><p>This kind of navigation is easy to understand, but be aware that including lots of touchable targets on a single screen can make your app difficult to navigate on smaller devices.</p></div><div class="section" title="Lists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec44"/>Lists</h3></div></div></div><p>If you need to display lots of text, then vertically scrolling lists (such as the classic, text-based menu) can provide a straightforward way of navigating your app.</p><p>Just be wary of creating a navigational hierarchy where lists lead to more lists, as this type of navigation can cause the number of touches required to complete each task to spiral out of control.</p></div><div class="section" title="Grids, cards, and carousels"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec45"/>Grids, cards, and carousels</h3></div></div></div><p>When you need to display lots of visual content, such as videos or photos, you may want to use vertically scrolling grids of items, horizontally scrolling carousels, or cards:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05061_5_5.jpg" alt="Grids, cards, and carousels"/><div class="caption">An example of grid-based navigation</div></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Tabs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec46"/>Tabs</h3></div></div></div><p>Although Android's traditional navigation model is hierarchical (moving from parent screens to child screens), there are some instances where a horizontal navigation may make more sense, particularly if your app features lots of sibling screens.</p><p>Tabs are one common examples of horizontal navigation. If your app includes lots of grouped content, sibling screens, and categorized data sets or content that's equally important, then tabs are an ideal form of navigation as they allow you to embed multiple screens in a single parent container. Tabs give the user a way of accessing all this content directly without them having to navigate back to the parent view every time they want to access a different sibling screen.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05061_5_6.jpg" alt="Tabs"/></div><p>
</p><p>Tabs are also a useful way of ensuring that users are aware of all your app's sibling screens. With tabs, users don't need to go exploring any hidden menus as all your app's sibling screens are lined up along the top of the screen.</p><p>If you do opt for tab-based navigation, there are several best practices you should keep in mind:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Whenever the user selects a tab, new content may appear but the tabs themselves should remain constant.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Tab labels should consist of either icons or text only. If you do opt for text labels, you should keep them as short as possible.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Don't treat switching between tabs as history. If the user switches from tab A to tab B, pressing their device's <span class="strong"><strong>Back</strong></span> button <span class="emphasis"><em>shouldn't</em></span> take them back to tab A.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Arrange tabs horizontally along the top of the screen as a single row. Tabs should never run along the bottom of the screen. If you do want to display actions along the bottom of the screen, use a split action bar instead.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Reserve swipe gestures for navigating between tabs. Don't include any in-tab content that supports swipe gestures, as your users may end up swiping between tabs by accident.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Don't include further tabbed content inside a tab. Remember that movie Inception? No one wants a <span class="emphasis"><em>tab-ception</em></span>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you suspect your users are likely to keep switching between tabs in order to compare their content, then this is a sign that you should combine your content into fewer tabs. Or perhaps, tabs aren't the right navigational solution for your app after all?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Tabs are great for displaying multiple sibling views, but you should limit tabs to no more than four per parent screen. If you do need to display more than four sibling views, then once again, tabs might not be right for your particular app.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Horizontal paging (swipe views)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl3sec47"/>Horizontal paging (swipe views)</h3></div></div></div><p>Horizontal paging is another popular method of navigating between sibling screens, and is sometimes known as <span class="emphasis"><em>swipe views</em></span>. Like tabs, horizontal paging is useful when your app features multiple sibling screens.</p><p>As you might have guessed from the name, swipe views are a form of navigation where one screen is displayed at a time, and the user navigates between the screen's siblings using a <span class="emphasis"><em>swipe-from-the-right</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>swipe-from-the-left</em></span> gesture.</p><p>Horizontal paging works the best when your app has a small number of sibling screens, and there's an ordered relationship between those screens; for example, calendar apps typically use horizontal paging for navigating between different months.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="The social layer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec87"/>The social layer</h2></div></div></div><p>In our recipe app, we briefly touched on the idea of letting users share their favorite recipes with friends and family via social media. Even simple social features like this can add real value to an application, so it's worth considering whether your app might benefit from a few social features. At the very least, giving your users the option to share your app's content via social media is a quick and easy way of promoting your application.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note52"/>Note</h3><p>Adding a social aspect to your app isn't mandatory! You should only include social features if they add value to your app in some way; not <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> application has to have a social aspect.</p></div></div><p>When you're deciding whether to include a social layer ask yourself the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What would your users get out of the proposed social features?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How would a social layer enhance the user experience?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What specific social features might add the most value for your target audience?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What social features might help to create a sense of community?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How much effort would the proposed social features require from the user? What are the potential rewards? Are these features <span class="emphasis"><em>worth it</em></span> from the user's perspective?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What are the advantages of adding a social layer to your app?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What are the potential disadvantages?</li></ul></div><p>When you think about social features, chances that are social media apps, such as Facebook and Twitter, immediately spring to mind. However, there are a multitude of ways of subtly integrating social features into your app without turning it into a social <span class="emphasis"><em>media</em></span> app.</p><p>Some examples of non-social media apps that have an effective social aspect are Google Calendar and Spotify.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05061_5_7.jpg" alt="The social layer"/></div><p>
</p><p>Whenever you create a new event in Google Calendar, the app prompts you to dip into your device's <span class="strong"><strong>Contacts</strong></span> and invite friends, family, work colleagues, and other contacts to your event. Each contact can then either accept or decline this invitation, and you get the added security of knowing that everyone who accepts your invite will receive automatic Google Calendar reminders as your event draws near.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B05061_5_8.jpg" alt="The social layer"/></div><p>
</p><p>Spotify uses social features to help you find new tracks to listen to. If you open Spotify and navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Activity</strong></span>, you'll find a list of all the music your Spotify friends have been listening to, and if you don't have any Spotify buddies, the app will suggest a few people for you to follow.</p></div></div>
