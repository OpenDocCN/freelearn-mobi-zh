  <p>In <a class="link" href="" title="Chapter 7. Tailoring Your Personal Android System">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Tailoring Your Personal Android System</em>, you learned how to add the final personal touch to your custom Android system. You customized both the application layer and the system layer: new menus, new apps, and new daemons.</p>

  <p>In this chapter, we are going even further: we are going <em>outside</em> the smartphone, connecting to external microcontrollers, sensors, and different devices. We will see how our whole world could be connected and interactive with Android.</p>

  <p>You will learn about Android ADK and Arduino, and how Google is filling our lives with Android-oriented devices: from Chromecast devices to Android Auto, from smart watches to Internet of Things.</p>

  <p>More than ten years ago, in a bar in a small Italian town, a group of students and researchers created a low-cost microcontroller that would revolutionize the world of DIY (Do It Yourself)—<strong>Arduino</strong>, shown in the next image:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_131.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_131" style="max-width:1000px;max-height:713px"/></div>

  <p>The latest version of Ardunio (or Genuino, for the non-USA market) is called Arduino <strong>UNO</strong>. <strong>Uno</strong> means <em>one</em> in Italian and this codename celebrates the first stable version of the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that comes with the board itself. This board is based on ATmega328P by Atmel and provides a set of controllable input/output pins. It can work as a standalone microcontroller, once it has been properly programmed, and can be used via its USB connection.</p>

  <p>The greatest feature of Arduino is its open nature: everything, from the hardware schematics to the development IDE, has been open source since day one. This openness, and the extensible design of the board, allowed manufactures and advanced users to create an infinite number of so-called <strong>shields</strong>:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_132.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_132" style="max-width:600px;max-height:450px"/></div>

  <p>An Arduino shield is a separate component that can be attached to Arduino to enhance it and to add new features. The previous image shows how Arduino shields can be stacked to create a totally new and customized device. Common examples of Arduino shields are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Ethernet Shield, which gives Arduino the ability to communicate with the outside world via an Internet connection.</li>

    <li>The Proto Shield, which can be used to make a <em>permanent</em> version of a prototype that you created with a breadboard.</li>

    <li>The Relay Shield, which enables Arduino to pilot high-voltage circuits. This is crucial for home automation when you need to turn lights or appliances on and off.</li>

    <li>The Display Shield, which gives Arduino a visual way to communicate with the outside world.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Since Arduino came out, it has gained more and more fans and passionate developers, thanks to its easy interface and the extremely flat learning curve. Today, software developers without hardware or electronics knowledge can create projects that live outside their computers and can interact with the external world. To take advantage of these possibilities, in 2012 Google created the Android ADK.</p>

  <h3 class="Title-2 sigil_not_in_toc">Android ADK</h3>

  <p>Android Accessory Development Kit is the reference implementation for the Android Open Accessory device. At Google I/O, in 2012 Google provided Android Accessory Development Kits to developers and provided manufacturers with clear specifications for creating their own kit, external accessory devices for Android. One of these certified devices is the Arduino itself, but thanks to the open nature of the whole project, you could build a compatible device yourself.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Android ADK never really <em>boomed</em> among developers. Of course, you can find lots of interesting projects on the web about connecting an Android smartphone to an Arduino, like the one by TCRobotics at <a class="ulink" href="http://blog.bricogeek.com/noticias/arduino/el-adk-de-google-en-un-arduino-uno">http://blog.bricogeek.com/noticias/arduino/el-adk-de-google-en-un-arduino-uno</a>. This is surely one of our favorites; it shows the great potential, but also the big sacrifice, of keeping an Android smartphone <strong>wired</strong> to a cable the whole time:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_133.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_133" style="max-width:562px;max-height:391px"/></div>

  <p>Luckily for us, there are much cooler ways to use Android ADK to play around with sensors and electronics.</p>

  <h3 class="Title-2 sigil_not_in_toc">Using UDOO as an all-in-one ADK device</h3>

  <p>As you already know, UDOO can run Android. What you probably don't know is that it comes with an Arduino on it. Yes, both Android and Arduino are on the same board! When you think that you can connect a touchscreen, or even a mouse and keyboard to UDOO, you soon start fantasizing about all those geeky projects of yours becoming reality.</p>

  <h4 class="Title-3 sigil_not_in_toc">Getting ready</h4>

  <p>To start playing with Arduino, you just need to set up UDOO and connect the Android part to the SAM3X (Arduino-compatible) part. The following images show an UDOO, as seen from above. On the left, jumper 18 is highlighted. This jumper must be unplugged to enable the SAM3X. On the right, the USB port you are going to connect to is highlighted as well:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_134.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_134" style="max-width:900px;max-height:331px"/></div>

  <p>Once the board is ready, you can move to the software part.</p>

  <h4 class="Title-3 sigil_not_in_toc">Flashing the Arduino board</h4>

  <p>For this quick example, we are going to command an LED connected to the UDOO. The LED will be connected to input 13 of the UDOO board. Every LED has two pins; the longer one is the anode and has to be connected to input 13, and the shorter one is the cathode and has to be connected to ground, the unnumbered input on the left of input 13:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_135.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_135" style="max-width:600px;max-height:800px"/></div>

  <p>The electronics setup is in place. Let's download the Arduino IDE from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.udoo.org/other-resources/">http://www.udoo.org/other-resources/</a>.</p>

  <p>The first time you run the Arduino IDE, you will be presented with an empty project file:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_136.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_136" style="max-width:530px;max-height:631px"/></div>

  <p>This empty Arduino sketch gives you a skeleton structure for our Arduino program:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <code class="literal">setup</code> method that runs once and gets everything in place for the second method</li>

    <li>A <code class="literal">loop</code> method that keeps on running over and over until the board is turned off</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To properly connect and program our Arduino, we need to select the board type and port. From the Arduino IDE Tools menu, select <strong>Board</strong> <em>|</em> <strong>Arduino Due (Programming Port)</strong>:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_137.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_137" style="max-width:688px;max-height:575px"/></div>

  <p>The previous image shows the amount of different Arduino boards that are available on the market nowadays. UDOO is compatible with the Arduino Due, so we are choosing that board model. Once we have selected the proper board, we need to select the <strong>Port</strong> to use to connect to the UDOO:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_138.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_138" style="max-width:690px;max-height:257px"/></div>

  <p>As you can see in the image, the port name could be slightly different on different computers. The previous image shows a common configuration for an Apple MacBook Pro.</p>

  <p>Once the IDE has been properly configured, we can start with the source code, as follows:</p>
  <pre>#include "variant.h"
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;adk.h&gt;

#define  LED_PIN  13

// Accessory descriptor. It's how Arduino identifies itself to Android.
char descriptionName[] = "ArduinoADK"; 
char modelName[] = "UDOO_ADK";           // Arduino Accessory name (Need to be the same defined in the Android App)
char manufacturerName[] = "Packt";     // Manufacturer (Need to be the same defined in the Android App)

char versionNumber[] = "1.0";            // version (Need to be the same defined in the Android App)
char serialNumber[] = "1";
char url[] = "http://www.packtpub.com";      // If there isn't any compatible app installed, Android suggest to visit this url

USBHost Usb;
ADK adk(&amp;Usb, manufacturerName, modelName, descriptionName, versionNumber, url, serialNumber);

#define RCVSIZE 128
uint8_t buf[RCVSIZE];
uint32_t bytesRead = 0;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);   
    pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
    delay(500);
    Serial.println("Starting...");
}

void loop() {
    Usb.Task();
     
    if (adk.isReady()) {
      adk.read(&amp;bytesRead, RCVSIZE, buf);// read data into buf variable
      if (bytesRead &gt; 0) {
        if (parseCommand(buf[0]) == 1) {// compare received data
          // Received "1" - turn on LED
          digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
        } else if (parseCommand(buf[0]) == 0) {
          // Received "0" - turn off LED
          digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); 
        }  
      }
    } else {
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN , LOW); // turn off light
    }  
    
    delay(10);
}

// the characters sent to Arduino are interpreted as ASCII, we decrease 48 to return to ASCII range.
uint8_t parseCommand(uint8_t received) {
  return received - 48;
}</pre>

  <p>We can quickly analyze the source code and can find out that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We are specifying PIN number 13</li>

    <li>We are specifying the model name, manufacturer name, and version number that will identify our board once we connect it to Android</li>

    <li>We are configuring the serial connection</li>

    <li>We are listening for incoming data on the serial connection and reacting accordingly:



      <ul>
        <li>turn on the LED if we received 1</li>

        <li>turn off the LED if we received 0</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once the source code is in place, you can flash it to the Arduino using the IDE <strong>File</strong> | <strong>Upload</strong> menu.</p>

  <h4 class="Title-3 sigil_not_in_toc">Creating the Android app</h4>

  <p>The Android app will be super simple: a toggle button to turn the LED ON and OFF. You can create the initial app using the Android Studio wizard, creating an empty <code class="literal">Activity</code> to get things started. Once the skeleton is in place, you need to add a new dependency to your <code class="literal">build.gradle</code>:</p>
  <pre>dependencies {
    compile 'me.palazzetti:adktoolkit:0.3.0'
}</pre>

  <p>Emanuele Palazzetti, author of <em>Getting started with UDOO</em> by <em>Packt Publishing</em>, released a handy Android library, ADK Toolkit (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/palazzem/adk-toolkit">https://github.com/palazzem/adk-toolkit</a>), for easier communication between your Android apps and your Android ADK device, and we are going to take full advantage of this library.</p>

  <p>You need to add some specific configurations in your Android Manifest. In your <code class="literal">&lt;activity&gt;</code> tag, add the following lines:</p>
  <pre>&lt;intent-filter&gt;
  &lt;action android:name="android.hardware.usb.action.USB_ACCESSORY_ATTACHED"/&gt;
&lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;meta-data
  android:name="android.hardware.usb.action.USB_ACCESSORY_ATTACHED"
  android:resource="@xml/accessory_filter"/&gt;</pre>

  <p>As you will have noted, the <code class="literal">&lt;meta-data&gt;</code> tag refers to an XML resource, named <code class="literal">accessory_filter</code>. Right now, it's missing. Let's create a <code class="literal">accessory_filter.xml</code> in the <code class="literal">src/res/xml/</code> folder:</p>
  <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;resources&gt;
  &lt;usb-accessory
    manufacturer="Packt"
    model="UDOO_ADK"
    version="1.0"/&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;</pre>

  <p>This is the exact information we added to the Arduino sketch and will allow Android to properly identify our board.</p>

  <p>Setup is over. Let's move on to the UI of our app. Having followed the wizard, you now have a single <code class="literal">Activity</code> with its own layout; chances are that its name is <code class="literal">main.xml</code> and it's located in <code class="literal">src/res/layout</code>. Once you have located the layout, we can add our button:</p>
  <pre>&lt;ToggleButton 
 android:id="@+id/toggleButtonLED"
 android:textOn="Turn OFF" 
 android:textOff="Turn ON" 
 android:layout_width="500dp" 
 android:layout_height="200dp" 
 android:layout_centerVertical="true" 
 android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
 android:textSize="50sp"
 android:onClick="blinkLED"/&gt;</pre>

  <p>It's pretty straightforward: an ID, a couple of labels, and an <code class="literal">onClick</code> method to trigger when the button is tapped.</p>

  <p>The method referred by the <code class="literal">onClick</code> will be placed into our <code class="literal">Activity</code>:</p>
  <pre>public void blinkLED(View v) {
    if (buttonLED.isChecked()) {
        adkManager.write("1");
    } else {
        adkManager.write("0");
    }
}</pre>

  <p>When the button is clicked, we send <code class="literal">1</code> if it's ON, or <code class="literal">0</code> if it's OFF. Fair enough, but where do we send this data? What's that <code class="literal">adkManager</code>?</p>

  <p>The <code class="literal">adkManager</code> module comes with the ADK Toolkit. We create it and set it up in our <code class="literal">Activity</code>. This is the final result:</p>
  <pre>public class UDOOBlinkLEDActivity extends Activity {

    private ToggleButton buttonLED;

    private AdkManager adkManager;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);
        buttonLED = (ToggleButton) findViewById(R.id.toggleButtonLED);

        adkManager = new AdkManager(this);
        registerReceiver(adkManager.getUsbReceiver(), adkManager.getDetachedFilter());
    }

    @Override
    public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        adkManager.open();
    }

    @Override
    public void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        adkManager.close();
    }

    public void blinkLED(View v) {
        if (buttonLED.isChecked()) {
            adkManager.write("1");
        } else {
            adkManager.write("0");
        }
    }
}</pre>

  <p>Finally, our app is completed. Just upload it to our UDOO and you will have a huge button to turn your LED ON and OFF:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_139.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_139" style="max-width:427px;max-height:821px"/></div>
</div>

		    <div><div><h2 class="Title-1">Exploring the possibilities of the Internet of Things</h2>

  <p>Knowing that your favorite OS can run on thousands of devices, in hundreds of different customizations, and communicate with any kind of device, both wired or wireless, opens up incredible possibilities.</p>

  <h3 class="Title-2 sigil_not_in_toc">Android Auto</h3>

  <p>In 2014, Google presented Android Auto, an innovative project that aims to command an Android system using the controls already available in our cars:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_140.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_140" style="max-width:602px;max-height:362px"/></div>

  <p>In 2015, the first version of Android Auto was released and the developer community started to really look into it. In 2016, dozens of car manufacturers are going to release models with integrated Android Auto support.</p>

  <p>The idea behind Android Auto is to support driving safety and provide users with an alternative way to access their devices when they are driving. To achieve this goal, Google engineers worked with car manufacturers to create a bridge between our Android devices and car dashboards.</p>

  <p>Car dashboards and controls represent the top of the user experience and interaction we can possibly have while driving. Everything is placed specifically to be accessible, everything is designed specifically to be easy to use, and everything is created to be effective and powerful, but not distracting.</p>

  <p>These constraints forced Google to rethink their popular apps for this new challenge. When you connect your Android smartphone to an Android Auto-ready car, you can enjoy a different OS user interface, tailored for this particular scenario. The next image shows the Google Maps interface for Android Auto:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_141.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_141" style="max-width:602px;max-height:362px"/></div>

  <p>The next image shows the Google Play Music user interface, once we connect our device to an Android Auto-compatible car:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_142.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_142" style="max-width:602px;max-height:362px"/></div>

  <p>Popular apps such as Google Maps or Google Play Music evolve into a more effective design and take full advantage of the dashboard's bigger screen and wheel controls.</p>

  <p>From a developer perspective, Android Auto comes with an obvious question:</p>

  <div><blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p><em>Do I need a car to develop and test my apps?</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Fortunately, Google provides testing tools for those who want to approach Android Auto: the <strong>Desktop Head Unit</strong> (<strong>DHU</strong>). Available with the Android SDK, the DHU runs on your computer and allows your computer to act as a car dashboard. The following images show how the smartphone switches to Android Auto mode and the UI switches to DHU:</p>

    <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_143.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_143" style="max-width:263px;max-height:486px"/></div>

    <p>The previous image is an example of how the smartphone display will look once we connect it to the car—it turns black and shows the Android Auto logo. The next image shows how the car dashboard becomes active when we connect the smartphone. The car dashboard turns into the Android Auto user interface and, in this example, shows a few Google Now cards, with traffic and weather information:</p>

    <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_144.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_144" style="max-width:434px;max-height:274px"/></div>

    <h3 class="Title-2 sigil_not_in_toc">Android Wear</h3>

    <p>While we wait for Android Auto-enabled cars to invade our lives, we can direct our attention to Android Wear.</p>

    <p>In 2014, Google announced a particular version of Android, specifically designed and developed for smart watches. Started as a customization of Android 5.0 Lollipop, Android Wear is currently based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.</p>

    <p>Android Wear aims to enhance the way users can interact with the world every day. An Android Wear smart watch connects to an Android smartphone and provides quicker access to notifications, messages, and every possible type of content that can be enjoyed in a better way without interacting with the smartphone itself:</p>

    <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_145.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_145" style="max-width:600px;max-height:450px"/></div>

    <p>Smart watches like the one in the previous picture provide integrations with dozens of services, such as Google Fit, Endomondo, and IFTTT. They have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, GPS, and accelerometers. This huge range of possibilities pushed the Android community to experiment and create solutions for dozens of scenarios.</p>

    <p>With the support of Android SDK and the Android community, in the last two years we have seen an increasing number of apps tailored for smart watches—we can turn on our Philips Hue lights with our watch, we can turn off our Google Nest with our watch, and we can know the state of our plants thanks to Parrot Flower Power.</p>

    <p>Continuing on this path will take us straight to the next section.</p>
  </div>
</div>

		    <div><div><h2 class="Title-1">Domotics</h2>

  <p>We are living in a world where lots of devices, appliances, and "things" that were <em>disconnected</em> are now part of a growing ecosystem of interconnected devices. We came from a past where computation could happen only in our computers—we are living in a present where computation happens in our pockets, with our smartphone. We are moving toward a future where computation will happen everywhere: a watch, a car, a drone, a house, a garden, and much more.</p>

  <p>We had thermostats that had to be commanded manually and we have intelligent thermostats now, such as Google Nest, that learn from our habits and react accordingly to create a better and more effective user experience:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_146.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_146" style="max-width:700px;max-height:467px"/></div>

  <p>We had lights that needed a wall switch to be turned ON and OFF and now we have intelligent lights, such as Philips Hue, that can be controlled via smartphone or even smart watch. These lights can turn ON automatically the moment we approach our home, taking advantage of concepts such as geo-fencing. We have light that can interconnect with other devices, such as smart door bells, and can create a visual trigger for hearing-impaired users:</p>

  <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_147.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_147" style="max-width:799px;max-height:702px"/></div>

  <p>We have plant sensors, such as Parrot Flower Power, that can show a notification on our smartphone and let us know that our plants need water. Knowing that, even if we are thousands of kilometers away from home on some remote beach, enjoying our holidays, we can remotely command a Belkin WeMo Switch to turn on our irrigation system and water our plants.</p>

  <p>We have smart refrigerators, such as the Samsung Family Hub, that are connected to the Internet and allow you to actually <em>see</em> inside your refrigerator to check whether the orange juice for tomorrow's breakfast is missing. They are becoming so interconnected that the Korean version will be aware of possible discounts for your favorite products and suggests which particular supermarket you have to check to save some money.</p>

  <p>We have smart mirrors, such as the one by Hannah Mittelstaedt (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror">https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror</a>), which can be easily created with one of your old Android devices. Give your obsolete tablet a new life and a new purpose. It could give you weather forecast, the latest news, your plants' status, traffic information, or whatever useful information you would like to have while you are brushing your teeth in the morning.</p>

  <p>We have smart coffee machines, such as the <strong>Nespresso Prodigio</strong>, that can give us the current status of the water level, coffee capsules remaining, and maintenance necessary. The coffee machines can be controlled remotely, from your couch, and for the first time in our history, the classic joke is not a joke anymore; our Android phone can actually make us a coffee!</p>

  <div><blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p><em>Once humanity satisfied every basic need, it started fighting boredom!</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Okay, probably that's too much drama, but we are entering the entertaining section, so let's talk about having some fun!</p>

    <h3 class="Title-2 sigil_not_in_toc">Multimedia</h3>

    <p>Entertainment is a huge market and Google jumped into it pretty quickly with its Nexus Player and its Chromecast devices:</p>

    <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_148.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_148" style="max-width:790px;max-height:488px"/></div>

    <p>The previous image shows the latest model of Google Chromecast. When Google approached this market, they decided to provide users with a device that was as easy as possible to set up. Google Chromecast has one HDMI connector and a USB power cable; that's it. You connect the HDMI to your TV, connect the power supply, and your TV can now connect to your smart phone.</p>

    <p>Your smartphone becomes your remote and, with a few clicks, you can start streaming any multimedia content you want, straight to your TV: your preferred YouTube channels, your preferred movies from Google Play Store, your music from Google Play Music and hundreds of third-party apps can be sources of content.</p>

    <p>If you don't like TV and you are a music addict, Google has you covered with Chromecast Audio:</p>

    <div><img class="width50" src="img/epub_36702041_149.jpeg" data-src="img/epub_36702041_149" style="max-width:600px;max-height:309px"/></div>

    <p>As for the Chromecast, Chromecast Audio is very easy to connect to your Hi-Fi system and it's easy to set up via the Chromecast app you can install on your Android smartphone.</p>

    <p>One of the key features is that it has a standalone Wi-Fi connection via your home Wi-Fi system, so that it can be instructed to reproduce your music instead of requiring your phone to stream the music to the Chromecast Audio. You control it using your smartphone, but there is no battery drain, because there is no persistent Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection between your phone and your Chromecast Audio.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, when we think about Android-powered toys, we can only think about drones!</p>

    <p>The first and most popular, the Parrot ARDrone in the previous picture, set the bar and drove the market for quite a while. Over time, lots of commercial alternatives showed up, but, as with the smart mirror, the RC toys community also went full Do-It-Yourself.</p>

    <p>During Droidcon Turin 2015 Hackaton, we demonstrated how you could build an RC car, powered by UDOO, controlled via Wi-Fi using an Android device… in 24 hours: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.hackster.io/team-dronix-alter-ego/dronixcar-37b81a?f=1#">https://www.hackster.io/team-dronix-alter-ego/dronixcar-37b81a?f=1#</a>:</p>

    <p>The RC car was equipped with a video camera, streaming in real time to the smartphone. The smartphone acted as video consumer and remote controller.</p>

    <p>The whole project was released as open source, in the classic Android/Linux tradition.</p>

  <p>Our journey is over! It's been quite a rollercoaster, from the history of the operating system to how it can equip devices ready to communicate with the external world. You learned how to retrieve the source code for your devices, how to navigate the source folder tree, and how to create the perfect setup to properly build a vanilla Android system.</p>

  <p>You stepped up and started to add customizations to your system, to enrich the user experience, to improve the performance, and to add support for your own hardware. You went deep into the boot sequence's inner structure to customize the system even more. You swam back to the surface to customize the highest part of the architecture pyramid, the user interface, to provide your users with the ultimate customized Android system.</p>

  <p>Finally, you saw how easy it is to step away from the Android device itself and find a whole world of devices waiting to communicate and interact, powered by the awesome Android platform.</p>

  <p>Our journey is over, but your own has just started! Master what you learned, experiment, try out your ideas, fail, learn more, try again, and finally succeed!</p>

  <p>Android is an awesome tool; you can use it to make your craziest ideas become a reality!</p>
