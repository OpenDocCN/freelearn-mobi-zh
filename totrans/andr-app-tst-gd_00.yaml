    of the software development process and a technique where you will tackle bugs
    early on. From the most basic unit tests applied to a sample project to more sophisticated
    performance tests, this book provides a detailed description of the most widely
    used techniques in the Android testing world in a recipe-based approach.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, you need practical Android development experience as we are not
    covering the basics. It is assumed that you already have some Android application
    or at least you are familiar with the topics described extensively in the Android
    Dev Guide ([http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html](http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html)).
    Also it is very helpful having followed some of the Sample Code projects ([http://developer.android.com/resources/browser.html?tag=sample](http://developer.android.com/resources/browser.html?tag=sample)),
    probably starting with API Demos and then moving to other more involved topics.
    This way you will get the most of this book.
