- en: Technology is advancing quite rapidly. Portable devices, such as media players,
    smartphones, and tablets, have brought huge advancements and changes in the way
    people communicate, share, and consume digital content. Developers need to be
    up-to-date with the available platforms these devices work on, if they want to
    be "part of the game".

- en: iOS, Apple’s operating system for its own portable devices, is undoubtedly one
    of the leading portable platforms today. If it weren’t for MonoTouch, .NET developers
    would have to spend time to learn a new programming language to expand their creativity
    to the iOS ecosystem.

- en: This book, through a series of multiple recipes and with an almost equal number
    of complete projects, will help you become part of this ecosystem, with the help
    of MonoTouch and C#. When you finish reading it, you will be a capable iOS developer,
    ready to unleash your creativity to one of the most popular portable platforms
    today.
