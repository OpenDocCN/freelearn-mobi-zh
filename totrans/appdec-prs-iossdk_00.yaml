- en: The Parse SDK provides you with an independent way to create your application,
    without having any dependency on server-side code, and a huge web-service code.
    Parse emphasizes rapid application development. It significantly accelerates the
    development process. The Parse platform is easy-to-use, scalable, and reliable.

- en: This book will teach you the fundamentals of how to get started with application
    development using the Parse SDK. As this book is meant to quickly get you familiar
    with all the important aspects of the Parse SDK, it will cover lots of subjects
    very quickly. Throughout the book, we will be dealing with the direct implementations
    using effective examples and code. This approach will help you to run the example
    code and integrate the same thing to your project quickly.

    code that requires heavy operations. It's useful for multiplatform app development
    as well, which allows the entire platform to use the same set of code. The Parse
    Cloud also allows you to host your website, and along with that Parse provides
    you with prebuilt e-mail verification and reset password mails. Using these services
    you can send verification mails to a user to verify their e-mail address and reset
    their passwords respectively.
