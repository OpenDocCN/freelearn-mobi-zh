- en: During the WWDC in June 2014, Apple announced a new programming language, called
    Swift. Swift is a very modern and powerful language. In the last year, Swift has
    become a very popular programming language. It has evolved and changed. Since
    Swift is fairly new, there are many questions related to its performance characteristics
    and best practice for achieving high performance in it.
