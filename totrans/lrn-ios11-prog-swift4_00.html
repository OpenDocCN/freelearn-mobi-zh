            <p class="NormalPACKT"><span>In this book, we will build a restaurant reservation app called <em>Let's Eat</em>. We will start the book off by exploring Xcode, our programming environment, which
                  is also known as <span class="KeyWordPACKT">Interface Development Environment</span> (<span class="KeyWordPACKT">IDE</span>). Next, you will start learning the foundations of Swift, the programming language
                  used in iOS apps. Once we are comfortable with the basics of Swift, we will dig deeper
                  to build a more solid foundation.</span></p>
            
            <p class="NormalPACKT"><span>After we have a solid foundation of using Swift, we will start creating the visual
                  aspects of our <em>Let's Eat</em> app. During this process, we will work with storyboards and connect our app's structure
                  together using segues. With our UI complete, we will go over the different ways in
                  which we can display data. To display our data in a grid, we will use Collection Views,
                  and to display our data in a list, we will use Table Views.</span></p>
            
            <p class="NormalPACKT"><span>We will also look at how to add basic and custom annotations on to a map. Finally,
                  it's time to get real data; we will look at what an <span class="KeyWordPACKT">Application Programming Interface</span> (<span class="KeyWordPACKT">API</span>) is and how we can get real restaurant data into our Collection Views, Table Views,
                  and Map.</span></p>
            
            <p class="NormalPACKT"><span>We now have a complete app, but how about adding some bells and whistles? The first
                  place we can add a feature will be on the restaurant detail page where we can add
                  restaurant reviews. Here, users will be able to take or choose a picture and apply
                  a filter on to their picture. They will also be able to give the restaurant a rating
                  as well as a review. When they are done, we will save this data using Core Data.</span></p>
            
            <p class="NormalPACKT"><span>Since we built our app to work on both iPhone and iPad, we should add the ability
                  to make our app support iPad Multitasking. Doing this will allow our app to be open
                  alongside another app at the same time.</span></p>
            
            <p class="NormalPACKT"><span>If we want to be able to send our reservation to a friend, we can create a custom
                  UI for iMessages, which will send them the details for the reservation along with
                  the app it came from. The one thing missing from our app is the ability to notify
                  the user with a custom notification to alert when they have an upcoming reservation.</span></p>
            
            <p class="NormalPACKT" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt"><span>Finally, let's create a quick access for our app using 3D touch where, by tapping
                  our app icon, the user can quickly jump to their reservations. Now that we have added
                  some bells and whistles, let's get this app to our friends using TestFlight,<br/>
                  and finally get it into the App Store.</span></p>

            <p class="NormalPACKT" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt"><span>This book is for beginners who want to be able to create iOS applications. If you
                  have some programming experience, this book is a great way to get a full understanding
                  of how to create an iOS application from scratch and submit it to the App Store. You
                  do not need any knowledge of Swift or any prior programming experience.</span></p>
