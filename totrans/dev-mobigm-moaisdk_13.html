It's recommended that you read and understand the code for the platform's hosts, so you are able to modify them. If you wish to add your own fancy advertising library, or integration with the next generation social network, you'll need to modify the host.</p><p>Let's take a look at the hosts that come in the Moai SDK release.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl1sec68"/>Windows</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to build for <a id="id298" class="indexterm"/>Windows you need to use one of the Visual <a id="id299" class="indexterm"/>Studio projects. You'll find both of them inside <code class="literal">moai-sdk/hosts/folder </code>(<code class="literal">vs2010</code> and <code class="literal">vs2008</code>).</p><p>Open up the correct solution for your Visual Studio version. Inside, you'll find all the code you need for the<a id="id300" class="indexterm"/> <strong>GlutHost</strong>, which should run smoothly on windows. Moai SDK already ships with a compiled version of this host in <code class="literal">moai-sdk/bin/win32/</code>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl1sec69"/>Mac OS X</h1></div></div></div><p>The host for <a id="id301" class="indexterm"/>Mac OS X can be compiled using the Xcode<a id="id302" class="indexterm"/> project from <code class="literal">moai-sdk/hosts/xcode/osx</code>.</p><p>The codebase for this host is basically the same as for the Windows one; it uses the GlutHost program with some considerations to make it work on Mac OS X.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl1sec70"/>Android</h1></div></div></div><p>The Android hosts are<a id="id303" class="indexterm"/> generated using a shell script located in <code class="literal">moai-sdk/hosts/android/run-host.sh</code> (or <code class="literal">.bat</code>). Be sure to have Apache Ant installed and all <a id="id304" class="indexterm"/>the Android stuff as well. Take a look at the wiki page for more information regarding building your game in Android (<a class="ulink" href="http://getmoai.com/wiki/index.php?title=Building_Moai_Games_For_Android_Devices">http://getmoai.com/wiki/index.php?title=Building_Moai_Games_For_Android_Devices</a>).</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note10"/>Note</h3><p>Compiling for Android could be a whole chapter by itself. Besides the mentioned link in Moai SDK wiki, you'll also need some knowledge of Android development, so it's recommended that you head over and read Android's documents before trying to build the host (<a class="ulink" href="http://developer.android.com/develop/index.html">http://developer.android.com/develop/index.html</a>).</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl1sec71"/>Google Chrome (native client)</h1></div></div></div><p>Native client (<a class="ulink" href="https://developers.google.com/native-client/">https://developers.google.com/native-client/</a>) is a new way to introduce <a id="id305" class="indexterm"/>code that runs natively in the computer and that can be <a id="id306" class="indexterm"/>downloaded from your Chrome browser. Moai <a id="id307" class="indexterm"/>SDK comes with a host built for it, which can be found in <code class="literal">moai-sdk/hosts/chrome</code>.</p><p>You'll need to change the <code class="literal">manifest.json</code> file and put all your code in the same folder.</p><p>Detailed instructions on how to do this are located at Moai's wiki link (<a class="ulink" href="http://getmoai.com/wiki/index.php?title=Building_Moai_Games_for_Google_Chrome">http://getmoai.com/wiki/index.php?title=Building_Moai_Games_for_Google_Chrome</a>).</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl1sec72"/>Linux</h1></div></div></div><p>At the time of writing the book, <a id="id308" class="indexterm"/>Linux is not available as a target platform in the<a id="id309" class="indexterm"/> Moai SDK release, but Moai works on it building from the source code.</p><p>There are two main ways to do this right now:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using the Linux branch from the Moai SDK's GitHub repository as explained at <a class="ulink" href="http://franciscotufro.com/2013/01/compiling-moai-on-linux/">http://franciscotufro.com/2013/01/compiling-moai-on-linux/</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using the spacepluk's branch as explained at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/spacepluk/moai-dev">https://github.com/spacepluk/moai-dev</a></li></ul></div><p>The second method is preferred for now since it has Untz support, but official Linux support is on the way, so double check the latest Moai SDK <a id="id310" class="indexterm"/>release <a id="id311" class="indexterm"/>to verify that Linux is not yet officially<a id="id312" class="indexterm"/> supported.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"/>Note</h3><p>
<strong>Insert the next platform here</strong>
</p><p>We mentioned this before, but Moai SDK has been developed in a way that it should be easy to port to whatever platform that supports C++ and OpenGL. If you are able to get it working for a new platform, you can share your experience and send a pull request to <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/moai/moai-dev">https://github.com/moai/moai-dev</a>. We will all be grateful!</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch13lvl1sec73"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter we summarized the different platforms that are currently supported by Moai SDK. We pointed to where to get information about building a host for those platforms.</p><p>What do you say? Are you ready to create the next big game? I bet you are! Go ahead, create the best game ever and don't forget to tell the community about it!</p><p>Join the forums at <a class="ulink" href="http://getmoai.com/forums/">http://getmoai.com/forums/</a> and be a part of this amazing game-development community. We're waiting for you.</p><p>Thanks for reading the book and supporting open source technologies. Hope to see you around soon!</p></div></body></html>
