                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>You have made some awesome moves already! You know what you are passionate about and perhaps you have already created a very first <strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong> (<strong>MVP</strong>). This could be a website, a survey, or maybe even a very simple app. It does not really matter how it manifests itself. The only thing that is important here is that it is something that could prove your hypothesis and it is something that requires only minimal effort. Learn from the feedback that you get, and figure out if your earliest assumptions are correct. If so, it is time for the next step.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will see how to move on and how to deal with one of the biggest challenges of a startup. Time and timing are essential. This is particularly true for a bootstrapped startup. We will look at how to get things done when nothing is there yet and when the most important resources (time and money) are very limited. What you need is the right mindset and a very pragmatic approach.</p>
<p>You do not need a huge office and all kinds of fancy stuff. Also, you do not need many rules, but most of the time things do not happen automatically. Anyhow, we need a few rules, no matter how cool your startup may be. A pragmatic approach is a nice balance between total chaos and bureaucracy. You will keep a clear focus on what you want to accomplish, and developing new features is not going to take you longer than strictly needed. Such an approach will result in developing exactly the required functionality during a particular stage of your app.</p>
<p>There are no shortcuts in startup land when searching for a product-solution or a product-market fit, but as a developer you often do not need to reinvent the wheel. Readymade solutions are widely available for most situations. For example, in <a href="f05cc1f7-9372-486a-b2ea-4fe6f4a5d69f.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 8</span></a>, <em>Cloud Solutions for App Experiments</em>, we will investigate which parties are offering a <strong>Mobile Backend as a Service</strong> (<strong>MBaaS</strong>), and in <a href="b81516a3-47fe-4318-a8e6-2bc8f2f34a04.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 10</span></a>, <em>There Is an API for That!</em>, we will look at various mash-up ideas. Such solutions are real-time savers irrespective of whether you are just using them to build an MVP or using them during the whole lifetime of your app.</p>
<p>Specifically, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn about the benefits of timeboxed programming</li>
<li>See what options are available to get started with nothing</li>
<li>Demonstrate how to keep things well structured</li>
<li>Investigate whether there are any shortcuts</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Timeboxed programming</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>For each iteration, you need to decide how long it will take and what features will come with it. As you have seen in <a href="0455b0c7-1234-4a39-a89c-b35deb8f92ed.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 4</span></a>, <em>An Agile Workflow in a Nutshell</em>, a typical sprint takes 2 to 3 weeks. Although this may be difficult at first, you will learn soon enough what you and your team members can accomplish during such a sprint. Sometimes you will have no clue how long the development of a feature will take. In that case, a timeboxed approach can help you as well. Before you start working on that feature, you allocate a particular amount of time. Afterwards, you can determine what you have accomplished and you can decide whether the feature can be released as it is. Even if it is not completely functional, as long as it contains no (severe) bugs, it can help you to get early feedback.</p>
<p>Keep things simple and develop only the features that you actually need for that particular iteration. You should ask yourself what it is that you want to prove and what feedback you need in order to proceed. Again, it is important to realize how relevant that feedback is when you look at your app's current phase. For example, you should not be focusing too much on the development of In-App Purchase functionality if the base functionality of your app has not been completed yet.</p>
<p>"You Aren't Gonna Need It", also known as the YAGNI acronym, is one of the ideas behind Agile development and extreme programming (XP), but it does apply here as well.</p>
<p>The goal should always be to achieve maximum learning with the least amount of effort. Also, keep it simple and solve one problem at a time for one product and for one type of customer. As a developer, you will often foresee scenarios that need to be supported, the so-called unhappy flows, but who cares about them if the happy flow is not ready yet?</p>
<p>Consider the scenario where the idea of timeboxing involves the focus more on the time spent instead of the tasks done. So, instead of thinking of features that should be done in a particular amount of time, think of a particular amount of time and what features you can implement given that amount of time. To maximize learning, the changes that come with each new release of your app should be as small as possible while still delivering relevant business value. Timeboxed programming is essential to make sure resources are delivered in a particular amount of time. Determine deliverables and a deadline for each timeboxed iteration. Using this methodology, your productivity will be improved and you can keep the promises to your customers.</p>
<p>In general, get to know your (potential) customers. Learn more about their problem. It is the problem your app needs to solve. This may sound like a job for your more business-oriented cofounder, but a better understanding of this also makes you a better developer. Ask questions and find out what the common problems are for all of your customers.</p>

<p>It is important to realize that some parts of the solution you are creating are essential, but may not necessarily be good candidates for automating processes right away. These parts can be offered manually as well. Such a solution is known as a <strong>Concierge Service</strong>, or as the <strong>Concierge Minimum Viable Product</strong> (<strong>CMVP</strong>). At first glance, that does not really seem to make much sense to a developer. You might be thinking that the lean startup methodology is about minimizing waste, and wonder why we should do things manually?</p>
<p>The truth is that doing things manually is indeed not very efficient, but that is fine for now. It is a short-term solution that can help you gain new insights and learn how to solve the user's or customer's problem. Once you fully understand the problem and know what the solution should be, it is time for automation.</p>
<p>What would happen if you worked on an awesome feature for 3 months and afterwards learned that your app does not seem to know your user's problem? It will probably be a huge disappointment for all stakeholders and you will wonder why this happened. You should always ask yourself whether you have all the required information to solve the issue and whether you understand your customer's needs. If that is not the case, your effort may lead to delivering a product that nobody wants. You might need to refactor a lot, or start all over again. Such activity would be a waste of your time (and if you are having bad luck, your credibility).</p>

<p>The fact that you focus on the features that are most important is because they contribute to the hypotheses that you want to prove. However, this does not mean that your product has to be crappy. Using a timeboxed approach will help you deliver often (daily or weekly) and on time.</p>
<p>The features that you will make available are unlikely to be perfect, but with each new iteration you can improve them. Of course, you will never have a second chance for a first impression, but aiming for perfection is not going to help you prove your hypotheses. Instead, it will prevent you from getting feedback early. Still, it is important that you choose your first users carefully. Early adopters are very different from mainstream users, having different expectations. Managing expectations is therefore very important when asking early adopters to test your solution. Be honest about the phase your startup is in and tell them that the solution has been built to maximize learning and that you would love to get their feedback. It may sound a bit harsh, but ultimate perfection does not exist anyway. The opinion of your early adopters is important and your opinion does not really matter.</p>

<p>Releasing early and often—for example, once a week or every 2 weeks—will maximize your learning. Timeboxed programming could help you deliver the features that matter.</p>
<p>The loop shown in the following figure is known as the <strong>Build-Measure-Learn Feedback</strong> cycle. It is easy to get feedback if you know your early adopters. That is not always possible if you are developing an app. There are great tools available to obtain analytical data.

<p>A blank page, a basic idea, and an early MVP. That is how it starts, and it is not exactly nothing. But that does not make it a company, or an app, and it certainly does not come with customers, unless you have a really convincing MVP or a great production-solution fit.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of app you are developing, sooner or later you will face the famous chicken and egg problem. Simply put, an app that depends on user-generated content will have no content without users, but also no users without content. So, where do you start?</p>
<p>Any marketplace-based app has to deal with this challenge, whether it is an app for dating, job finding, or bringing companies together. But it does apply to other types of apps as well. There are many apps available in the App Store. They all are doing more or less the same thing, so why should your users (and later, your customers) use your app and not any of the other apps? Sooner or later you need to find an answer to the question, "What makes your app better?" Is your app better because it is cheaper, does it provide better services, or does your app appear to be more convincing simply because your app has a large user base? In short, you do not yet have a platform with many users or testimonials because you just got started. Oh, yes, you do have a chicken and egg challenge!</p>

<p>To solve the chicken and egg challenge and to get your app started, there are some simple solutions. One of them is: Fake it until you make it. It sounds like cheating, or at least it sounds like something that is bad, while in fact it is not. It's a workaround for the chicken and egg problem. No, we are not going to lie, at most we will just pretend. If you are developing a dating app, ask all your relatives and friends to sign up with a nice profile photo. You can use this approach not only for user data, but for all types of content. If you are working on a B2B app, you could purchase some company data, enrich it, and present as if it is your own. Refer to <a href="b81516a3-47fe-4318-a8e6-2bc8f2f34a04.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 10</span></a>, <em>There is an API For That!</em>, about mash-ups to read more information about that topic. Another option that would work well (for example, think of an app displaying job information) is to get data from various other sources and start as an app offering aggregated data. There are many ways to get started and they all are aimed at growing your app by developing content and your user base.</p>

<p>You too can become an expert, just by doing it. You can start to become a more significant player for some niche. Just be that expert while learning on the go. For example, when we began with our new startup built around a concept of narrow casting combined with social media, we really had no clue about what narrow casting was other than the television screens that you often see in stores or at train stations. By writing a blog about the topic of narrow casting, we have learned a lot and gradually we have become experts. And, even more important, it has helped us to shape our vision on the problem that we were trying to solve. In our case, this was about finding an answer to the question, how we could make narrow casting a more interactive process? Pretending will help you to set your targets, and once you have reached them, it is no longer fake, but real. You can build your reputation this way. How cool is that? Obviously, you have to keep things real. Do not fake things if you never can fulfil the expectations that come with them, but do it to buy more time, to get the job done, or to become an expert along the way. If you keep it real, your startup will become what you envision.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Grab and adapt</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Almost all startup ideas derive from existing concepts. A little enhancement, different pricing, service, UX, or particular approach can be the <strong>Unique Selling Points</strong> (<strong>USP</strong>) that will lead to a unique product. The same service, but promoted with a different marketing approach, can result in a totally different product. It is a trend that you often see. For example, I have been working on a project for an enabler of <strong>Mobile Virtual Network Operators</strong> (<strong>MVNO</strong>). Their customers were all mobile service providers who did not own the infrastructure themselves. The biggest difference between all the virtual providers was just marketing strategy. Anyone can start their own network from scratch with little investment. All you need to do is grab and adapt. You have to be careful, though. You need to be aware of patents and copyright issues, but there are many (open source) projects that you can use as the foundation for your app, or just for a first MVP.</p>
<p>For very little money, you can also buy a concept, or even a complete app, that comes close to your startup idea. In that case, all you need to do is to enhance it and see if you can make a difference. To start something new, most apps just need a little twist. For example, have a look at <a href="http://codecanyon.net">http://codecanyon.net</a>. You will find some great starting points here. There are apps for Android, iOS, web-based apps, and many more. You can find Flappy Bird clone apps, restaurant apps, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Let's say your startup is developing a travel app. You can search for these kinds of apps and buy one of them. You can quickly prove your hypothesis just by making some modifications to the app:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="366" src="assets/768a176f-52a9-4fa3-a620-669cbf91d3c6.png" width="563"/></div>
<p>That is a real time-saver and it is worth the little investment. What you learn will help you define what the app should do and what it should look like at the early stage. Perhaps later you still want to develop your app more or less from scratch. However, if you think that a readymade base app will help you collect useful insights quickly, then it will not be a hard decision to follow this approach.</p>

<p>How can you offer or describe your app when it does not yet exist? A nonexisting app is pretty hard to demonstrate, so how will customers be made aware of it, and how will they know why they should get the app? They somehow have to find out that there is an (concept) app that solves the problems they are experiencing. Here, the funny thing is that your app itself is not really that important. Sorry, your app alone is not the product. It is just a vehicle for your users to get something done. Show a slideshow or a video that explains what your app does and why it can help solve their problem. This can be just as convincing. You will get their attention and if you are doing really well, you will get their pre-orders right away.</p>
<p>If you do not have the skills to create a great video, or if you are in need of a logo or any other design, then have a look at <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.fiverr.com/</a>. They have many freelance designers who can help you. Another website that you can look at is <a href="https://99designs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://99designs.com/</a>.</p>
<p>A video or presentation is not really that different from an MVP, right? Well, it is one, although in this example we are testing the product-market fit-related hypotheses, instead of the product-solution fit-related hypotheses. Every startup owner, regardless of his or her role, has to do sales and be able to sell stuff before it even exists. That is not lying and it is not even faking. It is a creative way of promising a solution for known problems.</p>
<p>However, don't ever fake testimonials or lie about the number of customers or make things ten times bigger than they are. Keep things real. Instead, work on a great reputation, become an expert, create a very convincing website and include a feature list, even when it has not been completed yet. To show that people can trust your company, also add a company policy link with terms and conditions. Add pricing tables to your website, even when you are not yet ready to sell. It is never too early to measure (revenue) traction.

<p>If you start learning from the feedback you obtain through interviews or metrics, it is very likely that the flow or structure of your app will change. As business requirements change often, ad hoc changes need to be made. This requires you to refactor the code of your app. That is something that most developers consider to be important, but in reality it can be easily forgotten or it is never done, simply because there is not enough time for it. Sometimes, refactoring is considered to make the app unstable. However, do not let your technical debt become too large.</p>
<p>Technical debt or even spaghetti code can be the result if you understand underlying process insufficiently, or when you do not allocate enough time for development. In case a startup company has only business-oriented skills, it may have outsourced the development or it may have hired some third party to do the job. If that is the case, there is little to no insight into the technical structure of an app. I strongly recommend you to do most of the development yourself. If you do own a startup with no technical cofounder on-board, then stop reading and find one first! There are many meetups and websites where you can meet somebody (for a cofounder or another role) with the skills that you are looking for. Take a look at these websites: <a href="https://angel.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://angel.co/</a> and <a href="https://cofounderslab.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://cofounderslab.com/</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to keep things, and your code in particular, well structured. Design patterns and a number of disciplines could help you to achieve building apps for Android and for iOS. It is true that Android Studio is offering much more functionality for refactoring purposes, and that using Xcode refactoring requires some extra effort. Nevertheless, refactoring is equally important for both platforms.</p>

<p>There is no need to reinvent the wheel and there is no need for us to repeat ourselves. This is exactly what the <strong>Don't Repeat Yourself</strong> (<strong>DRY</strong>) software development principle dictates. A design pattern is a solution for a common problem, and such a pattern can be used in many places across your app. It is the methodology that we can trust, which will help us to speed up the development process. Patterns could help us develop high-quality software with minimal effort. They also can help us deal with the separation of concerns. Some well-known patterns are the <strong>Model View Controller</strong> (<strong>MVC</strong>) pattern, the somewhat similar <strong>Model View Presenter</strong> (<strong>MVP</strong>), and the <strong>Model-View-ViewModel</strong> (<strong>MVVM</strong>) approach.</p>
<p>There are some great books about design patterns and it is beyond the scope of this book to have a detailed look at all of them, but the MVC/MVP is of particular interest because it is used the most for mobile development. The idea behind the pattern is to separate the UI from the business logic and data from the logic. When you have a closer look on the structure of most Android or iOS apps in Android Studio or in Xcode, you will notice some parts of this pattern already. A controller gets data from another layer. This layer can be a client or a repository class. For example, it will get its data from an API or from a local source. The controller communicates the obtained data through a model (or view model) to the user interface:</p>

<p>Ideally, it should not matter whether your app is getting its data from a local stub, a <strong>Mobile Backend as a Service</strong> (<strong>MBaaS</strong>), a third party API, or your own API. This is very easy to accomplish. You just need to realize that it is important to separate the different concerns and that implementing contracts matter.</p>
<p>Another lesson learned is that you cannot always trust third party services. You must have heard about Parse. It used to be of the most promising MBaaS and a lot of app developers were depending on it to store their app data in the cloud. Recently, they announced that they will shut down their business, which frustrated a lot of developers. Fortunately, Parse has created an open source version of Parse Server. Anyhow, it nicely illustrates what I am trying to say here. Make sure you do not go out of business even if one of your key partners does.</p>

<p>Switching from one service provider to another (key partner) is easy if your app is well structured. Use a separate layer for accessing data and define contracts for the communication between your data layers and your controllers. Contracts are known as an <strong>interface</strong> (for Android) or as a <strong>protocol</strong> (for iOS). They contain no implementation and are nothing but appointments between one class and another. They define what methods are available, what parameters are required, and what the result type will be.</p>
<p>For example, let's say we are getting data from some kind of source. In the interface <kbd>IRepository</kbd>, we will define the names, results, and parameters for all methods that represent some operation. To be more precise, let's say we want to retrieve company news that we have stored somewhere in the cloud. It could be at Parse server (at Back4App or elsewhere), Amazon, Azure, or Firebase, it does not really matter where and how exactly we will get this data. Since it is an interface, we do not have to care about the actual implementation yet.</p>
<p>For Android, it could look like this:</p>
<pre>public interface IRepository{ 
 
    public void getNews(OnRepositoryResult handler, GetNewsRequest request); </pre>
<p>For IOS, it looks like this (in Swift 2.x):</p>
<pre>protocol RepositoryProtocol { 
     
func getNews(handler: RepositoryResultDelegate, request: GetNewsRequest) </pre>
<p>The data layer classes that implement this interface or protocol will perform the actual job. They will retrieve the data from a remote data source.</p>
<p>For example, the Android implementation begins like this:</p>
<pre>public class RemoteRepository implements IRepository { 
 
... 
    @Override 
    public void getNews(OnRepositoryResult handler, GetNewsRequest request) { 
        // Get data asynchronously  and return the result 
    } </pre>
<p>While the IOS implementation begins like this:</p>
<pre>public class RemoteRepository: RepositoryProtocol  { 
     
    ... 
    func getNews(handler: RepositoryResultDelegate, request: GetNewsRequest){ </pre>

<div class="packt_infobox">The data layer could also obtain the data from locally mocked or stubbed data. You can easily switch between the different sources. This makes it a great solution for testing purposes too.</div>

<p>No there are not! Just kidding. There are some services and methodologies that are worthwhile to investigate. They could save you a lot of time and money. Think of an app that needs to communicate with a backend because it needs to support chat functionality, or to support the sharing of texts, pictures, audio, or video with other users. Such an app will have a lot of requirements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synchronizing data from the app to the backend</li>
<li>Getting data from the backend to the app</li>
<li>Data storage</li>
<li>Data streaming</li>
<li>Offline support</li>
<li>Registration and login through email</li>
<li>Registration and login with Facebook or Twitter</li>
</ul>
<p>You probably can build the backend that supports all this yourself, but that is a lot of work and there is no need for that. There are many services available that will take care of all (or some) of the earlier mentioned requirements:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Mash-up</h1>
                </header>

<p>A mash-up can be seen as a composite app that is combining reusable data, presentation, and new logic. It is often seen as web solution, but this approach can be used for native app development as well. Data is everywhere. The government and various organizations have made their data publicly available through APIs. Mash-up solutions do not need to worry about the content in particular, but more about the presentation. They may occur as enterprise, data-oriented, or consumer mash-ups.</p>
<p>The app may gather data from multiple sources, combine and enrich them, and then present them in an app. An example of that could be as simple as producing infographics from the provided data. Another example is getting photos from Flickr and presenting them on a Google map. There are plenty of other and more sophisticated solutions that you can think of. A mash-up can be a great contribution to the development of an MVP or a <strong>Proof of Concept</strong> (<strong>PoC</strong>). Often, when it turns out that a mash-up is a profitable solution, it mostly has the function of aggregator. An example is a website comparing insurance companies.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can develop a mash-up solution relatively fast, but the monetization of it could be more difficult. Again, the biggest downside of a mash-up is the dependency on third parties. If things start to become more serious, then do not just consume their data. You need to do more than that. Avoid a potential shutdown of your business in case the company, that is delivering the data, decides to discontinue its services. You can reduce that risk if you make that company a real key partner. Although there still is a dependency, it is no longer a problem because it has become a manageable one.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we have seen a few things that you could do to get started and keep going. We had a look at the chicken and egg problem and how to deal with it. We also had a look at patterns, and how they could help us to keep things well structured.</p>
<p>Finally, we had a short introduction to <strong>Mobile Backend as a Service</strong> (<strong>MBaaS</strong>) solutions and mash-ups.

But first, we will figure out how minimal an MVP actually should be.</p>
