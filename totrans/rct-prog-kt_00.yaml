- en: Is our world just a collection of states? No. Then why do all the programming
    paradigms represent our world as a series of states? Can't we reflect objects
    that are real, moving, and continuously changing state in programming? These are
    the questions that have interested me ever since I first learned programming.

- en: When I started working as an Android developer, these questions continued to
    plague me, but got some friends as well. Why do we need so many loops in an application?
    Isn't there anything to replace the iterators? Also, for Android applications,
    we must keep a lot of things in mind, as the processors and RAM in a mobile device
    are not as powerful as those in your PC. There is often an Out of Memory Exception
    if you do not structure your projects well. So, if we could have less iterators
    in our program, the UX will significantly improve, but, how do we do it? How do
    we replace iterators, and with what?

- en: One fine day, I read a blog post about reactive programming and the ReactiveX
    Framework, (most probably by Thomas Nield, thanks to him), and it gave me a glimpse
    of the answers to all my questions. So, I started learning reactive programming.

- en: I found out that the learning curve of reactive programming is very much complex,
    and many developers out there leave it part way through. Reactive programming
    is considered an advanced topic in most places. However, I continued my journey
    toward learning reactive programming, and as a reward for my patience and consistency,
    I got answers to my questions. RxJava (and all other ReactiveX libraries) represents
    models just like our real-time world, and, unlike states, they model behavior
    with moving and continuously changing states. Unlike an iterator pattern, it believes
    on push mechanism, which will push data/event to the subscriber/observer as it
    comes, making the programming a lot more easier and a lot more like the human
    world.

- en: On the other hand, around 2 years ago (in December 2015), when I read a Jetbrains
    blog (yes, I do read a lot, and write as well) about a new language that will
    work in JVM, my first thought was, why a new language? So, I started exploring
    Kotlin, and I fell in love with it. The sole purpose of the language is making
    programming a lot easier. Whenever someone speaks about the benefits of Kotlin,
    they talk about handling null pointer exceptions so easily, but there are a lot
    more advantages; the list is never-ending and continues to grow.

- en: The best thing that can happen to a programmer is combining the Kotlin and ReactiveX
    Frameworks; Mario Arias did this awesome job for the sake of the Developers Community
    and started RxKotlin on October 2013.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only thing that RxKotlin lacks is documentation; I personally believe that
    the main reason behind the complex learning curve of ReactiveX libraries is a
    lack of documentation and, mostly, a lack of awareness. I've seen a lot of developers,
    even with more than 6-8 years of experience who have not heard of reactive programming;
    I believe this book will have a bigger role in changing this scenario. This book
    is also a part of my mission (also the mission of Kotlin Kolkata User Group) to
    spread the use and knowledge of Kotlin as much as possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As per as my knowledge, this is the first book that helps you learn reactive
    programming in Kotlin, covering RxKotlin (precisely RxKotlin 2.0) and the Reactor-Kotlin
    Framework. It is a step-by-step guide to learn RxKotlin and Reactor-Kotlin with
    added coverage on Spring and Android. I hope this book will help you find the
    benefits of Kotlin and reactive programming altogether, and, with the help of
    this book, you will be able to successfully apply reactive programming to all
    your Kotlin projects.

- en: We will be using Java 8 and Kotlin 1.1.50 for the programs in this book, so
    Oracle's JDK 1.8 along with Kotlin 1.1.50 (this can be skipped downloading if
    you're using IntelliJ IDEA) will be required. You will need an environment to
    write and compile your Kotlin code (I strongly recommend Intellij IDEA, but you
    can use anything of your choice), and preferably a build automation system such
    as Gradle or Maven. Later in this book, we will use Android Studio (2.3.3 or 3.0).
    Everything you need in this book should be free to use and not require commercial
    or personal licensing (we are using the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition).
