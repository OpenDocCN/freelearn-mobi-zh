			<p>The three most popular ways to communicate through an iPhone is by phone calls, text messaging, and email. Since people cannot always take a phone call and text messages are often brief, email can be a great way to communicate large amounts of information that others can review at their leisure. </p>
			<p>With email, you can send text and file attachments such as pictures or video. By sending and receiving email on your iPhone, you can choose which method of communicating is best for your needs.</p>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor416"/>The topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting up an email account</li>
				<li>Sending email</li>
				<li>Reading messages</li>
				<li>Creating a VIP list</li>
				<li>Filtering email</li>
				<li>Flagging messages</li>
				<li>Dealing with junk email</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor417"/><a id="_idTextAnchor418"/><a id="_idTextAnchor419"/><a id="_idTextAnchor420"/>Setting up an email account</h1>
			<p>Before you can send <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>and receive email messages, you need an email account such as a free one through Gmail or Yahoo, or one provided through your work. When adding a popular and common email account, such as Gmail, your iPhone can set up the email account with little more than your email address and password. When adding a work or unusual email account, you may need to manually enter technical details, such as POP or IMAP server names. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-178">Setting up a common email account<a id="_idTextAnchor421"/><a id="_idTextAnchor422"/></h2>
			<p>Your iPhone <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>can automatically recognize and set up the following types of email accounts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>iCloud</li>
				<li>Microsoft Exchange</li>
				<li>Google (Gmail)</li>
				<li>Yahoo</li>
				<li>AOL</li>
				<li>Outlook</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To set up an email account through one of these email providers, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Mail</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Accounts</strong>. An <strong class="bold">Account</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Add Account</strong>. An <strong class="bold">Add Account</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.1</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer277"><img alt="Figure 10.1 – Selecting a popular email provider&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.01_B14100.jpg"/></div></li>
				<li>cTap the name of your email provider (such as <strong class="bold">AOL</strong> or <strong class="bold">Yahoo</strong>) and follow the instructions to type in your email address and password.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Most people <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>use one of the previously mentioned popular email providers, such as iCloud or Yahoo. However, in some cases, you may need to enter email account information manually.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor423"/>Manually setting up an email account</h2>
			<p>If your email account is not <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>one of the more popular ones, such as a work or school email account, you may need to manually enter your email account information. That means you'll need to get information beforehand, such as host names and other technical information that you may need to obtain from an IT administrator.</p>
			<p>To manually set up an email account, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Mail</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Accounts</strong>. An <strong class="bold">Account</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Add Account</strong>. An <strong class="bold">Add Account</strong> screen appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 10.1</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Other</strong>. An <strong class="bold">Add Account</strong> screen<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.2</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer278"><img alt="Figure 10.2 – The Add Account screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.2 – The Add Account screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Add Mail Account</strong>. A <strong class="bold">New Account</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.3</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer279"><img alt="Figure 10.3 – The New Account screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.03_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.3 – The New Account screen</p></li>
				<li>Type in your name, email address, password, and a description of your email account, and then tap <strong class="bold">Next</strong>. </li>
				<li>If your iPhone can<a id="_idIndexMarker631"/> successfully connect to your email account, you can tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. Otherwise, you will need to tap <strong class="bold">Next</strong> and enter additional information, such as mail server names and whether your email account is IMAP or POP.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To make sure you successfully connected to your email account, you may want to get a friend to send an email message to make sure you can receive it. Once you know you've successfully connected an email account, you can start sending and receiving email.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor424"/>Sending email</h1>
			<p>Sending email involves<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> defining an email address, subject line, and text that makes up the bulk of your message. You can type an email address, but it's far easier to select an email address that you previously stored in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. </p>
			<p>When you send email, you need to specify at least one email address. You can also specify additional email addresses in the <strong class="bold">Cc:</strong> (carbon copy) or <strong class="bold">Bcc:</strong> (blind copy) text fields. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Carbon copy</em> means everyone who receives the message can also see all the additional email addresses that received the same message.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Blind copy</em> means no one can see any of the additional email addresses who may have received the same message. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor425"/>Writing and sending email</h2>
			<p>To create an email to send, you need to<a id="_idIndexMarker633"/> specify a recipient's email address, a subject line, and the<a id="_idIndexMarker634"/> actual message itself. </p>
			<p>To send email, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app screen appears and displays the New Message icon at the bottom-right corner of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.4</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer280"><img alt="Figure 10.4 – The New Message icon&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.4 – The New Message <a id="_idTextAnchor426"/><a id="_idTextAnchor427"/>icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the New Message icon. A <strong class="bold">New Message</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.5</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer281"><img alt="Figure 10.5 – The New Message screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.5 – The New Message screen</p></li>
				<li>Type an email address in the <strong class="bold">To:</strong> text field, or tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon on the far right to open the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app and then tap a name.</li>
				<li>(Optional) Tap in the <strong class="bold">Cc</strong>/<strong class="bold">Bcc, From:</strong> text field and type any additional email addresses that you want to receive your message as well.</li>
				<li>Type a description of your message in the <strong class="bold">Subject:</strong> text field.</li>
				<li>Type your message in the message text field that appears above the <strong class="bold">Sent from my iPhone</strong> text.</li>
				<li>Tap the Send icon (it looks like an up arrow inside a circle) in the upper-right corner of the screen. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The preceding steps assume you want to write and send an email message right away. However, sometimes you may want to <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/>start writing a message and save it as a draft so that you <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>can go back to it later.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor428"/>Saving email as a draft</h2>
			<p>Sometimes you may want to write <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>part of a message and then come back later to edit the text before sending it out. So, instead of writing and sending a message, you write a message and then save it in a special Drafts folder. Then you can go back and edit that message when you're ready to send it.</p>
			<p>To save a message as a draft, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen and then tap the New Message icon at the bottom-right corner of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 10.4</em>).</li>
				<li>Type text in the blank email message.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> in the upper-left corner of the screen. A list of options appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.6</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer282"><img alt="Figure 10.6 – Choosing to save a message as a draft&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.6 – Choosing to save a message as a draft</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Save Draft</strong>. (<strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> lets you go back to editing your message, while <strong class="bold">Delete Draft</strong> deletes your entire message without sending it.)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've saved a message as a draft, you can return to that message at any time to edit it and eventually send it off. To edit a message stored in the <strong class="bold">Drafts</strong> folder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home<a id="_idIndexMarker638"/> Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears, which displays a number showing how many messages are stored in the <strong class="bold">Drafts</strong> folder, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.7</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer283"><img alt="Figure 10.7 – The Mailboxes screen showing the Drafts folder&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.07_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.7 – The Mailboxes screen showing the Drafts folder</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Drafts</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Drafts</strong> screen appears, listing all the messages that you haven't sent out yet.</li>
				<li>Tap on the message you want to edit. Your chosen message appears, letting you type or edit the email address, subject line, and text.</li>
				<li>Edit your message.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Send</strong> icon to send your <a id="_idIndexMarker639"/>message or tap <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> and then tap <strong class="bold">Save Draft </strong>to save the message back in the <strong class="bold">Drafts</strong> folder. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Eventually you'll either want to send a message or delete it. To delete a message from the <strong class="bold">Drafts</strong> folder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears, which displays a number showing how many messages are stored in the <strong class="bold">Drafts</strong> folder (see <em class="italic">Figure 10.7</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Drafts</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Drafts</strong> screen appears, listing all the messages that you haven't sent out yet.</li>
				<li>Swipe left on the message you want to delete. A red <strong class="bold">Trash</strong> icon appears on the far right, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.8</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer284"><img alt="Figure 10.8 – The Trash icon lets you delete a message&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.08_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.8 – The Trash icon lets you delete a message</p></li>
				<li>Tap the Trash icon to delete the message from the <strong class="bold">Drafts</strong> folder.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Email can be handy for <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>sending text, but occasionally you may want to send a file such as a word processor document or a video. To do this, you need to attach a file to a message.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-183">Attaching files to an email m<a id="_idTextAnchor429"/><a id="_idTextAnchor430"/>essage</h2>
			<p>Oftentimes, you need to share a<a id="_idIndexMarker641"/> word processor, spreadsheet, or presentation file, or a video file. To share any type of file, you need to attach that file to your email. Then you can send text along with the file or just the file itself.</p>
			<p>To attach a file to an email message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the New Message icon. A <strong class="bold">New Message</strong> screen appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 10.5</em>).</li>
				<li>Press and hold a fingertip in the message text field (above the <strong class="bold">Sent from my iPhone</strong> text) until a menu appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.9</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer285"><img alt="Figure 10.9 – A pop-up menu appears when you press and hold in a message text field&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.9 – A pop-up menu appears when you press and hold in a message text field</p></li>
				<li>Tap the right arrow on the far right of the pop-up menu to see more options, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.10</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer286"><img alt="Figure 10.10 – Adding a picture or document to an email message&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.10_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.10 – Adding a picture or document to an email message</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the type of file you want to attach, such as <strong class="bold">Insert Photo or Video</strong> or <strong class="bold">Add Document</strong>. Your chosen types of files appear, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.11</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer287"><img alt="Figure 10.11 – Choosing a file to attach to an email message&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.11_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.11 – Choosing a file to attach to an email message</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the file you want to attach to an email message. If you want to add a picture or video, you can tap on<a id="_idIndexMarker642"/> multiple files and then tap the close icon (<strong class="bold">X</strong>) when you're done. You can repeat the preceding steps to add multiple files to a single email message. Just make sure your email account will allow you to send large amounts of data.<p class="callout-heading">Note </p><p class="callout">Most email providers set a maximum file size limit that you can send in a single email message, such as 10 MB or 25 MB. Check with your email provider so you'll know the largest file you can send.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sending messages is only half the use of email. The other half involves receiving and reading messages that other people send to you.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor431"/>Reading messages</h1>
			<p>Once you give out your email<a id="_idIndexMarker643"/> address to others, they'll likely send you messages. When you receive a message, you'll have the option of reading it, replying to it, forwarding it to others, storing it in a folder for future reference, or deleting it altogether. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor432"/>Choosing a message to read</h2>
			<p>Before you can read a message, you need to <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>select the message you want to read. To read a message, follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong>. A list of messages appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on a message you want to read. Your chosen message appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Previous or Next icons in the upper-right corner of the screen to read the previous or next message, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.12</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer288"><img alt="Figure 10.12 – The Inbox, Previous, and Next icons&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.12 – The Inbox, Previous, and Next icons</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> button in the upper-left corner of the screen to go back to seeing a list of messages in the <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You may just want to read <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>a message and keep it, but it's likely you'll want to reply to that message. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor433"/>Responding to a message</h2>
			<p>When you reply to an existing message, your<a id="_idIndexMarker646"/> reply contains any new text you type, along with the entire contents of the previous message. This lets the recipient understand the context of your new message based on the text that you're responding to. </p>
			<p>There are three options for responding to a message:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reply</strong>: Sends a message only to the person who sent you the message</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reply All</strong>: Sends a message to everyone who received the same message through <strong class="bold">Cc:</strong> (carbon copy) or <strong class="bold">Bcc:</strong> (blind copy)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Forward</strong>: Sends a message to someone whose email address wasn't originally on the message</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To reply to a message, follow <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong>. A list of messages appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on a message you want to read. Your chosen message appears and displays a Reply icon at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.13</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer289"><img alt="Figure 10.13 – The Reply icon&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.13_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.13 – The Reply icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the Reply icon. A sheet of options <a id="_idIndexMarker648"/>appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.14</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer290"><img alt="Figure 10.14 – Options appear at the bottom of the screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.14 – Options appear at the bottom of the screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Reply</strong> (to send a message to the person who sent you the message), <strong class="bold">Reply All</strong> (to send a message to everyone who received the message), or <strong class="bold">Forward</strong> (to send a message to a completely new email address). A new message screen appears that contains all the text of the previously viewed message.</li>
				<li>(Optional) If you chose <strong class="bold">Forward</strong> in <em class="italic">Step 6</em>, type an email address that you want to receive your forwarded message.</li>
				<li>Type any additional text you wish above the <strong class="bold">Sent from my iPhone</strong> text. </li>
				<li>Tap the Send icon in the upper-right corner of the screen to send your message.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Replying to a message can be a fast way to send a message to the person who sent a message to you. Once you<a id="_idIndexMarker649"/> read or reply to a message, you might want to move a message to another folder to keep your <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder uncluttered.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor434"/>Moving a message to the Archive folder</h2>
			<p>Every time you<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> receive a message, it automatically goes to your <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder. Since this can clutter up your <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder, you may want to move messages to the <strong class="bold">Archive</strong> folder. That way, you can keep a message and keep the <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder uncluttered.</p>
			<p>To move a message to the <strong class="bold">Archive</strong> folder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong>. A list of messages appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on a message you want to move to the <strong class="bold">Archive</strong> folder. The Folder icon appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.15</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer291"><img alt="Figure 10.15 – The Folder icon&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.15 – The Folder icon</p></li>

				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Archive</strong> folder. Your selected<a id="_idIndexMarker651"/> message moves to the <strong class="bold">Archive</strong> folder.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've moved a message to the <strong class="bold">Archive</strong> folder, you'll probably want to view it later. To view any messages in the <strong class="bold">Archive</strong> folder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Archive</strong>. A list of messages in the <strong class="bold">Archive</strong> folder appears.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whether you move a message to the <strong class="bold">Archive</strong> folder or keep it in the <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder, you may eventually want to delete a message when you no longer need it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor435"/>Deleting a message</h2>
			<p>Every time you receive a message, it<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> automatically goes to your <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder. Since this can clutter up your <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder, you may want to move messages to the <strong class="bold">Archive</strong> folder. That way, you can keep a message and keep the <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder uncluttered.</p>
			<p>To delete a single message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the folder that contains the message you want to delete, such as <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> or<strong class="bold"> Archive</strong>. A list of messages appears.</li>
				<li>Swipe left on the message you want to delete. A <strong class="bold">Trash</strong> icon appears on the right, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.17</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer293"><img alt="Figure 10.17 – The Trash icon appears when you swipe left&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.17 – The Trash icon appears when you swipe left</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Trash</strong> icon.</li>

			<p>Before deleting a message, you might want to review it first. To delete a message after reading it, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.18 – The trash icon appears in the bottom-left corner</p>
			<p>If you want to delete multiple messages, you could swipe left on each message or open them up individually and tap the trash icon, but that would be tedious, and there is a faster way.</p>
			<p>To delete multiple messages, follow these steps:</p>

				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the folder that contains the messages you want to delete, such as <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> or <strong class="bold">Archive</strong>. A list of messages appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen. Radio buttons (empty circles) appear to the left of each message.</li>
				<li>Tap in the radio button of each message you want to delete, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.19</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer295"><img alt="Figure 10.19 – Selecting multiple messages to delete&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.19_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.19 – Selecting multiple messages to delete</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> in the <a id="_idIndexMarker655"/>bottom-right corner of the screen.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you delete a message by mistake and later want to retrieve it, you can find it in the <strong class="bold">Trash</strong> folder. To retrieve messages from the <strong class="bold">Trash</strong> folder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Trash</strong> folder. A list of messages appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the message you want to retrieve.</li>
				<li>Tap the Folder icon at the bottom of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 10.15</em>). A list of folders appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Getting email can be fun, but over time you <a id="_idIndexMarker656"/>may wind up with a flood of email from important people to useless messages. How can you sort through the clutter? By creating a special VIP list.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor436"/>Creating a VIP list</h1>
			<p>The main idea behind a VIP list is to <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>automatically route email from certain people into a special VIP folder. Now you can first check your VIP folder for important messages and then later check your regular <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder for messages from everyone else.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">To create a VIP list, you must first store a name and email address in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</p>
			<p>To create a VIP list, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">VIP</strong> folder. The <strong class="bold">VIP List</strong> screen appears and displays an <strong class="bold">Add VIP</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Add VIP</strong> button. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> screen appears, listing all the names stored in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. If a name appears dimmed, it's because you have not stored an email address for that name. </li>
				<li>Tap a name to store in your VIP list.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you store a name in your VIP list, you'll receive a<a id="_idIndexMarker658"/> notification any time you receive an email in your VIP folder. <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> from a VIP appear in both your <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> and <strong class="bold">VIP</strong> folders.</p>
			<p>A gold star to the left of a message identifies messages from people on your VIP list, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.20</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer296">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.20 – Identifying messages also stored in the VIP list</p>
			<p>Eventually, you may want to remove people from your VIP list. To remove someone from your VIP list, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears. An Info icon appears to the right of the VIP folder, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.21</em>. This Info icon appears as long as you have identified at least one person from your <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app as a VIP:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer297"><img alt="Figure 10.21 – The Info icon near the VIP folder&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.21_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.21 – The Info icon near the VIP folder</p></li>
				<li>Tap the Info icon that appears to the right of the VIP folder. The <strong class="bold">VIP List</strong> screen appears, listing all the names currently stored in your VIP List.</li>
				<li>Swipe left on the name you<a id="_idIndexMarker659"/> want to remove from your VIP list. A <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> icon appear to the right of that name, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.22</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer298"><img alt="Figure 10.22 – Removing a name from the VIP list&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.22_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.22 – Removing a name from the VIP list</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The VIP list can be one way to make it easier to<a id="_idIndexMarker660"/> find important messages. Another way is to toggle between displaying all messages and displaying only new messages.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor437"/>Filtering email</h1>
			<p>Normally, the <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder lists all <a id="_idIndexMarker661"/>messages, both those you have read and those you have not read. To make it easier to find and read all unread messages, you can filter your folder to show only unread messages. Then you can turn off the filter to display all messages (read and unread) again.</p>
			<p>To filter a folder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the folder you want to filter, such as the <strong class="bold">Inbox</strong> folder. The list of messages in that folder appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Filter icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.23</em>. When the Filter icon is highlighted, the screen only shows unread messages:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer299"><img alt="Figure 10.23 – The Filter icon&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.23_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.23 – The Filter icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the Filter icon again. When the Filter icon is no longer highlighted, the screen will show both read and unread messages.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When you first receive <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>a message, it's marked as unread with a blue dot to the left of that message. As soon as you read it, that message will then be considered read. However, you can mark a message as unread to make it easy to find it again when you use the Filter icon. </p>
			<p>To mark a message as unread (even if you have already read it), follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap a folder that contains the message you want to mark as unread. </li>
				<li>Swipe left on the message you want to mark as unread. <strong class="bold">More</strong>, <strong class="bold">Flag</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Trash</strong> icons appear on the right.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">More</strong>. A list of options appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.24</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer300"><img alt="Figure 10.24 – Options for marking a message&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.24_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.24 – Options for marking a message</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Mark as Unread</strong>. A blue dot now appears to the left of that message until you open and read that message again.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When you mark a message <a id="_idIndexMarker663"/>unread, you can easily find it using the Filter icon. However, each time you open that message again, that message is no longer considered unread. For another way to identify certain messages, consider flagging them instead.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor438"/>Flagging messages</h1>
			<p>Not all messages you receive may be <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>equally important. To make it easy to find the important messages, you can flag them. That way, you can visually spot all the important messages and skip over the less important ones.</p>
			<p>To flag a message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap a folder that contains the message you want to flag. </li>
				<li>Swipe left on the message you want to flag. <strong class="bold">More</strong>, <strong class="bold">Flag</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Trash</strong> icons appear on the right (see <em class="italic">Figure 10.24</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Flag</strong> icon. A tiny colored flag appears in the right margin, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.25</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer301">
					<img alt="Figure 10.25 – A flagged message displays a flag icon in the right-hand margin&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.25_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.25 – A flagged message displays a flag icon in the right-hand margin</p>
			<p>To remove a flag from a message, just repeat the preceding steps. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor439"/>Dealing with junk email</h1>
			<p>Junk email typically involves scams, unwanted<a id="_idIndexMarker665"/> sales messages, and fake warnings. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on your iPhone does not sort junk messages from legitimate ones, but relies on your email provider to identify possible junk messages.</p>
			<p>Any time your email provider isn't sure whether a message is junk, it will send it to your <strong class="bold">Junk</strong> folder. That means you should periodically check for missing messages that have been sent to the <strong class="bold">Junk</strong> folder by mistake.</p>
			<p>Despite the efforts of your email <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>provider, junk messages will still slip through, so you need to know how to deal with junk when you receive it.</p>
			<p>To send a message to the <strong class="bold">Junk</strong> folder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap a folder. </li>
				<li>Swipe left on the message that you want to mark as junk. <strong class="bold">More</strong>, <strong class="bold">Flag</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Trash</strong> icons appear on the right. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">More</strong>. A list of options appears at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Scroll up to view all the options, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 10.26</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer302"><img alt="Figure 10.26 – The complete list of options displayed by tapping the More icon&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_10.26_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.26 – The complete list of options displayed by tapping the More icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Move to Junk</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've moved messages to the <strong class="bold">Junk</strong> folder or just want to check whether your email provider has sent any messages to the <strong class="bold">Junk</strong> folder for you to review, you'll need to browse inside the <strong class="bold">Junk</strong> folder.</p>
			<p>To browse through your <strong class="bold">Junk</strong> folder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the Back arrow in the upper-left corner until the <strong class="bold">Mailboxes</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Junk</strong> folder. A list of zero or more messages inside the <strong class="bold">Junk</strong> folder appears.</li>
				<li>Tap a message to read it, or swipe left and tap <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> to remove it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To avoid flooding your <strong class="bold">Junk</strong> folder with <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>obvious junk messages, your email provider may simply store all blatant junk messages on their own server. This means that if you want to check whether any important messages have been flagged as junk by mistake, you'll need to first check the <strong class="bold">Junk</strong> folder on your iPhone and then check the <strong class="bold">Spam</strong> folder of your email provider. To do this, you'll need to contact your email provider for details on how to examine the <strong class="bold">Spam</strong> folder of you<a id="_idTextAnchor440"/>r email account.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor441"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Sending and receiving email can help you stay in touch with important people and their messages wherever you go with your iPhone. At a basic level, make sure you know how to read and write messages. </p>
			<p>For greater convenience, learn how to reply to and forward messages. Replying to a message lets you include the text of a previous message and show your response. You can reply to the person sending that message or to everyone who received that same message.</p>
			<p>Forwarding lets you pass a message along to someone else. That way, you can share messages with your friends and co-workers so that they don't miss out on something important.</p>
			<p>On a more advanced level, use folders, filters, VIP lists, and flags to make it easier to find messages. The more messages you receive, the more you'll want to use these methods to help you find the messages that are most important to you.</p>
			<p>While email can be convenient, you might want to talk to someone right away. Instead of making a phone call, consider making a video call instead using FaceTime, which is the topic of the next chapter.</p>
