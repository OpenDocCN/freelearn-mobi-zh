			<p>Making a phone call can put you in touch with your friends and loved ones, but sometimes hearing their voice isn't enough. That's when you might want to use FaceTime, so that way people can hear yo<a id="_idTextAnchor443"/>ur voice and see you at the same time. </p>
			<p>FaceTime lets you talk and see up to 32 people at once, although it's far more likely you'll just talk to one person at a time or a handful of people at once.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note </p>
			<p class="callout">FaceTime calls only work if everyone uses an iPhone, iPad, or Macintosh. You cannot use FaceTime with someone using a Windows PC, Linux, or an Android smartphone or tablet. Also, FaceTime may not be available in all countries and regions.</p>
			<p>The topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting up FaceTime</li>
				<li>Making a FaceTime call</li>
				<li>Talking in a FaceTime call</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor444"/><a id="_idTextAnchor445"/><a id="_idTextAnchor446"/><a id="_idTextAnchor447"/>Setting up FaceTime</h1>
			<p>Before<a id="_idIndexMarker668"/> you can use FaceTime, you must define a phone number, Apple ID, or email address that people can use to call you through FaceTime. Two FaceTime options you may want to modify are <strong class="bold">Speaking</strong> and <strong class="bold">FaceTime Live Photos</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Speaking</strong> enlarges the title of the person speaking in a Group FaceTime chat so it's easier to see who's talking at any given time. If the <strong class="bold">Speaking</strong> option is turned off, the person's name will not appear enlarged.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">FaceTime Live Photos </strong>lets you capture live photos during a FaceTime call. </p>
			<p>To set up FaceTime, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> screen will appear.</li>
				<li>Scroll<a id="_idIndexMarker669"/> down and tap on <strong class="bold">FaceTime</strong>. A <strong class="bold">FaceTime</strong> screen will appear.</li>
				<li>Enter your phone number, email address, and Apple ID.</li>
				<li>(Optional) Tap the <strong class="bold">Speaking</strong> switch to turn it off or on.</li>
				<li>(Optional) Tap the <strong class="bold">FaceTime Live Photos</strong><strong class="bold"> </strong>switch to turn it off or on, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.1</em>:</li>
			</ol>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.1 – Choosing the Speaking and FaceTime Live <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>switches</p>
			<p>You can repeat the preceding steps in case you want to modify your FaceTime settings at any time. Once you've set up FaceTime on your iPhone, you can make and receive FaceTime calls.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor448"/>Using Wi-Fi for a FaceTime call</h2>
			<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker670"/>many parts of the world, users only get a monthly <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>data allotment. The moment they exceed this monthly data allotment, the cellular phone company charges extra. If you do not have an unlimited data plan, you may want to take some precautions first before using FaceTime.</p>
			<p>When you make a Facetime call, FaceTime first searches for a Wi-Fi network to connect to. Thus, FaceTime can be a handy way to make audio or video phone calls without using any cellular data whatsoever. </p>
			<p>If FaceTime cannot connect to a Wi-Fi network, then it will rely on a cellular data network. For those who must pay extra for data, a FaceTime video call will use up far more data than an ordinary phone call.</p>
			<p>So, if you want to make phone calls without paying for cellular data, make sure your iPhone is connected to a Wi-Fi network. You can check for a Wi-Fi connection by looking for the Wi-Fi icon in the upper-left corner of the iPhone screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.2</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.2 – Checking for a Wi-Fi connection&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.02_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.2 – Checking for a Wi-Fi connection</p>
			<p>To ensure that FaceTime won't use cellular data, you might want to temporarily turn off your iPhone's use of cellular data when you're making a FaceTime call. Then you can turn cellular data back on again afterward.</p>
			<p>To turn cellular data off (or on again), follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Cellular</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Cellular</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.3</em>. Depending on the region, you'll either see Cellular or Mobile Data: <div><img alt="Figure 11.3 – The Cellular screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.03_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.3 – The Cellular screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap<a id="_idIndexMarker672"/> the <strong class="bold">Cellular Data</strong> switch to turn it off (or on). When<a id="_idIndexMarker673"/> cellular data is off, your iPhone won't use any cellular data and will rely solely on a Wi-Fi network connection if one exists.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>FaceTime, through a Wi-Fi network, lets you make free phone calls without affecting your cellular data usage. If you have to watch your cellular data usage every month, consider using FaceTime to make free audio and/or video calls to everyone who owns an Apple product such as an iPhone, iPad, or Macintos<a id="_idTextAnchor449"/><a id="_idTextAnchor450"/>h.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor451"/>Making a FaceTime call</h1>
			<p>Once you have set up<a id="_idIndexMarker674"/> FaceTime, you can make calls to anyone you know who also has an iPhone, an iPad, or a Macintosh. (If someone uses an Android smartphone or tablet, or a computer that runs Windows, Linux, or Chrome OS, you will not be able to contact them using FaceTime.) </p>
			<p>Since FaceTime calls use the camera, make sure you're in an area where your camera won't accidentally capture images that you'd rather not broadcast to others. For example, it's easy to talk on a regular phone call while going to the restroom, but you probably wouldn't want to do that with a FaceTime call since someone could see exactly where you are and what you might be doing. </p>
			<p>To make a FaceTime call, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">FaceTime</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">FaceTime</strong> screen will appear. If you have made or received FaceTime calls in the past, a list of all your previous calls appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.4</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 11.4 – The FaceTime screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.4 – The FaceTime scre<a id="_idTextAnchor452"/><a id="_idTextAnchor453"/>en</p></li>
				<li>Tap a name, email address, or phone number that you want to call. If you want to call someone<a id="_idIndexMarker675"/> who's name, email address, or phone number does not appear on the FaceTime list of previous calls, tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> button in the upper-right corner to display a <strong class="bold">New FaceTime</strong> screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.5</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 11.5 – The New FaceTime screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.5 – The New FaceTime screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the <strong class="bold">To</strong>: text field and type an email address or phone number that you want to call. If you tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon inside the circle, the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app opens, allowing you to <a id="_idIndexMarker676"/>choose a name stored in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. </li>
				<li>Tap the FaceTime icon displayed under the name of the person you want to call. <strong class="bold">Audio</strong> and <strong class="bold">Video</strong> buttons appear, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.6</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 11.6 – Choosing to make an audio or video call&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.6 – Choosing to make an audio or video call</p></li>
				<li>(Optional) Repeat <em class="italic">Step 3</em> for each<a id="_idIndexMarker677"/> additional person you want to join the FaceTime call.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Audio</strong> or <strong class="bold">Video</strong> button. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>When you call using FaceTime, each person will see a banner at the top of the screen that they can tap to display an incoming FaceTime screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.7</em>: </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.7 – Receiving a FaceTime call request&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.07_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.7 – Receiving a FaceTime call request</p>
			<p>At this point, each<a id="_idIndexMarker678"/> person can tap <strong class="bold">Decline</strong> or <strong class="bold">Accept</strong>. If someone tries to FaceTime you but you fail to answer because you're busy or just didn't have your iPhone with you at the time the FaceTime call request arrived, a notification appears in the upper-right corner of the FaceTime app on the Home Screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.8</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 11.8 – FaceTime notifications&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.08_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.8 – FaceTime notifications</p>
			<p>This notification<a id="_idIndexMarker679"/> lets you know not only that someone tried to FaceTime you, but also how many FaceTime requests you may have misse<a id="_idTextAnchor454"/><a id="_idTextAnchor455"/>d. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor456"/>Talking in a FaceTime call</h1>
			<p>Once you<a id="_idIndexMarker680"/> connect through FaceTime as a video call, you'll see your own video image, along with video images of all the other callers, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.9</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt=" Figure 11.9 – Viewing different callers in FaceTime&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.09_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"> Figure 11.9 – Viewing different callers in FaceTime</p>
			<p>Now, let's look at the different options we can use once we are on the call.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor457"/>Adding multiple people to a FaceTime call</h2>
			<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker681"/>many cases, FaceTime calls occur between two people. However, you can have up to 32 people involved in a FaceTime call. When you create a FaceTime call, you can simply add as many people as you wish by tapping the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon when you initiate a FaceTime call (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.6</em>).</p>
			<p>While you're in the middle of a FaceTime call, you can always include more people as well. To add more people during a FaceTime call, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Swipe up from the horizontal handle above the <strong class="bold">mute</strong> and <strong class="bold">flip</strong> icons (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.9</em>). The entire screen displays FaceTime options, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.10</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 11.10 – Viewing different callers in FaceTime&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.10_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.10 – Viewing different callers in FaceTime</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+ Add Person</strong> button. An <strong class="bold">Add Person</strong> screen appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.5</em>).</li>
				<li>Repeat <em class="italic">Step 2</em> for each additional person you want to add to the FaceTime call, up to <a id="_idIndexMarker682"/>a maximum of 32 people.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Having multiple people on a FaceTime call can be fun to share ideas, but remember that everyone needs a fast cellular or Wi-Fi connection to make the FaceTime call work. Once you start talking to one or more people, you might want to add different effects to your image for fun. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor458"/>Using visual effect filters in FaceTime</h2>
			<p>Visual effect filters let<a id="_idIndexMarker683"/> you alter the picture of the person you're talking to through FaceTime. That way, you can alter their video image to make it easier to see them or just to get creative and make them look odd or funny. </p>
			<p>You can modify your own image in different ways by tapping any of the following buttons at the bottom of a FaceTime screen:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Effects</strong>: Offers different visual effects for your own video image</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Mute</strong>: Toggles between turning your microphone on or off</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Flip</strong>: Toggles between the front-facing or back-facing camera</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">End</strong>: Ends a FaceTime call</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you modify your own image, other people on the FaceTime call will see your changes as well. This lets you create humorous effects or allows you to highlight something important to others. </p>
			<p>To apply a visual effect filter during a FaceTime call, follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button on the FaceTime screen. Buttons representing different types of effects appear as the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button appears highlighted, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 11.11 – Various effects options&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.11_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.11 – Various effects options</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Filter button</strong> on the<a id="_idIndexMarker684"/> far left to see a list of different filters you can apply to the currently displayed image. Then, scroll left or right until you find a filter you like, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.12</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 11.12 – Choosing a filter&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.12 – Choosing a filter</p></li>
				<li>Tap the close (<strong class="bold">X</strong>) icon in the upper-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Filters</strong> area to exit out of the filters options and<a id="_idIndexMarker685"/> the list of visual effect option buttons appears again (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Filters can alter the visual appearance of images, but you may want to add text to an image so you can identify items for other people to see. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor459"/>Adding text to a FaceTime image</h2>
			<p>Text can appear<a id="_idIndexMarker686"/> on your image, which can be handy if you point your <a id="_idIndexMarker687"/>camera at something and type text to identify it, such as while showing others how to repair an appliance. Then, text can identify the name of the parts others are seeing. </p>
			<p>To add text to your image during a FaceTime call, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button on the FaceTime screen. Buttons representing different types of effects appear as the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button appears highlighted (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Text</strong> button (which appears as the second button from the left). A list of different text styles appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.13</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 11.13 – Choosing a variety of text styles&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.13_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.13 – Choosing a variety of text styles</p></li>
				<li>Tap a<a id="_idIndexMarker688"/> text style. The word <strong class="bold">Text</strong> appears on the <a id="_idIndexMarker689"/>image and a virtual keyboard appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.14</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 11.14 – Creating text on an image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.14 – Creating text on an image</p></li>
				<li>Type <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>any text you wish. If you want to delete text, tap <a id="_idIndexMarker691"/>the close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon that appears in the upper-left corner of the text.</li>
				<li>Tap the close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon in the upper-right corner of the Text area to exit out of the text options. The list of visual effect option buttons appears again (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Text can <a id="_idIndexMarker692"/>help describe items in an image, but sometimes you<a id="_idIndexMarker693"/> may just want to add silly pictures to an image for fun.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor460"/>Adding shapes to a FaceTime image</h2>
			<p>FaceTime<a id="_idIndexMarker694"/> provides a collection of silly images and shapes<a id="_idIndexMarker695"/> you can put on an image. These provide simple animation that can highlight certain parts of an image for others to see.</p>
			<p>To add a shape to a FaceTime image, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button on the FaceTime screen. Buttons representing different types of effects appear as the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button appears highlighted (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Shapes</strong> button (which appears as the third button from the left). A list of different shapes appears at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Double-tap on a shape to place it on the image, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.15</em>. If you want to delete a shape, tap the close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon that appears in the upper-left corner of the shape:<div><img alt="Figure 11.15 – Adding a shape to an image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.15 – Adding a shape to an image</p></li>
				<li>Tap the close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon in the<a id="_idIndexMarker696"/> upper-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Shapes</strong> area<a id="_idIndexMarker697"/> to exit out of the shapes options. The list of visual effect option buttons appears again (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Similar to shapes are activities, which provide animated images such as miniature cartoons.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor461"/>Adding activities to a FaceTime image</h2>
			<p>Activities give <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>you yet another way to spice up images with tiny cartoons. To <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>add an activity to a FaceTime image, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button on the FaceTime screen. Buttons representing different types of effects appear as the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button appears highlighted (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Fitness</strong> button (which appears as the fourth button from the left). A list of different activities will appear at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Double-tap on an activity to place it on the image, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.16</em>. If you want to delete an activity, tap the close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon that appears in the upper-left corner:<div><img alt="Figure 11.16 – Adding an activity to a FaceTime image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.16_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.16 – Adding an activity to a FaceTime image</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <a id="_idIndexMarker700"/>close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon in the upper-right corner of the <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>activities area to exit out of the activity options. The list of visual effect option buttons appears again (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Yet another way to create interesting visual effects is to add memojis, which are little cartoon faces.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor462"/>Adding memojis to a FaceTime image</h2>
			<p>Memojis represent <a id="_idIndexMarker702"/>silly cartoon faces of animals such as a cow, mouse, or<a id="_idIndexMarker703"/> shark. Adding memojis are mostly for humorous and entertainment purposes. </p>
			<p>To add a memoji to a FaceTime image, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button on the FaceTime screen. Buttons representing different types of effects appear as the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button appears highlighted (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Memoji</strong> button (which appears as the fifth button from the left). A list of different memojis appears at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Double-tap on a memoji to place it on the image, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.17</em>. If you want to delete a memoji, tap the close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon that appears in the upper-left corner:<div><img alt="Figure 11.17 – Adding a memoji to a FaceTime image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.17 – Adding a memoji to a FaceTime image</p></li>
				<li>Tap the<a id="_idIndexMarker704"/> close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon in the upper-right corner of<a id="_idIndexMarker705"/> the memoji area to exit out of the memoji options. The list of visual effect option buttons appears again (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A final way to <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>spice up a FaceTime image is to add emojis, which are <a id="_idIndexMarker707"/>animated images of common objects, such as stars, hearts, or light bulbs.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor463"/>Adding emojis to a FaceTime image</h2>
			<p>An emoji <a id="_idIndexMarker708"/>represents a simple, animated image that you can place in<a id="_idIndexMarker709"/> a FaceTime image for humorous or decorative purposes, or to express emotions in a visual manner.</p>
			<p>To add an emoji to a FaceTime image, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button on the FaceTime screen. Buttons representing different types of effects appear as the <strong class="bold">effects</strong> button appears highlighted (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Emoji</strong> button (which appears as the sixth button from the left). A list of different emojis appears at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Double-tap on an emoji to place it on the image, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 11.18</em>. If you want to delete an emoji, tap the close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon that appears in the upper-left corner:<div><img alt="Figure 11.18 – Adding an emoji to a FaceTime image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_11.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.18 – Adding an emoji to a FaceTime image</p></li>
				<li>Tap the<a id="_idIndexMarker710"/> close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon in the upper-right corner of <a id="_idIndexMarker711"/>the Emoji area to exit out of the emoji options. The list of visual effect option buttons appears again (see <em class="italic">Figure 11.11</em>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Emojis, like all visual effects, give you different ways to express yourself while chatting through FaceTime. You can use all, some, or none of these options. For example, you might not want to use any visual effects when chatting in relation to a business call, but you may want to get creative when chatting with a <a id="_idTextAnchor464"/>loved one or close friend.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor465"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>FaceTime gives you a chance to make visual phone calls, which can be handy for talking and seeing a loved one or helping you show someone an item or scene around you. By connecting to a Wi-Fi network, you can make free phone calls without affecting any monthly data allotment that might restrict how many phone calls you can make. </p>
			<p>For entertainment, consider using FaceTime's various visual effects, such as displaying text or animated cartoon images. Such visual effects can make a video call through FaceTime even more entertaining and enjoyable.</p>
			<p>FaceTime gives you yet another way to communicate with others with your iPhone, just as long as you only want to talk to people who also have an iPhone, iPad, or Macintosh. </p>
			<p>While FaceTime can be a way to entertain yourself with others, you can also turn your iPhone into an ebook reader so that you can entertain yourself wherever you take your iPhone.</p>
