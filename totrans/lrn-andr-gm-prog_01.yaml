- en: It all started way back in 2005 when Google acquired a new company, which would
    later change the course of mobile computing for good. Yes, you guessed it right! The
    company that was acquired was the developer of the Android operating system. Since
    then, Android has seen a lot of developments and has grown significantly in terms
    of its user base because of the might of Google. At the time of writing this book,
    Android N is the latest version of this OS. Market share of Android has been growing
    ever since and is currently at 87.6% of total mobile computing devices. This is
    huge, and therefore, from a developer perspective, it is extremely important to
    develop for this platform because most of the mobile base are Android users.

    is, one specific field, that is, game development. Mobile games account for the
    highest number of downloads on the Google Play Store, and, therefore, this is
    a most exciting time for game developers since Google has established a massive
    distribution channel and has made it extremely easy for mobile game developers
    to publish their games. Gone are the days when you’d have to wait for months or
    even years to crack a publishing deal with a major publisher. In today's times,
    you can simply sign up on Google Play Store as a developer and in a matter of
    hours publish your first game, if it is ready, and get feedback from live users.

    Candy Crush, Subway Surfers, and so on. Even games with simple gameplay, such
    as Flappy Bird, have done extremely well, and it was estimated that at the game’s
    peak it was earning around $50,000 per day in ad revenues. Isn’t that exciting?
    You are just one click away from getting your game to a potential audience of
    billions, and, if your game gets noticed, then you’ll be having the time of your
    life.

    Execution Manager** (**Intel HAXM**) or **Kernel-based Virtual Machine** (**KVM**),
    which are types of hypervisors. If the needed hypervisor isn't installed, Android
    Studio typically prompts you to install it. Without acceleration, the emulator
    takes the machine code from the VM and translates it block-by-block to conform
    to the architecture of the host computer. This process can be quite slow. However,
    if the VM and the architecture of the host computer matches (such as x86 on x86),
    the emulator can skip translating the code and simply run it directly on the actual
    CPU using a hypervisor. In this case, the emulator can approach the speed of your
    actual computer.

- en: Before you start a new project in Android Studio, there are some basic concepts
    you must be familiar with. So, let's take a look at a few common terms we will
    be dealing with in our chapters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Package names
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing that you will come across is something called a **Package Name**.
    It's quite easy to understand actually. A package name is simply like a reverse
    URL. Think of a package name as your app's domain name-just like a website, only
    in reverse. For instance, you can think of `www.google.com` as a website's domain
    name; in exactly the same way, the naming convention of an Android app is the
    reverse of a website. So, you can name your app something like `com.google.www`.
    There is no strict rule that says that your package name must start from `com`,
    but it is the most commonly accepted convention. You can also name your package
    name randomly using your own set of conventions, such as `abc.xyz.lmn`, `mygame.mycompany.myname`, and
    so on. Also, it is extremely important to note that package names must be unique
    and should not match the package name of any other existing app on the Google
    Play Store.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It is very important to choose a unique package name since the URL gets indexed
    by Google and is crucial for your game or app to be noticed on the Google Play
    Store. So, ensure that you use a unique package name for your game. Also, another
    interesting fact is that you can predict your app''s URL even before it goes live
    if you have finalized it on your package name. For this reason, you cannot use
    the same package name of another app since it''s already live on Google Play Store.
    Your app will be live according to the following URL convention:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=*package_name_here*`'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So, if your package name is `abc.xyz.lmn`, then your app''s URL will be as
    follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=abc.xyz.lmn`'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Layouts
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next concept is Layouts. We will be dealing with Layouts in the next chapter
    but, just to give you a small introduction, let's provide a few examples. We will make
    a game, and in a game, we do not need to display the **status bar**, which means
    that we need to have a **Fullscreen Layout**. If you were making an app, then
    you probably would not mind allowing the status bar to be displayed on top. So,
    in this case, you can use a **Relative Layout** or **Linear Layout**. The really
    interesting aspect of this book is that, by the end, you will also have a basic
    idea of how to create a non-gaming app as well. So, it is highly recommended that
    you grasp the knowledge of the first three chapters properly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Android Manifest file
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important concept while making an Android app or a game is the `Android
    Manifest` file. To explain this file simply, it contains all the rules or, in
    more generalized terms, **Permissions** needed for an app. You must have observed
    on Google Play Store that, before you download any app, you are prompted with
    a dialog box that tells you what permissions are needed for the app to run. These
    permissions are basic rules that are needed to be fed in the `Android Manifest` file
    in order to have a transparency to let your user know what information is going
    to be taken from them. So, for instance, if an app requires access to the Internet,
    then it is required for the developer to make sure that they include the Internet
    permission in the manifest file. If the developer does not write this permission
    in the manifest file, then the app will not be able to access the said functionality,
    and the same goes for accessing contacts, gallery, camera, and everything else.
