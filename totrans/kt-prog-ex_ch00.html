<p class="mce-root">Since its announcement as an officially supported language for Android, Kotlin has experienced a huge rise in popularity. This proliferation in popularity is in many ways warranted as Kotlin is a modern and extremely well-designed language, which has many domains of application—web, mobile, and native to name a few. As a direct consequence of its rise in popularity, Kotlin has experienced steady growth over the years.</p>

<p>This book will be useful to readers of all ages, experience levels, and demographics. That being said, it was written primarily with beginners and experienced programmers who want to learn Kotlin in mind.</p>
<p>Over the course of writing this book, I paid special attention to the fact that beginners will need to be eased into topics and concepts. As such, the chapters of this book were written in ascending order of difficulty. If you are a beginner, this will enable you to learn as quickly as possible with as few hiccups as possible.</p>
<p>Fairly experienced readers are expected to move more quickly through this book than beginners—all things being equal. If you have prior experience of programming and application development, you may choose to first run through the code examples of this book to get a good feel for the topics covered and what to expect. Java developers in particular may be able to get away with diving right into the more advanced chapters of the book.&#160;</p>
<p>Regardless of which category of user you fall into, rest assured that there is something that has been written specially for you!&#160;</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>In Java, an&#160;</span><kbd>HttpsURLConnection</kbd><span>&#160;can be used for secure data transfer over a network</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>release {<br/>  storeFile file("../my-release-key.jks")<br/>  storePassword "password"<br/>  keyAlias "my-alias"<br/>  keyPassword "password"<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>release {<br/>  storeFile file("../my-release-key.jks")<br/>  <strong>storePassword "password"</strong><br/>  keyAlias "my-alias"<br/>  keyPassword "password"<br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">./gradlew assembleRelease</span></strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Enter the rest of your account details as required and click&#160;<span class="packt_screen">COMPLETE REGISTRATION</span>&#160;to finish the account registration process.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
