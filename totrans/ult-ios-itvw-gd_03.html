			<h1 id="_idParaDest-37" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor042" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Going through the Interview Process</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Many candidates (or even employers) summarize iOS development as primarily “Swift”. But narrowing the iOS developer role to just a programming language is a very simplistic way of looking at it. An iOS developer (in fact, any developer) has a bundle of capabilities, even if we don’t feel that way. We must show knowledge not only in Swift but also in computer science. Some iOS development fundamentals are also essential, such as UIKit <span>or Foundation.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Being an iOS developer doesn’t sum up to just coding skills. A senior iOS developer must design a robust app with a clean architecture, write unit tests, manage CI/CD processes, deploy beta/alpha versions, manage certificates, and <span>provision profiles.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">And what about some soft skills? Communication and time management are essentials in today’s <span>dynamic market.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">As we can tell from the pointers we just discussed, being an iOS developer means a bundle of capabilities, much, much more than Swift itself. The hiring process goal is to cover all of our abilities, from hard to <span>soft skills.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we will learn about the different stages of a standard iOS developer hiring process. By the end of the chapter, we will be in a position where the process will be familiar for us as if we were <span>actually there!</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">To that end, we will cover <span>the following:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">Understanding the <span>hiring process</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">Getting ready for the <span>screening interview</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">All about the iOS <span>technical interview</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">Cracking the <span>coding interview</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">Passing the <span>architecture interview</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">As I said, let’s begin with understanding how the hiring <span>process works.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor043" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Understanding the hiring process</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">One of the goals of the hiring process<a id="_idIndexMarker065" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> is to get a complete picture (as much as possible) of the candidate’s skills, both hard <span>and soft.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Soft and hard skills</p>
			<p class="callout">If you don’t remember what<a id="_idIndexMarker066" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> soft and hard skills are, <strong class="bold">hard skills</strong> are role-specific, such as iOS coding, GitHub knowledge, and more. <strong class="bold">Soft skills</strong> are skills that are relevant for many jobs. Communication<a id="_idIndexMarker067" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> and leadership are examples of soft skills. Refer to <a href="B18653_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a> for <span>more information.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Think of our candidate picture as a <span>giant puzzle.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">When we start the hiring process, each stage puts together another piece of the puzzle, and the process helps our hiring manager see our skill set before <span>they offer.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Each stage examines a different part of our picture as an iOS candidate and, like a knockout tournament, determines whether the newly revealed part of the picture is good enough to proceed to the <span>next stage.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor044" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Learning the hiring funnel</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">I mentioned a knockout tournament <a id="_idIndexMarker068" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>just to catch your eye. The reality is that the hiring process looks more like a funnel. Each stage of the funnel goes deeper and reveals more <span>advanced skills.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here’s an example of such <span>a funnel:</span></p>
			<div class="calibre2">
				<div id="_idContainer011" class="img---figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.1_B18653.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – A standard funnel" class="calibre4"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – A standard funnel</p>
			<p class="calibre3">It is called a “funnel” because<a id="_idIndexMarker069" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> it gets narrowed as we move down and more candidates <span>drop out.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">But how does that funnel look in the specific workplace that we <span>interview for?</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor045" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Distinguishing between different companies</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The funnel we see in <span><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> is just an example. Every company has a different hiring process, and there are no rules in <span>this domain.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">There are a couple of reasons for <span>that difference:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Different roles</strong> require different stages and different <a id="_idIndexMarker070" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>topics to check. The different role is not just a developer versus a designer, but also a developer versus a <span>team lead.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">Each company has its <strong class="bold">own view</strong> of how such a funnel should look. Some focus on personality, and others focus on coding. Each company has its own DNA (remember that in <a href="B18653_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, we compared companies to humans), and therefore looks for a specific type of candidate. This candidate type can be quickly learned from looking at the hiring process. Look at the following two examples (<span><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><span><em class="italic">.2</em></span><span>):</span></li>
			</ul>
			<div class="calibre2">
				<div id="_idContainer012" class="img---figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.2_B18653.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Different funnels for different roles" class="calibre4"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="img---caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – Different funnels for different roles</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We can see that role <strong class="bold">A</strong> focuses heavily on coding skills while role <strong class="bold">B</strong> is more about design and architecture. It might be different roles (developer versus tech lead), but it can also show how the company or the team sees the developer position. In small companies or teams, the developer is much more central and has more responsibility. In this case, role <strong class="bold">B</strong> sounds more suitable for a startup company than a <span>corporate one.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The last thing that can affect the funnel is the <strong class="bold">product</strong>. A front-facing product may require high UI skills. Focusing on screen design and UIKit/SwiftUI as part of the process sounds like a <span>good idea.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">So, here’s another (free) tip: we saw in <a href="B18653_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a> that we can learn a lot about the team and the role just by looking<a id="_idIndexMarker071" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> at the job posting. Now, we can see that the hiring process can also teach us a lot about the job and the working <span>place expectations.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Now, let’s start our funnel journey with a short but essential interview: the <span>screening interview.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-41" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor046" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Getting ready for the screening interview</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">In most cases, the first step<a id="_idIndexMarker072" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> in the hiring process won’t be an in-depth and advanced <span>technical interview.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We succeeded in passing the resume scanning step and getting an interview, but at this stage, we are among many other candidates that also had that luck. Yet, with so many candidates, the workplace must filter as much as possible with minimal effort before it moves to the next stage. That’s what the screening interview is <span>all about.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Think of the screening interview as an oversized, coarse filter in the hiring funnel that needs to handle a large number of candidates in a short time. It also means we have about 30 minutes to impress our interviewer to move down the funnel while answering several <span>important questions.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor047" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>What does the screening interview include?</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Most screening interviews<a id="_idIndexMarker073" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> revolve around three topics – the company, the candidate’s profile, and <span>soft/hard skills.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Let’s talk about the company</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Usually, the interviewer <a id="_idIndexMarker074" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>starts the interview with an <strong class="bold">elevator pitch</strong> about the company<a id="_idIndexMarker075" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> and its product. I want to clarify what an elevator pitch means because we will need <span>it soon.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s imagine ourselves going up in an elevator with another person. We want to present an idea or even ourselves to that person, but we have around 30 seconds before the elevator’s destination. That short presentation is called an <span>elevator pitch.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In a screening interview, there are two elevator pitches. The first is the interviewer talking about the company and its product. The second is ours, and we will discuss <span>that soon.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The interviewer’s elevator pitch may last more than 30 seconds. What we need to do on our side is to listen carefully to the company and product description. Here are a <span>few reasons:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">Remember we talked about making sure the workplace is suited for us in <a href="B18653_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>? Now is the time to <strong class="bold">verify our assumptions</strong>. In <a href="B18653_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, we invested precious time in research. Now is the time to find out the truth. Is this the company we want to work at? Is the development team really at the size we were expecting? Do we hear something that bothers us? We should take advantage of <span>that chance.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">“Is this going to be on the test?” Well, kind of. At the end of the screening interview, the interviewer will ask us if we have questions and will expect us to ask some. We will talk about this point, but we need to ensure we understand the interviewer’s pitch so that we can ask <strong class="bold">relevant questions</strong>. Asking questions that were answered in the pitch is not a <span>good idea.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">The interviewer’s pitch can help us <strong class="bold">adjust our answers</strong> to what the workplace is looking for. We need to use the additional and precious information we just got and leverage our offering as <span>iOS developers.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">But the interviewer<a id="_idIndexMarker076" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> is not the only one that speaks in this conversation<a id="_idIndexMarker077" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> or has an elevator pitch – we are also a part of <span>the interview!</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Building our elevator pitch</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">At some point, the interviewer<a id="_idIndexMarker078" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> will say, “Please tell<a id="_idIndexMarker079" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> me about yourself.” That will be our turn to present our <span>elevator pitch.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">They say each of us needs to be a little bit of a salesperson, and it’s true. Even though our specialization is iOS development, we’ve got a significant lead, and we need to sell something – our skills and expertise as <span>iOS developers.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Therefore, it is extremely important to <strong class="bold">plan our elevator pitch ahead</strong> and come to this moment fully prepared. It is recommended to write down our pitch, read it out loud, practice in front of a mirror, and even<a id="_idIndexMarker080" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> read it to a close friend. The interviewer<a id="_idIndexMarker081" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> needs to remember us. That’s how important <span>it is!</span></p>
			<h4 class="calibre16">What do we want the interviewer to remember about us?</h4>
			<p class="calibre3">So how do we build our pitch? First, we need to remember there’s no need to unfold our entire resume. The interviewer<a id="_idIndexMarker082" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> probably read it already. Even if they didn’t, listing our expertise in 40-50 seconds <span>is ineffective.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We need to explain <strong class="bold">why we fit the job</strong>, and there are two simple pitch formulas: present, past, and future, and past, present, <span>and future:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">With “present, past, and future,” we start by explaining our current role, move to our expertise, and then discuss why we think we are qualified for <span>the job.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">In “past, present, and future”, we start with our expertise, move to our current role, and finish by explaining why we are qualified for <span>the job.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Both formulas are great – both have smart logic built in, and both will do the job. But we can tune our <span>pitch better.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">It may be a good idea to start our pitch with our current role if it’s somehow related to the job posting. However, if our past expertise is more related to the job requirements, we should start with our expertise and only then move to what we are <span>doing now.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Now that we have a formula, we need to remember there’s a short time to present our profile. The right approach distills our expertise and current role to achievements and influence. We must market ourselves and not fill our interviewer with dry work <span>history details.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In the “future” part, we need to include our expectations from the hiring process and job searching. Mixing our ambitions and workplace requirements will result in a significant “<span>future” part.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s try to spice things up with clickbait now that we have <span>a formula.</span></p>
			<h4 class="calibre16">Including clickbait</h4>
			<p class="calibre3">We are all likely familiar<a id="_idIndexMarker083" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> with the term “clickbait.” If you don’t know what it means, clickbait is text or a picture designed to <strong class="bold">attract the listener</strong> or the reader to consume<a id="_idIndexMarker084" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> more content. It’s a common practice in tweets, posts, <span>and articles.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Yes, I know an elevator pitch is not a tweet or a post, but the human brain works the same. A clickbait/teaser creates a “curiosity gap” and exploits it. In our pitch, we need to do <span>the same!</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We aim to plant a piece of information that makes us unique and will drive the reviewer to drill down and listen for more. This piece of information will also help us <span>be memorable.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are examples of <span>some teasers:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">“I constantly speak <span>at conferences”</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">“I have a side project on the app store with many <span>active users”</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">“I’m a participant in two big open <span>source projects”</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Of course, it goes without saying that the teaser you plant needs to be accurate and reliable. Twisting the truth won’t look good when your reviewer starts to <span>dig in.</span></p>
			<h4 class="calibre16">What not to include in your pitch</h4>
			<p class="calibre3">The answer to what <em class="italic">not</em> to include in your pitch may differ between countries and cultures. But I think it is best practice<a id="_idIndexMarker085" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> not to include personal beliefs, religion, and anything unrelated to being a great iOS developer. It can even hurt our chances of moving forward with <span>the process.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Saying bad words about our previous workplaces is also not a good idea. It is better to say that even though we might have had issues and conflicts with a specific place in the past, we appreciate the time <span>working there.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Remember that we should never act emotionally in these situations. Being smart is extremely important in <span>job interviews.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Now let’s talk about some seriously thoughtful questions such as why we want to <span>change jobs.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Preparing for the “Why do you want to change jobs?” question</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">If our elevator pitch follows one of the formulas I previously mentioned, it should also cover this question in the “<span>future” section.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">However, the interviewer<a id="_idIndexMarker086" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> can still question us about our motivation to change our current workplace. Maybe because they weren’t listening carefully, or because we had only 30-40 seconds, and it’s just <span>not enough.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">There are many reasons why a candidate would like to change their job. Here are some <span>of them:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">I don’t like <span>my company</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">I want <span>higher pay</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">I’m looking <span>for opportunities</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">I’m doing it <span>personal reasons</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">I <span>want flexibility</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">I <span>got fired</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">I don’t like the culture in <span>my company</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">I don’t get timely training <span>and development</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Each one of these reasons is perfectly legit. But there are different ways we can present our reason to <span>the interviewer.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s take, for example, the reason <em class="italic">“I want </em><span><em class="italic">higher pay.”</em></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We can just answer <span>the following:</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">My current salary is too low, and my workplace won’t give me </em><span><em class="italic">a raise.</em></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Well, that doesn’t sound too good, does it? Not only does it sounds whiny, but it also may raise some eyebrows – perhaps there’s a reason why we didn’t get <span>that raise.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">On the other hand, we can send a <span>different message:</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">I like taking challenges, and getting rewards motivates me to work harder. For me, financial support works as a reward for my </em><span><em class="italic">hard work.</em></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">It is better to tie up salary and motivation than salary and ego. It also gives depth to the statement, “I want <span>higher pay.”</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">When we pick the<a id="_idIndexMarker087" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> right reason, we should consider how to formulate it with a positive attitude and tie it to a value the <span>workplace requires.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Preparing for the skills test</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">As I said, a screening interview<a id="_idIndexMarker088" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> is like a giant coarse filter. Besides expertise<a id="_idIndexMarker089" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> and personal expectations, there’s another criterion the interviewer may check us on: a <span>skills test.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The skills test is much narrower than the advanced process stages. Remember, the interviewer may not be our hiring manager or an iOS developer. In addition, we’ve got minimal time – after all, it’s just a <span>screening interview.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, the skills test is an important part that we should be ready for, and we’ll start with discussing our <span>soft skills.</span></p>
			<h4 class="calibre16">Discovering the soft skills questions</h4>
			<p class="calibre3">The soft-skills test<a id="_idIndexMarker090" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> is tricky! No one will tell us, <em class="italic">“Ok, now we are going to check your soft skills."</em> Our soft skills are examined throughout the interview in various places. Our elevator pitch is one of those places where our soft skills might be shown, but not the <span>only place.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">If we were late for the interview, it might point to <strong class="bold">bad time management</strong> or personal maturity, and that’s one example. <strong class="bold">Communication skills</strong> may arise when talking about what it was like working<a id="_idIndexMarker091" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> as part of a team <span>or remotely.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We should see every part or every side of the interview as part of the soft-skills test that we are <span>tested on.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Soft skills are there even in the way we answer hard-skills questions. Remember those? Let’s talk about them for <span>a second.</span></p>
			<h4 class="calibre16">Answering hard skills questions</h4>
			<p class="calibre3">Unlike soft skills, the hard-skills<a id="_idIndexMarker092" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> test is much clearer. Not every screening interview contains hard skills, and it depends on the workplace we are <span>interviewing for.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">A hard-skills test may contain basic questions about Swift and UIKit. Their primary purpose is not to check our Swift programming skills level but to ensure we pass the minimum bar to continue <span>the process.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We need to remember that the interviewer may not even be an iOS developer at this stage, and they may have a list of questions <span>and answers.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">A typical fundamental question <span>might be:</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">What is the difference between let </em><span><em class="italic">and var?</em></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The preceding question may look extremely basic to a standard iOS developer. Still, we must remember that the interviewer doesn’t know our <strong class="bold">actual</strong> experience and knowledge at this stage. An iOS developer or a recruiter can ask that question because an answer such as <em class="italic">“I don’t remember”</em> is a strong signal the candidate may have worrying gaps in their knowledge of the <span>Swift language.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In screening interviews, there will probably be several multiple-choice questions so that non-developer interviewers can ask and analyze <span>the answer.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">Part 2, Swift Language and Coding</em> of this book discusses the Swift language, and meticulously reviewing its chapters will greatly prepare us for most screening <span>interview questions.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">For now, let’s move to another hidden soft skill in the interview: the ability to <span>ask questions.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Asking, “Do you have any questions for me?”</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">The interviewer isn’t the only<a id="_idIndexMarker093" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> one who asks questions. We <span>do too.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">That won’t be the last time we ask our interviewer questions during the hiring process. In reality, asking the interviewer questions is another task in the screening interview and probably in all the <span>other discussions.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In other words, the answer to “Do you have any questions for me?” is always, always “yes.” Answering “no” to that question will significantly reduce our chances of getting an offer at the end of the process, and I must say – rightfully. A candidate with no questions is considered uninterested<a id="_idIndexMarker094" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> in the workplace he is <span>interviewing for.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Like any other stage, we should prepare. And in this case <a id="_idTextAnchor048" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>– with a pool <span>of questions.</span></p>
			<h4 class="calibre16">Creating a pool of questions</h4>
			<p class="calibre3">Sure, we can just prepare a question<a id="_idIndexMarker095" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> before the interview. But what if the answer to that question is already covered during the talk? The trick is to prepare a list of questions, and that list will be great not only for the screening interview but for other interviews <span>as well.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Each different question shows another side of our personality. Sounds weird, right? Let’s look at some examples and how <span>they work:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">Can you tell me more about the day-to-day responsibilities of the role?</em> We show our desire to meet the <span>employer’s expectations.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">How could I impress you in the first three months?</em>  This shows that we think of how to make a <span>positive contribution.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">Are there opportunities for training and progression within the role/company?</em> We are serious about our career and are committed to the <span>company’s future.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">Where do you think the company is headed in the next five years?</em> We show interest in the company and a commitment to a <span>long-term relationship.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">Can you describe the working culture of the organization?</em> We show maturity and motivation to <span>fit it.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">Can you tell me more about the team I would be working in?</em> We show interest in teamwork <span>and communication.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Do you want to pick the side you want to emphasize? Just select the right question – it’s like a restaurant menu! We can see that even a question (not an answer) can send a signal to the interviewer and leverage <span>our chances.</span></p>

			<p class="calibre3">And here’s an excellent tip relevant<a id="_idIndexMarker096" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> to interviews and meetings and any meaningful communication<a id="_idIndexMarker097" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> we may have – sending a thank-you email right after the interview can have significant advantages if it’s <span>done right.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Now, why send an email? Doesn’t the interviewer already have our email address and other communication methods? Aren’t we on <span>his list?</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">So, we need to remember that the interviewer doesn’t look at us only as iOS developers but also as humans. Sending a thank-you email shows that we are a person that appreciates the interviewer’s time and has <span>excellent manners.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">But a thank-you email also provides two additional advantages: the ability to add more information we didn't have the chance to show during the interview and our signature with important links we want them <span>to see.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Remember that a thank-you email is not just two words but more. But exactly how <span>muc<a id="_idTextAnchor050" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>h more?</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Learning what to write</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">A thank-you email should be short<a id="_idIndexMarker098" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> and focused. Writing more than a couple of paragraphs is too much for an interviewer to digest – after all, we are talki<a id="_idTextAnchor051" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>ng about a <span>screening interview.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The email should begin with expressing gratitude to the interviewer for their time and reiterating interest in the position. We then need to remind the interviewer of our qualifications for the role by <strong class="bold">highlighting our expertise </strong><span><strong class="bold">and skills</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">And now, for our signature, which should contain <strong class="bold">links to our LinkedIn profile</strong> and personal blogs we <span>may have.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We need to consider our thank-you email as a personal stamp that should go along with you after you finish your screening interview. As long as it has been done with good taste, it impacts our chances to move with <span>the process.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Next, let’s prepare for the main dish: the iOS <span>technical interview.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-44" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor052" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>All about the iOS technical interview</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">The term “technical interview” is too broad, in my<a id="_idIndexMarker099" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> opinion. Does it mean coding with Swift? Questions about <span>UIKit? Design?</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">When we get an invitation for a technical interview, it mostly means that we are expected to show our general knowledge of <span>iOS development.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">No, it doesn’t mean that there won’t be any questions about design patterns or computer science, but we should come loaded with all our expertise about issues related to iOS <span>in general.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In other words, expe<a id="_idTextAnchor053" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>ct everything in <span>that interview!</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">What happens in that interview?</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Even though anything <a id="_idIndexMarker100" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>can happen in an iOS technical interview, still, I think we can narrow it down to several options of how it <span>can look.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Notice that interviewers mix some of those options and include them, so we should be prepared for <span>any scenario.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">One of these options is where the interviewer fires questions at us as if we’re on a <span>firing range!</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">The questions range</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">A “questions range” is probably the most common<a id="_idIndexMarker101" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> type of interview because it’s the simplest one. This type is simple for the interviewer and the candidate because there’s nothing easier than just asking short questions with <span>clear answers.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We should think of this type as a driving theory exam – there is a vast pool of questions, and we need to verify that we know almost all <span>their answers.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">But we really need to ensure that we know what is <strong class="bold">behind the answer</strong> and not just memorize it. Because this type of test is very general, we are expected to answer questions we may not know very well and have <span>never encountered.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are a few examples of <span>such questions:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">“What is the UIKit View </em><span><em class="italic">Controller lifecycle?”</em></span></li>
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">“What’s the difference between GCD </em><span><em class="italic">and NSOperationQueue?”</em></span></li>
				<li class="calibre11"><em class="italic">“Can you explain the difference between atomic and </em><span><em class="italic">non-atomic properties?”</em></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">We will discuss interview<a id="_idIndexMarker102" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> questions starting from <a href="B18653_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor097" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, which is another excellent resource for getting us <a id="_idTextAnchor054" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>ready for this part of <span>the process.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor055" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Worked-on projects</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Our expertise is part<a id="_idIndexMarker103" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> of our identity when we start the technical interview. What we know and what we did in our short (or long) working history is something that wraps up our job application. One of our interviewer’s goals is to understand <strong class="bold">how the reality stands up to </strong><span><strong class="bold">our story</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Showing worked-on projects is a way for the interviewer to bridge that gap between our story and who we are. But bridging that gap is not only the interview’s goal – it is ours as well. We want them to see who we <span>really are!</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Therefore, coming ready with projects we worked on in the past is an excellent idea for that kind of interview. Bringing our iPhone loaded with apps we worked on in the past can be significant. But even better, we can come with our MacBook filled with Xcode projects <span>already launched.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">And that leads me to my next point. One of the preparations we need to make before the interview is to go over what we did in the past so that our explanations will be fluent <span>and convincing.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Picking one or two features that we were part of during their development and trying to explain their design while speaking out loud is excellent preparation that will put us in a great position for <span>the interview.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Remember, we don’t need to fake anything. We are great developers, and if we are proud of something we did, we just need t<a id="_idTextAnchor056" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>o show it. Believe me, excitement <span>is contagious.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor057" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Answering Swift and algorithm questions</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Swift is probably the primary<a id="_idIndexMarker104" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> tool that we have as iOS<a id="_idIndexMarker105" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> develo<a id="_idTextAnchor058" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>pers. But when developers say “Swift,” many think of something much broader than just <span>a language.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this case, Swift is much more than “optional unwrapping”. Data structures, closures, and memory management are also part of Swift. And sometimes, Swift is just the infrastructure for something even more significant: design patterns <span>and algorithms.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In the iOS technical interview, questions can go from simple unwrapping up to recursive functions and delegation versus reactive programming debate. This huge spectrum makes this type of interview the most challenging part of the hiring <span>process, professionally.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this book, we will cover<a id="_idIndexMarker106" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> many aspects of Swift relevant<a id="_idIndexMarker107" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> to interviews and explain why each one is important for our daily work and is part of an interview. Remember, Swift and algorithms are just the first floors. We’ve got more floors to the buildings, such as UIKit <span>or SwiftUI.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor059" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Solving basic questions about UIKit and SwiftUI</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Besides Foundation, UIKit and SwiftUI are the only frameworks <a id="_idIndexMarker108" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>that will certainly be part<a id="_idIndexMarker109" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> of a standard interview. The reason is apparent – UI is a major part of almost any iOS project we <a id="_idTextAnchor060" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>will be <span>working on.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">I didn’t just mention “standard interview” and “almost” for no reason. There are cases where UI doesn’t play a major role or even a minor role. For instance, an SDK where we don’t have UI features at all, or games where we have UI but we use SceneKit or Unity instead of UIKit or SwiftUI to <span>build them.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">But for most apps, learning UIKit or SwiftUI at a high level is mandatory. One drawback with many iOS developers today is that they know one framework very well (for example, SwiftUI) and don’t have any experience with the <span>other (UIKit).</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">If that’s the status in our case, we need to gain experience in the other framework and explain that gap during the interview. Even a tiny amount of knowledge shows that we are not disconnected from reality and have a solid capability to fill any gaps in the information we <span>may have.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Remember that many apps make use of both frameworks, so the ability to learn a new framework <span>is crucial.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor061" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Mastering development tools</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">If frameworks are the car<a id="_idIndexMarker110" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> our code rides in, Xcode is the tool we use to build and fix that car. And how can we be great iOS engineers without mastering <span>our tools?</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Mastering Xcode helps iOS developers debug, write more code efficiently, configure the environment and the project, profile the app, and move faster in <span>their job.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">I must admit, asking questions about Xcode is not as common as the other parts I mentioned. Perhaps Xcode is not seen as a core topic or essential. The thing about Xcode questions is that as rare as they are, failing in them is considered a red flag in the interviewer’s eyes. We just can’t afford to fail on a small topic that can devastate <span>our progress.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Xcode is not just the IDE itself but also all the other tools such as the Instruments app, which is mandatory for every iOS developer, UI debugs, <span>and more.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The technical interview tests the theory behind iOS development. Let’s now move to the practical part: the <span>coding interview.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor062" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Cracking the coding interview</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">We know how the world <a id="_idIndexMarker111" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>spins around – some people are great in interviews. They are great at preparing for tests, and they are strong interviewees. We know them from school or college, and they always get good grades. But theory doesn’t necessarily indicate success when it comes to <span>practical tasks.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">That’s why sometimes we have another stage in the process: the <span>coding interview.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The coding interview goal is to see how we handle <strong class="bold">real-life situations</strong> as closely as possible. In these tests, the results are not always what’s critical – the interviewer wants to see how we think, plan, write, and respond to changes <span>and dilemmas.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Even though a coding interview can last 15-20 minutes, it can also be a home assessment that takes one or two days to complete. It sounds like a considerable effort not only from our side but also from the <span>interviewer’s side!</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">That’s why most of the time, the coding interview stage will be after the technical interview. The hiring manager wants to make sure they put that extra effort for candidates who <span>are deserving!</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">There are several ways a workplace can see our coding, which depends on the workplace itself and its culture. The industry is not aligned on what’s considered the best way to test a candidate because there’s a long debate about that. For example, a home assessment allows candidates to complete a coding test at their own pace in a comfortable environment, while a live coding test provides an opportunity for the company to observe the candidate’s problem-solving<a id="_idIndexMarker112" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> and communication skills in <span>real time.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">First, let’s go over the different methods. We’ll start with the live <span>coding interview.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor063" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Live coding interview</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The interviewer<a id="_idIndexMarker113" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> will give us a coding challenge in the live coding<a id="_idIndexMarker114" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> interview. It can be a class, an algorithm question, or even developing a <span>small project.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The primary goal of live coding is to see our coding in action. The interviewer wants to see us write, plan, <span>and think.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">While it may be a stressful <a id="_idIndexMarker115" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>experience for some candidates, there are some things we can take advantage of in this situation, such as <span>the following:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">One advantage is the ability to show <strong class="bold">how we think and deal with ongoing dilemmas</strong> we may have in our tasks. The interviewer expects us to think out loud. Even if we are stuck, good thinking direction can provide us with winning points in the interview. That’s something we just can’t get in a non-live <span>coding task.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre11">The second advantage we may have is the ability to <strong class="bold">ask questions during the exam</strong> that can give us a hint of <span>the solution.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">As we can see, the best approach to a live coding test is to use it as an opportunity to fully showcase one’s knowledge and skills. Another option that takes a different direction is a <span>home assessment.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor064" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Working on a home assessment</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Live coding<a id="_idIndexMarker116" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> has i<a id="_idTextAnchor065" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>ts drawbacks – it’s stressful and time-consuming, which<a id="_idIndexMarker117" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> makes it also time-sensitive. As a result, it covers fewer topics <span>and areas.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">To cover more in the coding test, a standard option is to perform it asynchronously (yeah, just like opening a new background thread in Swift for <span>heavy tasks).</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">A home assessment usefully covers basic subjects in iOS programming – design patterns, architecture, API calls, and some UI with a data source. We shouldn’t expect a complex task – the main goal of home assessment is to see how we handle and approach an entire project, how we separate code and responsibilities to classes and layers, conduct networking and UI, and in general, to see real task results as <span>iOS developers.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Home assessments have clear advantages. They are cheap, as there is no need to spend the interviewer’s time. In fact, time is (almost) a non-factor. On the other hand, some workplaces don’t like home assessments as they don’t test our abilities to solve complex problems in a limited time. Also, home assessments don’t show how we think and face dilemmas during our work. To retrieve that information, the interviewer needs to question and go over the code with us, which makes the advantages I mentioned earlier much <span>less significant.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">But don’t worry! We’ll cover<a id="_idIndexMarker118" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> both live coding and home<a id="_idIndexMarker119" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> assessments in <a href="B18653_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor379" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a><span><em class="italic">.</em></span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Up next, we’ve got the architecture interview for complex <span>architecture problems.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-52" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor066" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Passing the architecture interview</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">The architecture interview<a id="_idIndexMarker120" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> aims to test complex architectural problems. One of its aspects is to see how we plan, approach a problem, and ask relevant questions. Unlike the coding interview, which handles simple or minor problems, the architecture interview requires us to have a broader point of view of how iOS apps are built. That’s one of the reasons why the interviewer will probably be a senior developer, a tech, or a <span>team lead.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The interview covers design patterns, computer science principles, and architecture decisions. This is the interview where we get the chance to shine and show our best as iOS developers. We must lead the discussion, communicate our concerns, and present <span>our thoughts.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We’ve got <a href="B18653_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor329" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a> and <a href="B18653_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor360" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a> covering <strong class="bold">app architecture</strong> and <strong class="bold">design patterns</strong> (we will also discuss the differences between them, <span>don’t worry!).</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In most hiring processes, the architecture interview<a id="_idIndexMarker121" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> is the last stage before we move forward to the HR interview and <span>the offer.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor067" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Throughout this chapter, we’ve learned about the hiring process and its stages. We have dived deep into the screening interview, as it is the first interview in the process. We also discussed the<a id="_idTextAnchor068" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> other interviews – the technical, the coding, and the <span>architectural interview.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The hiring process is much clearer now, isn’t it? But before we get into the interviews themselves, in the next chapter, let’s talk about the missing piece in our career-building process, which is something we all should have: a <span>fantastic brand!</span></p>
