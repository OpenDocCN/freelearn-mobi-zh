It is fast, flexible, free, and App Store approved. More than 2500 App Store games already use it, including many best-selling games. Do you want to take your Cocos2d game development skills to the next level and become more professional in Cocos2d game design?</p><p>Cocos2d for iPhone 1 Game Development Cookbook will help you reach that next level. You will find over 90 recipes here that explain everything from the drawing of a single sprite to AI pathfinding and advanced networking. Full working examples are emphasized.</p><p>Starting with the first chapter,<span class="emphasis"><em> Graphics</em></span>, you will be taken through every major topic of game development. You will find both simple and complex recipes in the book.
</p><p>Each recipe is either a solution to a common problem (playing video files, accelerometer steering) or a cool advanced technique (3D rendering, textured polygons).</p><p>This cookbook will have you creating professional quality iOS games quickly with its breadth of working example code.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Graphics">Chapter 1</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Graphics</em></span>, covers a wide array of topics. It starts by taking a look at the basic uses of sprites. From there it provides examples for 2D and 3D primitive drawing, video playing, particle effects, ease actions, texture filled polygons, palette swapping, lighting, parallaxing, and more.
</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. User Input">Chapter 2</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> User Input</em></span>, provides examples of different styles of input typically used in iOS game development. This includes tapping, holding, dragging, buttons, directional pad, analog stick, accelerometer, pinch zooming, and gestures.
</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Files and Data">Chapter 3</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Files and Data</em></span>, discusses techniques for persisting data. These include PLIST files, JSON files, XML files, NSUserDefaults, archive objects, SQLite, and Core Data.
</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Physics">Chapter 4</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Physics</em></span>, covers a large number of uses of the Box2D physics engine. Examples include debug drawing, collision response, different shapes, dragging, physical properties, impulses, forces, asynchronous body destruction, joints, vehicles, character movement, bullets, ropes, and finally creating a top-down isometric game engine.
</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Scenes and Menus">Chapter 5</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Scenes and Menus</em></span>, provides examples of user interface implementations. It starts with examples involving scene management then moves to typical UI elements like labels, menus, alert dialogs, and UIKit wrapping. From there it moves into more advanced techniques like draggable menu windows, scrolling menus, sliding menus, loading screens, and a minimap.
</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Audio">Chapter 6</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Audio</em></span>, covers a wide range of audio topics which vary in difficulty. These include sounds, music, audio properties, fading audio, in-game examples, positional audio, metering music and dialogue, recording, streaming, playing iPod music, creating a MIDI synthesizer, speech recognition, and text to speech.
</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. AI and Logic">Chapter 7</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> AI and Logic</em></span>, discusses techniques for adding intelligent AI actors into your games. These include processing waypoints, firing projectiles at moving targets, line of sight, and flocking behavior using Boids. The pathfinding problem is tackled in four separate recipes: A* pathfinding in a grid, a Box2D world, a TMX tilemap, and a side-scroller. Finally, the chapter discusses adding Lua scripting support, dynamically loading scripts, and using Lua for dialogue trees.
</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Tips, Tools, and Ports">Chapter 8</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Tips, Tools, and Ports</em></span>, provides example uses of commonly-used tools including the Cocos2d-iPhone testbed, Zwoptex, Tiled, JSONWorldBuilder, and CocosBuilder. It also discusses porting a Cocos2d project to C++ using Cocos2d-X and using Cocos3d to develop a 3D iOS game. Finally, it discusses the process of releasing your app on the Apple App Store.
