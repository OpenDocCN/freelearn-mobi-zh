- en: Kotlin coroutines and flows allow developers to do asynchronous programming
    in Android using simple, modern, and testable code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book focuses on coroutines and flows using hands-on learning. You will
    begin with the basics of asynchronous programming, including an overview of coroutines
    and flows while also integrating them into your Android projects. You’ll understand
    how to manage cancelations and exceptions, and then explore how to test your coroutines
    and flows.

- en: By the end of this book, you will be able to use Kotlin coroutines and flows
    to simplify asynchronous programming in Android.
