			<p>This chapter will introduce you to the Google Play console, release channels, and the entire release process. It covers creating a Google Play Developer account, setting up the store entry for our developed app, and creating a key store (including coverage of the importance of passwords and where to store files). We’ll also learn about app bundles and APK, looking at how to generate the app’s APK or AAB file. Later in the chapter, we’ll set up release paths, open beta, and closed alpha, and finally, we’ll upload our app to the store and download it on <span class="No-Break">a device.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create your own Google Play Developer account, prepare your signed APK or app bundle for publishing, and publish your first application on <span class="No-Break">Google Play.</span><a id="_idTextAnchor925"/></p>
			<p>You learned how to add animations and transitions with <strong class="source inline">CoordinatorLayout</strong> and <strong class="source inline">MotionLayout</strong> in <a href="B19411_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor826"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Animations and Transitions with CoordinatorLayout and MotionLayout</em>. Now, you are ready to develop and launch <span class="No-Break">Android applications.</span></p>
			<p>After developing Android apps, they will only be available on your devices and emulators. You must make them available to everyone so they can download them. In turn, you will acquire users, and you can earn from them. The official marketplace for Android apps is Google Play. With Google Play, the apps and games you release will be available to over two billion active Android devices globally. There are also other marketplaces where you can publish your apps, but they are beyond the scope of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to learn about launching your apps on Google Play. We’ll start with preparing the apps for release and creating a Google Play Developer account. Then, we’ll move on to uploading your app and managing <span class="No-Break">app releases.</span></p>
			<p>We will cover the following topics in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Preparing your apps <span class="No-Break">for release</span></li>
				<li>Creating a <span class="No-Break">developer account</span></li>
				<li>Uploading the app to <span class="No-Break">Google Play</span><a id="_idTextAnchor926"/><a id="_idTextAnchor927"/></li>
				<li>Managing <span class="No-Break">app releases</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-284"><a id="_idTextAnchor928"/>Preparing your apps for release</h1>
			<p>Android Studio <a id="_idIndexMarker1403"/>normally signs your build using a debug key. This debug build<a id="_idIndexMarker1404"/> allows you to build and test your app quickly. To publish your app on Google Play, you must <a id="_idIndexMarker1405"/>create a release build<a id="_idIndexMarker1406"/> signed with your own key. This release build will not be debuggable and can be optimized <span class="No-Break">for size.</span></p>
			<p>The release build must also have the correct version information. Otherwise, you won’t be able to publish a new app or update an already <span class="No-Break">published app.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s start with adding versions to <span class="No-Break">your <a id="_idTextAnchor929"/><a id="_idTextAnchor930"/>app.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-285"><a id="_idTextAnchor931"/>Versioning apps</h2>
			<p>The version of<a id="_idIndexMarker1407"/> your app is<a id="_idIndexMarker1408"/> important for the <span class="No-Break">following reasons:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Users can see the version they have downloaded. They can use this when checking whether there’s an update or whether there are known issues when reporting bugs/problems with <span class="No-Break">the app.</span></li>
				<li>The device and Google Play use the version value to determine whether an app can or should <span class="No-Break">be updated.</span></li>
				<li>Developers can also use this value to add feature support to specific versions. They can also warn or force users to upgrade to the latest version to get important fixes on bugs or <span class="No-Break">security issues.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>An Android app has two versions: <strong class="source inline">versionCode</strong> and <strong class="source inline">versionName</strong>. Now, <strong class="source inline">versionCode</strong> is an integer that is used by developers, Google Play, and the Android system while <strong class="source inline">versionName</strong> is the string that the users see on the Google Play page for <span class="No-Break">your app.</span></p>
			<p>The initial release of an app should have a <strong class="source inline">versionCode</strong> value of <strong class="source inline">1</strong>, and you should increase it for each <span class="No-Break">new release.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source inline">versionName</strong> can be in <em class="italic">x.y</em> format (where <em class="italic">x</em> is the major version, and <em class="italic">y</em> is the minor version). You can also use semantic versioning, as in <em class="italic">x.y.z</em>, by adding the patch version <span class="No-Break">with </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">z</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>To learn more about <a id="_idIndexMarker1409"/>semantic versioning, refer <span class="No-Break">to </span><a href="https://semver.org"><span class="No-Break">https://semver.org</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker1410"/>module’s <strong class="source inline">build.gradle</strong> files, <strong class="source inline">versionCode</strong> and <strong class="source inline">versionName</strong> are automatically <a id="_idIndexMarker1411"/>generated when you create a new project in Android Studio. They are in the <strong class="source inline">defaultConfig</strong> block under the <strong class="source inline">android</strong> block. An example <strong class="source inline">build.gradle</strong> file shows <span class="No-Break">these values:</span></p>
			<pre class="source code">
android {
    compileSdk 33
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.app"
        minSdk 21
        targetSdk 33
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
        ...
    }
    ...
}</pre>
			<p>When publishing updates, the new package being released must have a higher <strong class="source inline">versionCode</strong> value because users cannot downgrade their apps and can only download <span class="No-Break">new versions.</span></p>
			<p>After ensuring that the <a id="_idIndexMarker1412"/>app version is correct, the next step in the release process is to<a id="_idIndexMarker1413"/> get a keystore to sign the app. This will be discussed in the <span class="No-Break">ne<a id="_idTextAnchor932"/><a id="_idTextAnchor933"/>xt section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-286"><a id="_idTextAnchor934"/>Creating a keystore</h2>
			<p>Android apps, when run, are automatically<a id="_idIndexMarker1414"/> signed by a debug key. However, before it can be published on Google Play Store, an app must be signed with a release key. To do so, you must have a keystore. If you don’t have one yet, you can create one in <span class="No-Break">And<a id="_idTextAnchor935"/><a id="_idTextAnchor936"/>roid Studio.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-287"><a id="_idTextAnchor937"/>Exercise 17.01 – creating a keystore in Android Studio</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we’ll use <a id="_idIndexMarker1415"/>Android Studio to make a keystore that can <a id="_idIndexMarker1416"/>be used to sign Android apps. Follow these steps to complete <span class="No-Break">this exercise:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open a project in <span class="No-Break">Android Studio.</span></li>
				<li>Go to the <strong class="bold">Build</strong> menu and then click on <strong class="bold">Generate Signed <a id="_idTextAnchor938"/>Bundle </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">or APK</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></li>

			<p>An <strong class="bold">APK</strong> file<a id="_idIndexMarker1417"/> is the file format by which users can install your app. The Android App Bundle<a id="_idIndexMarker1418"/> is a new file publishing format that allows Google Play to distribute specific and smaller APKs to devices, so developers don’t need to release and manage multiple APKs to support <span class="No-Break">different devices.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Make <a id="_idIndexMarker1419"/>sure either <strong class="bold">APK</strong> or <strong class="bold">Android App Bundle</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker1420"/> selected, and then click the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button.

			<ol>
				<li value="5">In the <strong class="bold">Key store path</strong> field, choose the location where the keystore file will be saved. You can <a id="_idIndexMarker1421"/>click on the folder icon on the right to<a id="_idIndexMarker1422"/> select your folder and type the filename. The value will be similar <span class="No-Break">to </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source inline">users/packt/downloads/keystore.keystore</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Provide the password in both the <strong class="bold">Password</strong> and <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Confirm</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> fields.</span></li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Certificate</strong> section under <strong class="bold">Key</strong>, input values into the <strong class="bold">First and Last Name</strong>, <strong class="bold">Organizational Unit</strong>, <strong class="bold">Organization</strong>, <strong class="bold">City or Locality</strong>, <strong class="bold">State or Province</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Country Code</strong> fields. Only one of these is required, but it’s good to provide all <span class="No-Break">the information.</span></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">OK</strong> button. If there is no error, the keystore will be created in the path you provided, and you will be back in the <strong class="bold">Generate Signed Bundle or APK</strong> dialog with the keystore values so you can continue generating the APK or app bundle. You could close the dialog if you only wanted to create <span class="No-Break">a keystore.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, you have created your own keystore, which you can use to sign applications to be published to <span class="No-Break">Google Play.</span></p>
			<p>You can also use the<a id="_idIndexMarker1423"/> command line to generate a keystore if you prefer to use that. The <strong class="source inline">keytool</strong> command<a id="_idIndexMarker1424"/> is <a id="_idIndexMarker1425"/>available in the <strong class="bold">Java Development Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">JDK</strong>). The <a id="_idIndexMarker1426"/>command is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source code">
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-key.jks -keyalg RSA –
keysize
  2048 -validity 9125 -alias key-alias</pre>
			<p>This command creates a 2,048-bit RSA keystore in the current working directory, valid for 9,125 days (25 years), with a <strong class="source inline">my-key.jks</strong> filename and an <strong class="source inline">key-alias</strong> alias. You can change the validity, filename, and alias to your preferred values. The command line will prompt you to input the keystore password, then prompt you to enter it again <span class="No-Break">to confirm.</span></p>
			<p>It will then ask you for the first and last name, organizational unit, organization name, city or locality, state or province, and country code, one at a time. Only one of these is required; you can press the <em class="italic">Enter</em> key if you want to leave something blank. It is good practice, though, to provide all <span class="No-Break">the information.</span></p>
			<p>After the country code prompt, you will be asked to verify the input provided. You can type <strong class="source inline">yes</strong> to confirm. You will then be asked to provide the password for the key alias. If you want it to be the<a id="_idIndexMarker1427"/> same as the keystore password, you can press <em class="italic">Enter</em>. The<a id="_idIndexMarker1428"/> keystore will then <span class="No-Break">be generated.</span></p>
			<p>Now that you have a keystore for signing your apps, you need to know how you can keep it safe. You’ll learn about th<a id="_idTextAnchor941"/>at i<a id="_idTextAnchor942"/>n the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-288"><a id="_idTextAnchor943"/>Storing the keystore and passwords</h2>
			<p>You need to keep the<a id="_idIndexMarker1429"/> keystore and passwords in a safe and secure place because if you<a id="_idIndexMarker1430"/> lose the keystore and/or its credentials, you will no longer be able to release updates for your apps. If a hacker also gains access to these, they may be able to update your apps without <span class="No-Break">your consent.</span></p>
			<p>You can store the keystore in your CI/build server or on a <span class="No-Break">secure server.</span></p>
			<p>Keeping the credentials is a bit tricky, as you will need them later when signing releases for app updates. One way you can do this is by including this information in your project’s <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source inline">app/build.gradle</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> file.</span></p>
			<p>In the <strong class="source inline">android</strong> block, you can have <strong class="source inline">signingConfigs</strong>, which references the keystore file, its<a id="_idIndexMarker1431"/> password, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1432"/>the key’s alias <span class="No-Break">and password:</span></p>
			<pre class="source code">
android {
    ...
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file("keystore-file")
            storePassword "keystore-password"
            keyAlias "key-alias"
            keyPassword "key-password"
        }
    }
    ...
}</pre>
			<p>Under the <strong class="source inline">buildTypes</strong> release block in the project’s <strong class="source inline">build.gradle</strong> file, you can specify the release config in the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source inline">signingConfigs</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> block:</span></p>
			<pre class="source code">
buildTypes {
        release {
            ...
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
        ...
}</pre>
			<p>Storing the signing configs in the <strong class="source inline">build.gradle</strong> file is not that secure, as someone who has access to the project or the repository can compromise <span class="No-Break">the app.</span></p>
			<p>You <a id="_idIndexMarker1433"/>can store these credentials in environment variables to make <a id="_idIndexMarker1434"/>them more secure. With this approach, even if malicious people get access to your code, the app updates will still be safe as the signing configurations are not stored in your code but on the system. An environment variable is a key-value pair that is set outside <a id="_idIndexMarker1435"/>your <strong class="bold">integrated development environment </strong>(<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) or project, for example, on your own computer or on a <span class="No-Break">build server.</span></p>
			<p>To use environment variables for keystore configurations in Gradle, you can create environment variables for the store file path, store password, key alias, and key password. For example, you can use the <strong class="source inline">KEYSTORE_FILE</strong>, <strong class="source inline">KEYSTORE_PASSWORD</strong>, <strong class="source inline">KEY_ALIAS</strong>, and <strong class="source inline">KEY_PASSWORD</strong> <span class="No-Break">environment variables.</span></p>
			<p>On macOS and Linux, you can set an environment variable by using the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span></p>
			<pre class="source code">
export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=securepassword</pre>
			<p>If you’re using Windows, it can be done with <span class="No-Break">this command:</span></p>
			<pre class="source code">
set KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=securepassword</pre>
			<p>This command will create a <strong class="source inline">KEYSTORE_PASSWORD</strong> environment variable with <strong class="source inline">securepassword</strong> as the value. In the <strong class="source inline">app/build.gradle</strong> file, you can then use the values from the <span class="No-Break">environment variables:</span></p>
			<pre class="source code">
storeFile System.getenv("KEYSTORE_FILE")
storePassword System.getenv("KEYSTORE_PASSWORD")
keyAlias System.getenv("KEY_ALIAS")
keyPassword System.getenv("KEY_PASSWORD")</pre>
			<p>Your <a id="_idIndexMarker1436"/>keystore will <a id="_idIndexMarker1437"/>be used to sign your app for release so you can publish it on Google Play. We’ll discuss that in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-289"><a id="_idTextAnchor944"/>Signing your apps for release</h2>
			<p>When you run an<a id="_idIndexMarker1438"/> application on an emulator or an actual device, Android <a id="_idIndexMarker1439"/>Studio automatically signs it with the debug keystore. To publish it on Google Play, you must sign the APK or app bundle with your own key, using a keystore you made in Android Studio or from the <span class="No-Break">command line.</span></p>
			<p>Suppose you have added the signing config for the release build in your <strong class="source inline">build.gradle</strong> file; you can automatically build a signed APK or app bundle by selecting the release build in the <strong class="bold">Build Variants</strong> window. You then need to go to the <strong class="bold">Build</strong> menu, click on the <strong class="bold">Build Bundle(s)</strong> item, and then select either <strong class="bold">Build APK(s)</strong> or <strong class="bold">Build Bundle(s)</strong>. The APK or app bundle will be generated in the <strong class="source inline">app/build<a id="_idTextAnchor945"/>/out<a id="_idTextAnchor946"/>put</strong> directory of <span class="No-Break">your project.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-290"><a id="_idTextAnchor947"/>Exercise 17.02 – creating a signed APK</h2>

			<p>In this exercise, you have made a signed APK, which you can now publish on Google Play. In the next section, you will learn about Android App Bundle, which is a new <a id="_idTextAnchor951"/>way of p<a id="_idTextAnchor952"/>ackaging apps <span class="No-Break">for release.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-291"><a id="_idTextAnchor953"/>Android app bundle</h2>
			<p>The traditional way of releasing <a id="_idIndexMarker1444"/>Android apps is through an APK or an application package. This APK file is the one downloaded to users’ devices when they install your app. This one big file contains all the strings, images, and other resources for all <span class="No-Break">device configurations.</span></p>
			<p>As you support more device types and more countries, this APK file will grow in size. The APK that users download will contain things that are not really needed for their devices. This will be an issue for you as users with low storage might not have enough space to install your app. Users with expensive data plans or slow internet connections might also avoid downloading the app if it’s too big. They might also uninstall your app to save <span class="No-Break">storage space.</span></p>
			<p>Some developers have built an published multiple APKs to avoid these issues. However, it’s a complicated and inefficient solution, especially when you target different screen densities, CPU architectures, and languages. In addition, that would be too many APK files to maintain <span class="No-Break">per release.</span></p>
			<p>Android App Bundle is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1445"/>new way of packaging apps for publishing. You just generate a single app bundle file (using Android Studio 3.2 and upward) and upload it on Google Play. Google Play will automatically generate the base APK file and the APK files for each device configuration, CPU architecture, and language. Users who install your app will only download the necessary APKs for their device. This will be smaller in size compared to a <span class="No-Break">universal APK.</span></p>
			<p>This will work for devices running on Android 5.0 Lollipop and upward; for those below it, the APK files that will be generated are only for device configuration and CPU architecture. All the languages and other resource<a id="_idTextAnchor954"/>s will b<a id="_idTextAnchor955"/>e included in each <span class="No-Break">APK file.</span></p>

			<p>In this exercise, you<a id="_idIndexMarker1449"/> have made a signed app bundle that you can now publish on <span class="No-Break">Google Play.</span></p>
			<p>To be able to publish your app to Google Play Store with the Android app bundle format, you will first need to opt-in to Google Play’s app signing feature. We will discuss Google P<a id="_idTextAnchor961"/>lay app signing in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-293"><a id="_idTextAnchor962"/>App signing by Google Play</h2>
			<p>Google Play provides<a id="_idIndexMarker1450"/> a service called app signing<a id="_idIndexMarker1451"/> that allows Google to manage and protect your app signing keys and automatically re-sign your app <span class="No-Break">for users.</span></p>
			<p>With the Google Play app signing service, you can let Google generate the signing key or upload your own. You can also create a different upload key for additional security. You can sign the app with the upload key and publish the app on the <span class="No-Break">Play Console.</span></p>
			<p>Google will check the upload key, remove it, and use the app signing key to re-sign the app for distribution to users. When app signing is enabled for the app, the upload key can be reset. If you lose the upload key or feel that it is already compromised, you can simply contact Google Play developer support, verify your identity, and get a new <span class="No-Break">upload key.</span></p>
			<p>It is easy to opt into app signing when publishing a new app. In the Google Play Console (<a href="https://play.google.com/console">https://play.google.com/console</a>), you can go to the <strong class="bold">Release Management</strong> | <strong class="bold">App Releases</strong> section and select <strong class="bold">Continue</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Let Google manage and protect your app signing key</strong> section. The key you originally used to sign the app will become the upload key, and Google Play will generate a new app <span class="No-Break">signing key.</span></p>
			<p>You can also configure existing apps to use app signing. This is available in the <strong class="bold">Release</strong> | <strong class="bold">Setup</strong> | <strong class="bold">App Signing</strong> section of the app in the Google Play Console. You need to upload your existing app signing key and generate a new <span class="No-Break">upload key.</span></p>
			<p>Once you enroll in Google Play app signing, you can no longer opt out. Also, if you use third-party services, you must use the app signing key’s certificate. This is available in <strong class="bold">Release Management</strong> | <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">App Signing</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>App signing<a id="_idIndexMarker1452"/> also enables you to upload an app bundle, and Google <a id="_idIndexMarker1453"/>Play will automatically sign and generate APK files, which users will download when they install <span class="No-Break">your app.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, you will create a Google Play developer account, so you can publish an app’s <a id="_idTextAnchor963"/>signed APK o<a id="_idTextAnchor964"/>r app bundle to <span class="No-Break">Google Play.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-294"><a id="_idTextAnchor965"/>Creating a developer account</h1>
			<p>To publish applications on<a id="_idIndexMarker1454"/> Google Play, the first step that you need to take is to create a Google Play developer account. Head over to <a href="https://play.google.com/console/signup">https://play.google.com/console/signup</a> and log in with your Google account. If you don’t have one, you should create <span class="No-Break">one first.</span></p>
			<p>We recommend using a Google account that you plan to use in the long term instead of a throwaway one. Read the developer distribution agreement and agree to the terms <span class="No-Break">of service.</span></p>
			<p class="callout heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If your goal is to sell paid apps or add in-app products to your apps/games, you must also create a merchant account. This is not available in all countries, unfortunately. We won’t cover this here, but you can read more about it on the registration page or <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://packt.link/LDncA"><span class="No-Break">https://packt.link/LDncA</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>You must pay a $25 registration fee to create your Google Play Developer account. (This is a one-time payment). The fee must be paid using a valid debit/credit card, but some prepaid/virtual credit cards also work. What you can use varies <span class="No-Break">by location/country.</span></p>
			<p>The final step is to complete the account details, such as the developer’s name, email address, website, and phone number. These, which can be updated later, will form the developer information displayed on your app’s <span class="No-Break">store listing.</span></p>
			<p>After completing the registration, you will receive a confirmation email. It may take a few hours (up to 48 hours) for your payment to be processed and your account registered, so be patient. Ideally, you should do this in advance, even if your app is not yet ready, so you can easily publish the app once it’s ready <span class="No-Break">for release.</span></p>
			<p>When you have <a id="_idIndexMarker1455"/>received the confirmation email from Google, you can start publishing apps and games to <span class="No-Break">Google Play.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, we w<a id="_idTextAnchor966"/>ill discuss <a id="_idTextAnchor967"/>uploading apps to <span class="No-Break">Google Play.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-295"><a id="_idTextAnchor968"/>Uploading an app to Google Play</h1>
			<p>Once <a id="_idIndexMarker1456"/>you have an app ready for release and a Google<a id="_idIndexMarker1457"/> Play Developer account, you can go to the Google Play Console (<a href="https://play.google.com/console">https://play.google.com/console</a>) to publish <span class="No-Break">the app.</span></p>
			<p>To upload an app, go to the Play Console, click <strong class="bold">All Apps</strong>, and then click <strong class="bold">Create app</strong>. Provide the name of the application and the default language. In the <strong class="bold">App or game</strong> section, set whether it’s an app or game. Likewise, in the <strong class="bold">Free or paid</strong> section, set whether it’s free or paid. Create your store listing, prepare the app release, and roll out the release. We’ll have a<a id="_idTextAnchor969"/> look at the<a id="_idTextAnchor970"/> detailed steps in <span class="No-Break">this section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor971"/>Creating a store listing</h2>
			<p>The store listing is what<a id="_idIndexMarker1458"/> users first see when they open your app’s page on Google Play. If the app is already published, you can go to <strong class="bold">Grow</strong>, <strong class="bold">S<a id="_idTextAnchor972"/>tore presence</strong>, and select <strong class="bold">Main </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">store listing</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>App Details</h3>
			<p>You will navigate to <a id="_idIndexMarker1459"/>the <strong class="bold">App details</strong> page. On the <strong class="bold">App details</strong> page, you need to fill in the <span class="No-Break">following fields:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">App name</strong>: Here, you provide your app’s name (the maximum number of characters <span class="No-Break">is 50).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Short description</strong>: Here, you provide a short text summarizing your app (the maximum number of characters <span class="No-Break">is 80).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Full description</strong>: This is the long description for your app. The limit is 4,000 characters, so you can add a lot of relevant information here, such as what its features are and things <a id="_idIndexMarker1460"/>users need <span class="No-Break">to know.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">For the product details, you can add localized versions depending on the languages/countries where your app will <span class="No-Break">be released.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Your app title and description must not contain copyrighted materials and spam, a<a id="_idTextAnchor973"/><a id="_idTextAnchor974"/>s this might result in your app <span class="No-Break">being rejected.</span></p>
			<h3>Graphic Assets</h3>
			<p>In this section, provide the<a id="_idIndexMarker1461"/> <span class="No-Break">following details:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>An icon (a high-resolution icon that is 512 <span class="No-Break">x 512).</span></li>
				<li>A feature graphic (1,024 <span class="No-Break">x 500).</span></li>
				<li>2–8 screenshots of the app. If your app supports other form factors (tablet, TV, or Wear OS), you should also add screenshots for each <span class="No-Break">form factor.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can also add promo graphics and videos if you have any. Your app can be rejected if you use graphics that violate Google Play policy, so ensure that the images you use are your own and don<a id="_idTextAnchor975"/>’t include c<a id="_idTextAnchor976"/>opyrighted or <span class="No-Break">inappropriate content.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor977"/>Preparing the release</h2>
			<p>Before preparing your<a id="_idIndexMarker1462"/> release, ensure that your build is signed with a signature key. If you’re publishing an app update, make sure that it is of the same package name, signed with the same key, and with a version code higher than the current one on the <span class="No-Break">Play Store.</span></p>
			<p>You must also make sure you follow the developer policy (to avoid any violations) and make sure that your app follows the app quality guidelines. More of these are listed on the launch checklist, which<a id="_idIndexMarker1463"/> you can see <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/"><span class="No-Break">https:/<span id="_idTextAnchor978"/><span id="_idTextAnchor979"/>/support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>APK/app bundle</h3>
			<p>You can upload an APK or<a id="_idIndexMarker1464"/> the newer format: Android App Bundle. Go to <strong class="bold">Release</strong> and then <strong class="bold">App Releases</strong>. This will display a summary of active and draft releases in <span class="No-Break">each track.</span></p>
			<p>There are different tracks where you can release <span class="No-Break">the app:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Production</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Open testing</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Closed testing</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Internal testing</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We’ll discuss the release tracks in detail in this chapter’s <em class="italic">Managing app </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">releases</em></span><span class="No-Break"> section.</span></p>
			<p>Select the track where you will create the release. For the production track, you can select <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> on the left. For the other tracks, click <strong class="bold">Testing</strong> first, and then select the track. To release on a closed testing track, you must also select <strong class="bold">Manage track</strong> and then create a new track by clicking on <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Create track</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Once done, you can click <strong class="bold">Create new release</strong> at the top right of the page. In the <strong class="bold">Android App Bundles and APKs to add</strong> section, you can upload your APK or <span class="No-Break">app bundle.</span></p>
			<p>Make sure that the app bundle or APK file is signed by your release signing key. The Google Play Console will not accept it if it’s not properly signed. If you’re publishing an update, the version code for the app bundle or APK must be higher than the <span class="No-Break">existing version.</span></p>
			<p>You can also add a release name and release notes. The release name is for the developer’s use to track the release and won’t be visible to users. By default, the version name of the APK or app bundle uploaded is set as the release name. The release notes form the text that will be shown on the Play page and will inform users of what the updates to the <span class="No-Break">app are.</span></p>
			<p>The text for the release notes must be added inside the tags for the language. For example, the opening and closing tags for the default US English language are <strong class="source inline">&lt;en-US&gt;</strong> and <strong class="source inline">&lt;/en-US&gt;</strong>. If your app supports multiple languages, each language tag will be displayed in the field for the release notes by default. You can then add the release notes for <span class="No-Break">each language.</span></p>
			<p>If you have already released the app, you can copy the release notes from previous releases and reuse or modify them by clicking the <strong class="bold">Copy from a previous release</strong> button and selecting from <span class="No-Break">the list.</span></p>
			<p>When you click the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button, the<a id="_idIndexMarker1465"/> release will be saved, and you can go back to it later. The <strong class="bold">Review release</strong> button will take you to the s<a id="_idTextAnchor980"/>creen where you can review and roll out <span class="No-Break">the release.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-298"><a id="_idTextAnchor981"/>Rolling out a release</h2>
			<p>If you’re ready to roll out your <a id="_idIndexMarker1466"/>release, go to the Play Console and select your app. Go to <strong class="bold">Release</strong> and select your release track. Click the <strong class="bold">Releases</strong> tab a<a id="_idTextAnchor982"/>nd then click on the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> button next to <span class="No-Break">the release:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer257" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 17.12 – A draft release on the Production track</p>
			<p>You can review the <a id="_idIndexMarker1467"/>APK or app bundle, release names, and release notes. Click the <strong class="bold">Review release</strong> button to start the rollout for the release. The Play Console will open the <strong class="bold">Review and release</strong> screen. Here, you can review the release information and check whether there are warnings <span class="No-Break">or errors.</span></p>
			<p>If you are updating an app, you can also select the rollout percentage when creating another release. Setting it to 100% means it will be available for all your users to download. When you set it to a lower percentage, for example, 50%, the release will be available to half of your <span class="No-Break">existing users.</span></p>
			<p>If you’re confident with the release, select the <strong class="bold">START ROLLOUT TO PRODUCTION</strong> button at the bottom of the page. After publishing your app, it will take a while (7 days or longer for new apps) before it is reviewed. You can see the status in the top-right corner of the Google Play Console. These statuses include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Pending publication</strong> (your new app is <span class="No-Break">being reviewed)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Published</strong> (your app is now available on <span class="No-Break">Google Play)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rejected</strong> (your app wasn’t published because of a <span class="No-Break">policy violation)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Suspended</strong> (your app violated Google Play policy and <span class="No-Break">was suspended)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If there are issues with your app, you can resolve them and resubmit the app. Your app can be rejected for reasons such as copyright infringement, impersonation, <span class="No-Break">and spam.</span></p>
			<p>Once the app has<a id="_idIndexMarker1468"/> been published, users can now download it. It can take some time before the new app or the app update becomes live on Google Play. If you’re trying to search for your app on Google Play, it might not be searchable. Mak<a id="_idTextAnchor983"/><a id="_idTextAnchor984"/>e sure you publish it on the production or <span class="No-Break">open track.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor985"/>Managing app releases</h1>
			<p>You can slowly release your <a id="_idIndexMarker1469"/>apps on different tracks to test them before publicly rolling them out to users. You can also do timed publishing to make the app available on a certain date instead <a id="_idTextAnchor986"/>of automatically publishing it once approved <span class="No-Break">by Google.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor987"/>Release tracks</h2>
			<p>When creating a release <a id="_idIndexMarker1470"/>for an app, you can choose between four <span class="No-Break">different tracks:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Production is where everyone can see <span class="No-Break">the app.</span></li>
				<li>Open testing is targeted at wider public testing. The release will be available on Google Play, and anyone can join the beta program <span class="No-Break">and test.</span></li>
				<li>Closed testing is intended for small groups of users testing <span class="No-Break">pre-release versions.</span></li>
				<li>Internal testing is for the developer/tester builds while developing/testing <span class="No-Break">an app.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The internal, closed, and open tracks allow developers to create a special release and allow real users to download it while the rest are on the production version. This allows you to know whether the release has bugs and quickly fix them before rolling it out to everyone. User feedback on these tracks will also not affect the public reviews/ratings of <span class="No-Break">your app.</span></p>
			<p>The ideal way is to release it first on internal tracks during development and internal testing. When a pre-release version is ready, you can create a closed test for a small group of trusted people/users/testers. Then, you can create an open test to allow other users to try your app before the full launch <span class="No-Break">to production.</span></p>
			<p>To go to each track<a id="_idIndexMarker1471"/> and manage releases, you can go to the <strong class="bold">Release</strong> section of the Google Play Console and select <strong class="bold">Production</strong> <a id="_idTextAnchor988"/><a id="_idTextAnchor989"/>or <strong class="bold">Testing</strong> and then the <strong class="bold">Open testing</strong>, <strong class="bold">Closed testing</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Internal </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">testing</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> tracks.</span></p>
			<h3>The feedback channel and opt-in link</h3>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker1472"/> internal, closed, and open tracks, there is a section for <strong class="bold">Feedback URL or email address</strong> and <strong class="bold">How testers join your test</strong>. You can provide an email address or a <a id="_idIndexMarker1473"/>website under <strong class="bold">Feedback URL or email address</strong> to which testers can send their feedback. This is displayed when they opt into your <span class="No-Break">testing program.</span></p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">How testers join your test</strong> section, you can copy the link to share with your teste<a id="_idTextAnchor990"/><a id="_idTextAnchor991"/>rs. They can then join the testing program using <span class="No-Break">this link.</span></p>
			<h3>Internal testing</h3>
			<p>This track is for builds while <a id="_idIndexMarker1474"/>developing/testing the app. Releases here will be quickly available on Google Play for internal testers. In the <strong class="bold">Testers</strong> tab, there’s a <strong class="bold">Testers</strong> section. You can choose an existing list or create a new <a id="_idTextAnchor992"/><a id="_idTextAnchor993"/>one. There is a maximum of 100 testers for an <span class="No-Break">internal test.</span></p>
			<h3>Closed testing</h3>
			<p>On the <strong class="bold">Testers</strong> tab, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker1475"/> choose <strong class="bold">Email list</strong> or <strong class="bold">Google Groups</strong> for the testers. If you choose email lists, choose a list of testers or create a new list. There is a maximum of 2,000 testers for a <span class="No-Break">closed test.</span></p>
			<p>If you select <strong class="bold">Google Groups</strong>, you can provide the Google Group email address (for example, <strong class="source inline">the-alpha-group@googlegroups<a id="_idTextAnchor994"/><a id="_idTextAnchor995"/><a id="_idTextAnchor996"/>.com</strong>), and all the members of that group will <span class="No-Break">become testers.</span></p>
			<h3>Open testing</h3>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Testers</strong> tab, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker1476"/>set <strong class="bold">Unlimited</strong> or <strong class="bold">Limited number</strong> for the testers. The minimum number of testers for the limited testing that you can set <span class="No-Break">is 1,000.</span></p>
			<p>In the open, closed, and internal tracks, you can add users to be your testers for your applic<a id="_idTextAnchor997"/>ations. You will learn how to add testers in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor998"/>Staged rollouts</h2>
			<p>When rolling out app <a id="_idIndexMarker1477"/>updates, you can release them to a small group of users first. Then, when the release has issues, you can stop the rollout or publish another update to fix the issues. If there are none, you can slowly increase the rollout percentage. This is called <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">staged rollout</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>If you have published an update to less than 100% of your users, you can go to the Play Console, select <strong class="bold">Release</strong>, click the track, then select the <strong class="bold">Releases</strong> tab. Below the release you want to update, you can see the <strong class="bold">Manage rollout</strong> drop-down menu. It will have options to update or halt <span class="No-Break">the rollout.</span></p>
			<p>You can select <strong class="bold">Manage rollout</strong>, then <strong class="bold">Update rollout</strong> to increase the percentage of the rollout of the release. A dialog will appear where you can input the rollout percentage. You can also click the <strong class="bold">Update</strong> button to update <span class="No-Break">the percentage.</span></p>
			<p>A 100% rollout will make the release available to all of your users. Any percentage below that means the release will only be available to that percentage of <span class="No-Break">your users.</span></p>
			<p>If a major bug or crash is found during a staged rollout, you can go to the Play Console, select <strong class="bold">Release</strong>, click the track, then select the <strong class="bold">Releases</strong> tab. Under the release you want to update, select <strong class="bold">Manage rollout</strong>, then <strong class="bold">Halt rollout</strong>. A dialog will appear with additional information. Add a<a id="_idTextAnchor999"/>n optional note, then click the <strong class="bold">Halt rollout</strong> button <span class="No-Break">to confirm:</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor1007"/>Activity 17.01 – publishing an app</h2>
			<p>As the final activity of this book, you<a id="_idIndexMarker1480"/> are tasked with creating a Google Play Developer account and publishing a newly developed Android app that you have built. You could publish one of the apps you’ve built as part of this book or another project that you’ve developed. You can use the following steps <span class="No-Break">as guidelines:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the Google Play Developer Console (<a href="https://play.google.com/console">https://play.google.com/console</a>) and create <span class="No-Break">an account.</span></li>
				<li>Create a keystore that you can use for signing the <span class="No-Break">release build.</span></li>
				<li>Generate an Android app bundle <span class="No-Break">for release.</span></li>
				<li>Publish the app on an open beta track before releasing it to the <span class="No-Break">production track.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The detailed steps for publishing an app have been explained throughout this chapter, so no separate solution is available for this activity. You can follow the exercises of this chapter to successfully complete the preceding steps. The exact steps required will be uniqu<a id="_idTextAnchor1008"/><a id="_idTextAnchor1009"/>e to your app and<a id="_idTextAnchor1010"/> will depend on the settings you want <span class="No-Break">to use.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor1011"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter covered the Google Play Store: from preparing a release to creating a Google Play Developer account and finally publishing your app. We started with versioning your apps, generating a keystore, creating an APK file or Android app bundle and signing it with a release keystore, and storing the keystore and its credentials. We then moved on to registering an account on the Google Play Console, uploading your APK file or app bundle, and <span class="No-Break">managing releases.</span></p>
			<p>This is the culmination of the work done throughout this book—publishing your app and opening it up to the world is a great achievement and demonstrates your progress throughout <span class="No-Break">this course.</span></p>
			<p>Throughout this book, you have gained many skills, from the basics of Android app development and building up to implementing features such as RecyclerViews, fetching data from web services, notifications, and testing. You have seen how to improve your apps with best practices, architecture patterns, and animations, and finally, you have learned how to publish them to <span class="No-Break">Google Play.</span></p>
			<p>This is still just the start of your journey as an Android developer. There are many more advanced skills for you to develop as you continue to build more complex apps of your own and expand upon what you have <span class="No-Break">learned here.</span></p>
			<p>Remember that Android is continuously evolving, so keep yourself up to date with the latest Android releases. You can go to <a href="https://developer.android.com/">https://developer.android.com/</a> to find the latest resources and further immerse yourself in the <span class="No-Break">Android world.</span></p>
