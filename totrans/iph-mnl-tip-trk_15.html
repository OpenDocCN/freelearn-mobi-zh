		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-249"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor544"/>Chapter 15</em>: Writing Notes and Recording Voice Memos</h1>
			<p>When you're away from your desk, it's easy to get a sudden inspiration and need to capture your idea. Far too often, people forget their ideas completely. Other times, you may need to jot your ideas down on any scrap of paper you can find, such as a paper napkin or the back of an envelope. Ideally, you should carry a notepad and pen or pencil at all times since you never know when a good idea might hit you and you'll need to write it down.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, with your iPhone, you'll always have a way to record your ideas at any time in one of two ways. First, you can type ideas using the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app, which acts like a simple word processor for capturing small amounts of text. Second, you can dictate your ideas to the Voice Memos app so you can capture an audio file of your spoken thoughts.</p>
			<p>No matter where inspiration strikes you, you'll be able to record your thoughts as written text or spoken audio by using your iPhone. Now you just have to remember to keep your iPhone with you at all times.</p>
			<p>The topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating notes and editing text</li>
				<li>Adding pictures and drawings to notes</li>
				<li>Recording voice memos</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor545"/><a id="_idTextAnchor546"/><a id="_idTextAnchor547"/><a id="_idTextAnchor548"/>Taking notes</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app mimics<a id="_idIndexMarker849"/> a paper notepad. While a paper notepad has a limited number of pages and each page has<a id="_idIndexMarker850"/> a limited amount of space, the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app lets you create an unlimited number of pages of unlimited size. </p>
			<p>Once you capture your ideas in the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app, you can share them with others or simply copy and paste text from the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app into another app, such as the Pages word processor.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor549"/>Understanding folders</h2>
			<p>To help you keep your notes<a id="_idIndexMarker851"/> organized, the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app can store them in folders, much like folders on a computer. The idea is to create separate folders for storing<a id="_idIndexMarker852"/> related notes, such as a folder for work projects and another folder for personal information. By creating and using folders, you can better organize your notes to help you find them again.</p>
			<p>To see how to create a folder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes app</strong> on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the Back button in the upper-left corner of the screen until the <strong class="bold">Folders</strong> screen appears. The <strong class="bold">Folders</strong> screen shows the location of notes in both the iCloud (at the top) and your iPhone, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.1<a id="_idTextAnchor550"/><a id="_idTextAnchor551"/></em>: <div><img alt="Figure 15.1 – The Folders screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.1 – The Folders screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">New Folder</strong> in the<a id="_idIndexMarker853"/> bottom-left corner of the screen. A <strong class="bold">New Folder</strong> dialog appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.2</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.2 – The New Folder screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.2 – The New Folder screen</p></li>
				<li>Type a descriptive<a id="_idIndexMarker854"/> name for your folder and tap <strong class="bold">Save</strong>. Your new folder appears under the <strong class="bold">On My iPhone</strong> category.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you have created a folder, you <a id="_idIndexMarker855"/>can store notes in that folder. To delete a folder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the Back button in the upper-left corner of the screen until the <strong class="bold">Folders</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Swipe left on that folder and tap the Delete icon that appears on the right. A dialog appears, asking you to verify that you want to delete a folder with any notes and subfolders inside.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">OK</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After you delete a folder, the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app stores the deleted folder in a special <strong class="bold">Recently Deleted</strong> folder that will give you 30 days to retrieve your notes before your iPhone erases them for good.</p>
			<p>To retrieve a folder from the <strong class="bold">Recently Deleted</strong> folder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the Back button in the upper-left corner of the screen until the <strong class="bold">Folders</strong> screen appears. The <strong class="bold">Recently Deleted</strong> folder <a id="_idIndexMarker856"/>appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.3</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.3 – The Recently Deleted folder appears when you delete at least one folder&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.03_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.3 – The Recently Deleted folder appears when you delete at least one folder</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Recently Deleted</strong> folder. The <strong class="bold">Recently Deleted</strong> screen appears, listing all notes<a id="_idIndexMarker857"/> you have deleted.</li>
				<li>Swipe left on a note to display a folder and a Delete icon, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.4</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.4 – The Recently Deleted screen displays previously deleted notes&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.4 – The Recently Deleted screen displays previously deleted notes</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Folder</strong> icon. A <strong class="bold">Select a folder</strong> screen <a id="_idIndexMarker858"/>appears, letting you choose a folder where you <a id="_idIndexMarker859"/>can put the note, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.5</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.5 – The Select a folder screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.5 – The Select a folder screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap a folder or tap <strong class="bold">New Folder</strong> to store your note in a new folder.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you understand<a id="_idIndexMarker860"/> how folders let you organize notes on your iPhone, the<a id="_idIndexMarker861"/> next step is to start creating notes so that you can capture your<a id="_idTextAnchor552"/><a id="_idTextAnchor553"/> ideas.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor554"/>Creating a new note</h2>
			<p>When you create a<a id="_idIndexMarker862"/> new note, you must define the folder where you want to store that note. Of course, you can always move that note to a different folder later. </p>
			<p>To create a new note, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the Back button in the upper-left corner of the screen until the <strong class="bold">Folders</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the folder where you want to store a new note. Notice that a New Note icon appears in the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.6</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.6 – The New Note icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.6 – The New Note icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the New Note icon. A blank note screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.7</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.7 – A new note&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.07_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.7 – A ne<a id="_idTextAnchor555"/><a id="_idTextAnchor556"/>w note</p>
			<p>Once you create a<a id="_idIndexMarker863"/> new note, you have several options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Type text.</li>
				<li>Create a table.</li>
				<li>Create a checklist.</li>
				<li>Add a picture from the photo library or the camera.</li>
				<li>Draw.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor557"/>Typing and editing text</h1>
			<p>The most common use<a id="_idIndexMarker864"/> for a note is to type and edit text. To type text in a note, simply tap where you want<a id="_idIndexMarker865"/> to insert text and type using the virtual keyboard that<a id="_idIndexMarker866"/> appears at the bottom of the screen.</p>
			<p>To select a single word, you have two options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Press and hold a fingertip over the word.</li>
				<li>Double-tap the word.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To select an entire paragraph, triple-tap<a id="_idIndexMarker867"/> any word in that paragraph. As soon as you select any text, a beginning and ending vertical line appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.8</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.8 – Two vertical lines define the beginning and end of selected text&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.08_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.8 – Two vertical lines define the beginning and end of selected text</p>
			<p>To select more or less text, drag these two vertical lines in any direction. Tap the selected text and a pop-up menu appears letting you choose the <strong class="bold">Cut</strong>, <strong class="bold">Copy</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Paste</strong> commands. </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Cut</strong> removes selected text. <strong class="bold">Copy</strong> duplicates selected text. <strong class="bold">Paste</strong> inserts previously cut or copied text. If you have not cut or copied any text, the paste command won't do anything.</p>
			<p>By using the <strong class="bold">Cut</strong> and <strong class="bold">Paste</strong> commands, you can move text from one location to another. By <a id="_idIndexMarker868"/>using the <strong class="bold">Copy</strong> and <strong class="bold">Paste</strong> commands, you <a id="_idIndexMarker869"/>can duplicate text to <a id="_idIndexMarker870"/>place in a<a id="_idIndexMarker871"/> second location.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor558"/>Formatting text</h1>
			<p>Once you've typed text, you have the option<a id="_idIndexMarker872"/> of formatting that text to choose a different appearance or style (bold, italics, or underline), along with indenting text or creating<a id="_idIndexMarker873"/> numbered or bullet lists. Formatting gives you a way to emphasize some or all of your text stored in a note.</p>
			<p>To format text in a note, follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap on the note that contains the text you want to format.</li>
				<li>Select the text you want to format (double-tap a word and/or modify the selection). Notice a <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon that appears above the virtual keyboard, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.9</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.9 – The + icon above the virtual keyboard&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.9 – The + icon above the virtual keyboard</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon. A list of icons<a id="_idIndexMarker874"/> appears above the virtual keyboard, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.10</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.10 – Icons above the virtual keyboard&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.10_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.10 – Icons above the virtual keyboard</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <a id="_idIndexMarker875"/>Formatting icon. A list of formatting options appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.11</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.11 – Formatting options&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.11_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.11 – Formatting options</p></li>
				<li>Slide your finger left and right over the highlighted <strong class="bold">Body</strong> and you'll see other options, such as <strong class="bold">Title</strong> and <strong class="bold">Subheading</strong>. By tapping one of these other options, you can alter the <a id="_idIndexMarker876"/>appearance of the selected text.</li>
				<li>Tap the Bold, Italics, Underline, or Strikethrough<a id="_idIndexMarker877"/> icons to change the selected text.</li>
				<li>Tap the three different list icons, in the bottom-left corner, to create dashed, numbered, or bullet lists. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Body</strong> again to convert a list back into text.</li>
				<li>Tap the right and left indent icons in the bottom-right corner. </li>
				<li>Tap the close (<strong class="bold">X</strong>) icon in the upper-right corner of these formatting options to make them go away. The virtual keyboard appears again.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When typing text, you may want to align text in rows and columns. Rather than trying to align text manually, it's much easier to create a table instead.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor559"/>Using tables</h1>
			<p>Tables let you organize data in rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet. By using tables, you can align text in ways not possible through ordinary indentation.</p>
			<p>To see<a id="_idIndexMarker878"/> how to create <a id="_idIndexMarker879"/>and use tables, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap on the note where you want to add a table. The virtual keyboard and row of icons appears. The Table icon appears on the far left, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.12</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.12 – The Table icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.12 – The Table icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Table</strong> icon. A table appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.13</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.13 – A table in a note&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.13_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.13 – A table in a note</p></li>
				<li>Tap in a cell and type text.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each time you<a id="_idIndexMarker880"/> create a table, the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app creates a 2 x 2 table. If you need to, you<a id="_idIndexMarker881"/> can add or delete rows and columns. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor560"/>Modifying table rows and columns</h2>
			<p>When you create<a id="_idIndexMarker882"/> a table, you may need additional rows or columns. Likewise, a table may have too many rows and columns. At any time, you can adjust the size of a table.</p>
			<p>To modify rows or columns in a table, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap inside the table you want to modify. A three dot icon appears above a column and to the left of the rows (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.13</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap this three dot icon to display a menu to add or delete a row or column, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.14</em>: <div><img alt="Figure 15.14 – Adding or deleting rows and columns&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.14 – Adding or deleting rows and columns</p></li>
				<li>(Optional:) Drag the size of the row or column to select multiple rows or columns you wish to delete.</li>
				<li>Tap an option such as <strong class="bold">Add Row</strong> or <strong class="bold">Delete Column</strong> to modify the size of your table. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Remember that if you delete a row or column, you also delete any text stored in that row or<a id="_idIndexMarker883"/> column.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor561"/>Moving and copying rows and columns</h2>
			<p>Oftentimes, you may<a id="_idIndexMarker884"/> have text in a row or column and then decide it should <a id="_idIndexMarker885"/>appear somewhere else in that table. You can use the cut, copy, and paste commands on entire rows or columns that contain text.</p>
			<p>To move or copy text stored in rows or columns in a table, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the three dot icon above the column or to the left of the row you want to cut or copy. A menu appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.15</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.15 – Cutting or copying a row or column&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.15 – Cutting or copying a row or column</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Cut</strong> or <strong class="bold">Copy</strong>. (The <strong class="bold">Cut</strong> command only cuts text, not the actual row or column.)</li>
				<li>Tap in the row or column where you want to paste the cut or copied text. </li>
				<li>Tap the three dot icon above the column or to the left of the row. A menu appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.16</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.16 – Pasting cut or copied text&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.16_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.16 – Pasting cut or copied text</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Paste</strong>. Your cut or copied text appears in the row or column.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Moving or copying text<a id="_idIndexMarker886"/> around a table lets you modify a table, but <a id="_idIndexMarker887"/>sometimes you may want to copy a complete table so you can paste it in another note.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor562"/>Copying a table</h2>
			<p>Rather than copy text stored in rows <a id="_idIndexMarker888"/>or columns, you can copy an entire table along with any text stored inside. </p>
			<p>To copy a table, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap inside the table you want to copy. Notice that the Table icon above the virtual keyboard now displays a black dot in the lower-left corner, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.17</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.17 – The Table icon when the cursor appears inside a table&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.17 – The Table icon when the cursor appears inside a table</p></li>
				<li>Tap the Table icon. A list <a id="_idIndexMarker889"/>of options appears on the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.18</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.18 – Options for manipulating an entire table&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.18 – Options for manipulating an entire table</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Copy Table</strong>.</li>
				<li>Press and hold a fingertip at a new location where you want to paste the copied table. A menu appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Paste</strong>. Your copied table now appears.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Copying a table can be handy, but if you notice the list of options in <em class="italic">Figure 15.18</em>, several other options are also available, such as sharing a table.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-259"><a id="_idTextAnchor563"/>Sharing a table</h2>
			<p>If you create a table with text, you may<a id="_idIndexMarker890"/> want to share this information with others through AirDrop, <strong class="bold">Messages</strong>, Mail, or another app installed on your iPhone. By using AirDrop, you can send a table as a text file to another Apple product such as a Mac. By using <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> or Mail, you can send a copy of your table to friends or co-workers.</p>
			<p>To share a table, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap inside the table you want to share. Notice that the Table icon above the virtual keyboard now displays a black dot in the lower-left corner (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.17</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Table</strong> icon. A list of options appears on the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.18</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Share Table</strong>. A list of ways to share a table appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.19</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.19 – Options for sharing a table&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.19_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.19 – Options for sharing a table</p></li>
				<li>Tap a person's name or method to share your table, such as tapping <strong class="bold">AirDrop</strong>, <strong class="bold">Messages</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Mail</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Tables contain text, but you can<a id="_idIndexMarker891"/> convert a table into plain text if you no longer want to align text in rows and columns.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor564"/>Converting tables to text</h2>
			<p>Tables can be <a id="_idIndexMarker892"/>useful for aligning<a id="_idIndexMarker893"/> text, but the lines that make up a table can be distracting. For that reason, you might want to convert a table to text. <em class="italic">Figure 15.20</em> shows a table and then how text appears after converting the table to text:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.20 – Converting a table to text&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.20_B14100.jpg"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.20 – Converting a table to text</p>
			<p>To convert a table to text, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap inside the table you want to convert. Notice that the Table icon above the virtual keyboard now displays a black dot in the lower-left corner (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.17</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the Table icon. A list of options appears on the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.18</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Convert Table</strong>. The text now appears without a table.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Converting a table to text gets rid of a table but preserves its text. However, you may eventually want to delete a table and all the text inside.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor565"/>Deleting a table</h2>
			<p>When you<a id="_idIndexMarker894"/> no longer need a table, you can delete the entire table, including any text stored inside that table. </p>
			<p>To delete a table, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap inside the table you want to delete. Notice that the Table icon above the virtual keyboard now displays a black dot in the lower-left corner (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.17</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the Table icon. A list of options appears on the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.18</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete Table</strong>. The text now appears without a table.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Tables can help organize text, but for another way to organize text, consider using checklists.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor566"/>Creating checklists</h1>
			<p>Many people take notes to create<a id="_idIndexMarker895"/> to-do lists and checklists of tasks they need to get done. Checklists let you create a list of items with the ability to tap on a circle to the left of each item to mark it as done.</p>
			<p>To see how to create a checklist, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap in the location where you want to create a checklist. Notice a <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon that appears above the virtual keyboard (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.9</em>). (If you already see icons above the virtual keyboard, skip this step.)</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon to display icons above the virtual keyboard.</li>
				<li>As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.21</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.21 – The Checklist icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.21_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.21 – The Checklist icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Checklist</strong> icon. An empty circle appears in the note,</li>
				<li>Type some<a id="_idIndexMarker896"/> text and tap the <strong class="bold">Return</strong> key on the virtual keyboard to create another checklist item.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Checklist</strong> icon again to stop creating empty circles.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've created a checklist, you can always mark off items by tapping in the empty circle that appears to the left of each item, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.22</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.22 – Check marks marking off items in a checklist&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.22_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.22 – Check marks marking off items in a checklist</p>
			<p>Tapping this circle toggles between showing an empty circle and a checkmark in it.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor567"/>Adding pictures to a note</h1>
			<p>The whole purpose of notes<a id="_idIndexMarker897"/> is to capture your ideas and information. Sometimes, typing text is fine, but other times, you may want to capture a picture either from the iPhone's camera or<a id="_idIndexMarker898"/> using a picture stored in your photo library. </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app offers three ways to add a picture to a note, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.23</em>:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.23 – Three options for adding pictures to notes</p>
			<p>The options are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scan Documents</strong> – Lets you crop an image taken with a camera, but does not save it in the Photo Library</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Take Photo or Video</strong> – Captures a photo or video from the iPhone camera, but does not save it in the Photo Library</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Choose Photo or Video</strong> – Retrieves an image or video stored in the Photo Library</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor568"/>Cropping images into a note</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Scan Documents</strong> option<a id="_idIndexMarker899"/> is meant to capture images of important papers and let <a id="_idIndexMarker900"/>you crop them, but you can use this option to capture any image with the iPhone camera and crop it before inserting it in a note.</p>
			<p>To capture and crop a picture for a note, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap in the location where you want to add a picture. Notice a <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon that appears above the virtual keyboard (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.9</em>). (If you already see icons above the virtual keyboard, skip this step.)</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon to display icons above the virtual keyboard, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.24</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.24 – The Camera icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.24_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.24 – The Camera icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the Camera icon. A list of <a id="_idIndexMarker901"/>options appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.23</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Scan Documents</strong>. Aim your iPhone<a id="_idIndexMarker902"/> camera at the object you want to capture, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.25</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.25 – Capturing an image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.25_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.25 – Capturing an image</p></li>
				<li>Tap the white<a id="_idIndexMarker903"/> button to capture an image. Cropping circles appear around the image.</li>
				<li>Drag these cropping circles<a id="_idIndexMarker904"/> to define the image you want to keep, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.26</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.26 – Cropping an image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.26_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.26 – Cropping an image</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Keep Scan</strong>. Your cropped image <a id="_idIndexMarker905"/>appears in the note.</li>
				<li>Tap on the cropped image in<a id="_idIndexMarker906"/> your note. A list of icons appears at the bottom of the screen, which allows you to modify the image further, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.27</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.27 – Modifying a cropped image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.27_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.27 – Modifying a cropped image</p></li>
				<li>Tap the Crop icon and <a id="_idIndexMarker907"/>crop the image if necessary.</li>
				<li>Tap the Adjust icon<a id="_idIndexMarker908"/> and choose from a variety of ways to adjust the appearance of the image, such as <strong class="bold">Grayscale</strong> or <strong class="bold">Black &amp; White</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap the Rotate icon to rotate the image to the left. </li>
				<li>Tap the Delete icon if you want to remove the cropped image from the note.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Cropping an image can be fine, but sometimes you just want to capture an entire picture or video and insert it into a note.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-265"><a id="_idTextAnchor569"/>Adding images and videos to a note</h2>
			<p>By using the iPhone camera, you <a id="_idIndexMarker909"/>can capture a still image or a video to<a id="_idIndexMarker910"/> add to a note. When you <a id="_idIndexMarker911"/>capture an image or video within a <a id="_idIndexMarker912"/>note, that image or video will not be saved to the Photo Library.</p>
			<p>To capture a picture or video for a note, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap in the location where you want to add a picture. Notice a <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon that appears above the virtual keyboard (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.9</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon to display icons above the virtual keyboard (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.24</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the Camera icon. A list of options appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.23</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Take a Photo or Video</strong>. </li>
				<li>Choose <code>Video</code> or <code>Photo</code> and tap the <a id="_idIndexMarker913"/>white (or red if recording video) button. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Use Photo</strong> or <strong class="bold">Use Video</strong> button. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Rather<a id="_idIndexMarker914"/> than capture<a id="_idIndexMarker915"/> a picture through the iPhone camera, you might have the<a id="_idIndexMarker916"/> perfect picture already stored in your Photo Library.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-266"><a id="_idTextAnchor570"/>Adding a picture from the Photo Library to a note</h2>
			<p>Rather than take a picture, you <a id="_idIndexMarker917"/>could have the perfect picture or video already stored in the Photo Library. In that case, you can insert that picture <a id="_idIndexMarker918"/>or video into a note.</p>
			<p>To browse the Photo Library in order to insert a picture or video into a note, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap in the location where you want to add a picture. Notice a <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon that appears above the virtual keyboard (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.9</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon to display icons above the virtual keyboard (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.24</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the Camera icon. A list of options appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.23</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Choose Photo or Video</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap a category and tap a picture or video to insert into a note.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen to insert your selected picture or video into the note.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>While inserting a picture into a note may capture your ideas, sometimes you may want to draw something that doesn't exist. In that case, you can scribble ideas and insert them in a note.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-267"><a id="_idTextAnchor571"/>Drawing in a note</h2>
			<p>With a pencil or pen, you <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>can write text, draw pictures, or add ideas to existing text. In many ways, drawing pictures can be faster and more descriptive so the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app lets you draw images in a note as well. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note </p>
			<p class="callout">You may find it easier to create a drawing in a separate note and then cut and paste that drawing to paste into a note with existing text.</p>
			<p>To draw in a note, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Choose a folder.</li>
				<li>Tap the New Note icon to create a new note.</li>
				<li>Tap in the location where you want to add a drawing. Notice a <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon that appears above the virtual keyboard (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.9</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon to display icons above the virtual keyboard, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.28</em>:<div><img alt=" Figure 15.28 – The Drawing icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.28_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"> Figure 15.28 – The Drawing icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the Drawing icon. Icons representing different drawing tools appear at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.29</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.29 – Drawing tools&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.29_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.29 – Drawing tools</p></li>
				<li>Tap on a drawing tool <a id="_idIndexMarker920"/>and drag your fingertip across the screen to create a drawing. </li>
				<li>(Optional:) Tap a drawing tool to display a drawing thickness, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.30</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.30 – Choosing a drawing tool modification&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.30_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.30 – Choosing a drawing tool modification</p></li>
				<li>(Optional) Tap the color <a id="_idIndexMarker921"/>circle in the bottom-right corner of the screen to display a color palette so that you can tap on a color you want to choose, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.31</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.31 – Displaying a color palette&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.31_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.31 – Displaying a color palette</p>
			<p>By adding drawings to a note, you can also capture your ideas in whatever form is easiest and fastest for you, whether it be<a id="_idIndexMarker922"/> text, pictures, or drawings. Once you create one or more notes, you may need to search and password protect them.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-268"><a id="_idTextAnchor572"/>Searching notes</h1>
			<p>Once you've typed text in one or <a id="_idIndexMarker923"/>more notes, you may want to find it again. Rather than manually browse through all your notes, it's far easier to let the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app search through your text in your notes.</p>
			<p>To search for text in a note, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap on a folder that contains the notes you want to search. </li>
				<li>Tap in the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> text field at the top of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.32</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.32 – The Search text field&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.32_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.32 – The Search text field</p></li>
				<li>Tap in the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> text field and type part or all of a word or phrase you want to find. The <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app displays all matches, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.33</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.33 – Matching search results&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.33_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.33 – Matching search results</p></li>
				<li>Tap the note that contains the search result you want.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Searching notes for text can<a id="_idIndexMarker924"/> help you pinpoint the exact note you want. However, in case you just want to browse through your notes, there's another way to display your notes beyond just a list of note names.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-269"><a id="_idTextAnchor573"/>Viewing notes as thumbnails</h1>
			<p>By default, the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app lists <a id="_idIndexMarker925"/>your notes by name. For a more visual way to display your notes, you can display notes as thumbnail icons. This lets you view the text in each note to help you find the one you want.</p>
			<p>To toggle between showing your notes in a folder as a list or as thumbnails, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap on a folder to show a list of all notes stored in that folder.</li>
				<li>Tap on the three dot icon in the upper-right corner of the screen to display a menu, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.34</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.34 – Switching to Gallery view to show notes as thumbnail images&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.34_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.34 – Switching to Gallery view to show notes as thumbnail images</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">View as Gallery</strong> to toggle between <a id="_idIndexMarker926"/>showing your notes as a list or as thumbnail images.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>No matter how you view or search your notes, you may have some notes that are more important than others. To protect your privacy, consider password protecting a note.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-270"><a id="_idTextAnchor574"/>Password protecting notes</h1>
			<p>If anyone gets a hold of<a id="_idIndexMarker927"/> your iPhone and unlocks it, they can read all your notes. In case you have some important notes that you don't want others to read, you can password protect them.</p>
			<p>To password protect a note, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap on a folder that contains the note you want to password protect. </li>
				<li>Tap on the note you want to password protect. </li>
				<li>Tap the three dot icon in the <a id="_idIndexMarker928"/>upper-right corner of the screen. A menu appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.35</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.35 – The Lock icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.35_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.35 – The Lock icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Lock</strong> icon. A Set Password screen appears, which either asks for Face ID or Touch ID.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you have set a password for a note, you can lock and unlock it by repeating the preceding steps. A lock icon appears to let you know which notes are locked, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.36</em>:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-271"><a id="_idTextAnchor575"/>Capturing audio with Voice Memos</h1>
			<p>Some people prefer talking rather than writing their thoughts down. As an alternative, you can capture your<a id="_idIndexMarker933"/> spoken thoughts using the Voice Memos app.</p>
			<p>To capture an<a id="_idIndexMarker934"/> audio recording, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Voice Memos </strong>app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the red Record button and start talking.</li>
				<li>Tap the red Stop button when you're done talking.</li>
				<li>The Voice Memos screen displays your audio memo with the time, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.39</em>:</li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.39 – The Voice Memos screen listing an audio recording</p>
			<p>After you have recorded a <a id="_idIndexMarker935"/>voice memo, you can tap the Play button to<a id="_idIndexMarker936"/> listen to it, or drag the slider to move to different parts of the audio file. You can also tap in the location text of your audio memo if you want to type something more descriptive.</p>
			<p>To share an audio file, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Voice Memos</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the three dots icon (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.39</em>). A menu appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.40</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.40 – Tapping the three dots icon displays a menu&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.40_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.40 – Tapping the three dots icon displays a menu</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Share</strong>. A list of different devices and methods for sharing appears.</li>
				<li>Tap a device name or <a id="_idIndexMarker937"/>method, such as <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> or Mail, to share your voice memo.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you record a voice<a id="_idIndexMarker938"/> memo, you can go back and overwrite part of that voice memo or add new audio to that voice memo. To see how to modify an existing voice memo, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Voice Memos</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the three dots icon (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.39</em>). A menu appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 15.40</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit Recording</strong>. An edit voice memo screen appears showing the existing audio file, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.41</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 15.41 – The edit voice memo screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_15.41_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 15.41 – The edit voice memo screen</p></li>
				<li>Swipe the <a id="_idIndexMarker939"/>audio file left or right. When the blue vertical line appears <a id="_idIndexMarker940"/>over existing audio, a <strong class="bold">REPLACE</strong> button appears at the bottom of the screen. When the blue vertical line appears at the end of the audio, a Resume button appears at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">REPLACE</strong> or Resume button and record more audio. </li>
				<li>Tap the Pause button when you're done.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>While you might want to edit a<a id="_idIndexMarker941"/> voice memo to add new ideas, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker942"/>eventually want to get rid of a voice memo altogether. To delete a voice memo, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Voice Memos</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the voice memo you want to delete.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> icon. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Voice memos can be handy for capturing ideas in case you can't or don't like to type in the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app. By using voice memos, yo<a id="_idTextAnchor576"/>u can capture your thoughts as fast as you can talk. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-272"><a id="_idTextAnchor577"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app can be the best way to capture your thoughts wherever you take your iPhone. Not only can you type and format text, but you can also capture pictures or video to insert in a note as well. </p>
			<p>To help you stay organized, consider creating separate folders to store related notes such as notes for work and notes for personal use. You can use notes to create daily to-do lists or just thoughts you have during the day that you won't want to forget.</p>
			<p>You might also use the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app as a fast way to store useful information, such as website addresses or pictures of interesting places. The <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> app can help you save any information you think is worth keeping. If you prefer not to write anything down, consider using the Voice Memo app instead to capture your spoken thoughts. </p>
			<p>Since most people take their iPhone everywhere they go, one useful feature is the Maps app, which can not only show you where you are, but also give you directions to get to wherever you want to go, which is the topic of the next chapter.</p>
