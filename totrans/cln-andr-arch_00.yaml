- en: As an application's code base increases, it becomes harder for developers to
    maintain existing features and introduce new ones. In this clean architecture
    book, you'll learn how to identify when and how this problem emerges and how to
    structure your code to overcome it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book starts by explaining clean architecture principles and Android architecture
    components and then explores the tools, frameworks, and libraries involved. You'll
    learn how to structure your application in the Data and Domain layers, the technologies
    that go in each layer, and the role that each layer plays in keeping your application
    clean. You'll understand how to arrange the code into these two layers and the
    components involved in assembling them. Finally, we'll cover the Presentation
    layer and the patterns that can be applied to have a decoupled and testable code
    base.

    architecture principles and have the knowledge you need to maintain and test the
    application easily.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for Android developers who want to learn about managing the complexity
    of their applications and is also highly recommended for intermediate or advanced
    Android developers looking for a go-to guide for clean architecture and the integration
    of various Android technologies. New developers familiar with the fundamentals
    of Android app development will find this book useful, too.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B18320_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Getting Started with
    Clean Architecture*, starts by presenting the evolution of Android apps with regards
    to how business logic was structured, and the problems caused by these approaches.
    It will then transition to how certain patterns were applied to tackle these issues,
    revealing other sets of issues. Finally, the concept of clean architecture will
    be introduce, as well as how its principles can be used to solve some of the problems
    presented previously.'

    will be used later in the book, such as Kotlin flows and coroutines, Retrofit,
    Room, and DataStore.'

    in Android Applications*, provides a quick overview of dependency injection and
    how it works. It briefly explores some of the dependency injection tools available
    for Android development, ending with the Hilt dependency injection framework,
    about which it goes into a more detailed explanation because it will be used in
    many of the exercises in the book.'

    covers the benefits of clean architecture by analyzing an example of an application
    that implements the concepts and then adding instrumentation tests with Espresso
    and Jetpack Compose. The introduction of UI tests serves as a good example of
    how we can inject and change certain behaviors in the application for testing
    purposes without needing to modify the application''s code.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll need the Android Studio IDE installed on your computer (version Arctic
    Fox 2020.3.1 Patch 3 or above) and Java 8 to be installed. Using later versions
    of Java such as Java 11 might cause errors when building some of the exercises.
    Knowing how to trigger builds on an emulator or device and Gradle Synchronizations
    from Android Studio is recommended before attempting the exercises presented in
    the book.

    is loaded, introducing in-memory caches, or integrating new network calls to fetch
    additional data for the users. You can also improve the instrumentation testing
    by adding interaction with the list of data and opening new screens and asserting
    that the correct data is displayed.
