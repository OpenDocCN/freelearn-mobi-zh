- en: Welcome to *Application Development in iOS 7*. With the release of iOS 7, Apple
    has completely changed the way we developers think about mobile application design
    and development. In addition to a complete visual overhaul, iOS 7 offers hundreds
    of new API and SDK improvements as well as a completely revamped development environment,
    Xcode 5\. This book will walk you through a step-by-step process of building a
    fully functional application from scratch. By the end of this book, you will have
    a complete understanding of many of the major changes to iOS 7 development and
    will be ready to start making better applications for your users!

    the implementation of Auto Layout 2.0 in iOS 7\. When Auto Layout was first introduced,
