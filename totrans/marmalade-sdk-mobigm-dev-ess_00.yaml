- en: The modern mobile device is an immensely powerful piece of equipment. Technology
    has advanced to such an extent that the current generation of cell phones and
    tablets are able to host games and applications that are both graphically and
    sonically impressive, and can even be compared to the titles available on home
    consoles and computers.

- en: However, writing a game that will run on the plethora of available devices is
    difficult. There are a number of different platforms to support (for example,
    Android and iOS) and each platform can have devices that range considerably in
    terms of capabilities and processing power.

- en: This is where the Marmalade SDK comes to the rescue! Marmalade is a cross-platform
    solution that allows us to write the source code for a video game once in C++
    (a language that most video game developers will already be familiar with) and
    then deploy it to a number of different platforms, including iOS, Android, and
    BlackBerry PlayBook.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with Marmalade"), *Getting
    Started with Marmalade*: We start our journey into the world of the Marmalade
    SDK by learning how to install the SDK and build a simple "Hello World" application.
    We will then discover how to deploy and run the finished program to a number of
    different mobile platforms.'

    *Resource Management and 2D Graphics Rendering*: Most video games are media-rich
    experiences packed full of superb graphics and stunning sound effects and music.
    In this chapter we will first look at how Marmalade makes it easy for us to load
    graphics and other resources into memory by using the built-in resource handling
    system. We will then discover how to render simple two-dimensional graphics on
    the screen.'

    need to allow the user to provide input to control the action; so in this chapter
    we will be looking at how to respond to keypad, touch screen, and accelerometer
    inputs.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. 3D Graphics Rendering"), *3D Graphics Rendering*:
    Mobile devices now feature graphics processing units that enable them to easily
    render beautiful 3D graphics. After a brief overview of the basics of 3D rendering,
    we will then learn how to use Marmalade to render a spinning cube, first by generating
    the 3D model data in code and later by discovering how we can use a 3D modeling
    package to create and export a 3D model that can be loaded and drawn in a Marmalade
    application.'

    make our 3D graphics more interesting by making them animated.'

    Localization"), *Implementing Fonts, User Interfaces, and Localization*: Before
    a user can even play the first level of our game, they will first need to navigate
    its menu system. This chapter covers Marmalade''s support for font rendering,
    the ways in which a user interface can be constructed, and finishes up with a
    look at how to localize a game so it can support multiple languages.'

    Video*: Sound and music are both very important aspects of a video game and can
    make a game feel much more immersive and exciting, so learning how to add these
    elements to a game is the main aim of this chapter. Marmalade. also allows us
    to display full motion video clips, so we''ll take a brief look at this too.'

    a Wide Range of Devices*: Different mobile devices have different capabilities
    and can also vary in terms of both main processor and graphics rendering power.
    In this chapter we look at ways in which Marmalade helps us to support as wide
    a range of devices as possible by allowing our game to adapt to the hardware it
    is running on. We''ll also look at using Marmalade''s built-in support for compressing
    and decompressing files to reduce the size of our game''s installation package.'

    to us for adding online features to our games, from integration with Facebook
    to displaying adverts as a possible revenue stream.'

    Kit (EDK)*: While the Marmalade SDK does a great job of standardizing most of
    the normal requirements of writing a videogame, such as displaying graphics or
    playing sounds, there sometimes comes the requirement to access a device feature
    that Marmalade does not support directly. This chapter shows how we can get access
    to the underlying SDK on Windows, iOS, and Android in order to access device features
    that we would otherwise not be able to.'
