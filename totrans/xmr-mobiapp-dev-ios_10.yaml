- en: Animation is the illusion of movement of static (still) images. To do this,
    typically something has to move roughly every 1/25th of a second. The more the
    steps used for moving something, the smoother the motion and the easier it is
    to fool the brain. We've already seen [Chapter 6](../Text/part0035.html#page "Chapter 6. Events"),
    *Events*, how animation can be achieved using `UIAlertView`. Now we need to see
    how we can do this normally using the `CoreAnimation` and `CoreGraphics` namespaces.
    This is not going to be an exhaustive study but it will give you a grounding in
    the basics.

- en: I will assume here that there is a small-enough `UIImageView` widget set onto
    a view (say 122 x 122) in the middle of the screen. As before, the image is loaded
    in, but this time the `CoreGraphics` image is required.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For animation, `CoreAnimation` needs to be used. However, before doing a rotation
    animation, let's start off on something simpler—moving something across the screen
    and back. To do this, let's look at some code.

- en: The bindings between Xamarin.iOS and the underpinning Objective-C become very
    visible for animation and drawing in general (the binding is the selector)
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Underpinning bindings
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the preceding example, the code is creating an interface layer for the underpinning
    Objective-C. The compiler handles this in a slightly different manner compared
    to normal code. Adding this sort of `Selector` code can be used in other ways
    as well (for example, to access private API code—though this should be avoided
    as it will debar apps from being accepted into the app store). It should be noted
    that the bindings to the Objective-C layer may sometimes cause issues with submission
    to the Apple store.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, once a class has gone out of scope, the **garbage collector** (**GC**)
    will free up memory used by the processes within that class. However, as Xamarin.iOS
    works as a binding layer to the underpinning Objective-C, there are times when
    freeing memory becomes important; this mostly happens when dealing with animation
    and graphics.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE7]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The code executes and loads `UIImageView` with the image as directed by the
    returned string. If `condition` is met (that is, it's `true`), the method returns.
    If `condition` is not met, the method jumps to `callNewMethod`. Neither of these
    are big issues, except that the GC does not get called until the class itself
    goes out of scope. So any memory occupied by the `UIImageView` control is still
    used, despite it only being used for three lines in one class. With too many images
    and too many manipulations, memory soon vanishes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you consider an average animation, there may be 300 images with backgrounds
    and so the memory is soon drained.
  prefs: []

    calls the GC once it has gone out of scope. The following lines of code demonstrate
    how to do this:'

- en: While this looks similar, the image being created is used and once completed,
    the memory being used is freed up again, rather than having to wait until the
    class goes out of scope.

    by conversion to a bitmap. The following gives you an idea of how to do the rotation.
    Altering `RotateCTM` and `TranslateCTM` from positive to negative (and vice versa)
    should give different results.

    has been a whistle-stop over the subject, I would recommend you have a look at
    *Learning MonoTouch* by *Michael Bluestein*, Pearson Education, Inc. His book
    covers the topic in much greater detail than space allows here.
