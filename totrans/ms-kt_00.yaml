- en: Kotlin is a programming language created by JetBrains that runs on the **Java
    Virtual Machine** (**JVM**). It was designed to address issues such as verbosity,
    null pointer exceptions, concurrency challenges, and the lack of functional support
    found in Java. Kotlin offers a more modern and concise programming approach while
    still being compatible with existing Java code and libraries. Google recognized
    Kotlin as a primary language for building Android apps, leading to significant
    efforts to support developers. This book adopts an industry-focused approach,
    preparing you for the role of an Android developer in any company. It follows
    current best practices recommended by Google’s Android team, providing insights
    based on practical experience.

- en: With practical examples, the book guides you through developing Android apps
    using Kotlin, imparting hands-on knowledge that is essential for becoming a proficient
    Android developer. Topics include building apps with Jetpack Compose, incorporating
    Material Design 3 for a personalized touch, and structuring apps in the MVVM architecture.
    The guide further demonstrates how to enhance your app’s architecture with features
    such as dependency injection, use Jetpack Libraries such as Room for local data
    persistence, and implement debugging techniques. It covers testing, identifying
    code issues using tools such as Ktlint and Detekt, and guides you through the
    publication process on Google Play Store. Automation of consecutive releases through
    GitHub Actions and the distribution of test builds using Firebase App Distribution
    are also explored. Additionally, the book addresses app improvement strategies,
    including crash reporting tools, tips for boosting user engagement, and insights
    on securing your app.
