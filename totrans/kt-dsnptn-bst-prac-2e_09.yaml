    the system is having (that is, the system not having enough representatives).
    In contrast, *isolation* means that even if the system has issues with a phone
    line not being reliable, you don''t care.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    call center always has at least three representatives on shift. Maybe all of them
    are answering calls, or perhaps they're just patiently waiting.

    this. But if we had some extra resources, we could bring more representatives
    in to handle the incident and calm our customers. And after the cable was finally
    fixed, we could let them go back to their business. That's the system being *elastic*
    in response to the workload.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Elasticity* builds on *scalability*. For example, we could manage all of the
    incoming calls if each representative could work independently by having their
    own phone. If we had more representatives than phones, the number of phones would
    become a *bottleneck*, with some representatives unable to answer any calls.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **message-driven** principle is also referred to as **asynchronous message
    passing**. So, in the previous section, we saw that if you could leave a message
    for any representative to call back, it could make the system more resilient.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*So, what if all customers only leave messages?*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, each representative could *prioritize* those messages or *batch* them.
    For example, printing all of the billing receipts together instead of working
    through the messages in a random order.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using messages also allows applying backpressure. If a representative receives
    too many messages, they may collapse from stress. To avoid that, they may text
    you to say that you'll have to wait a bit longer to receive your answer. Again,
    we're also talking about *delegation* here, as all of these principles overlap.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Messages are also *non-blocking*. After you leave the message, you don't sit
    there waiting for the representative's response. Instead, you usually go back
    to your regular tasks. The ability to perform other tasks while you wait is one
    of the cornerstones of *concurrency*.

    for collections first appeared in Java 8 with the introduction of the **Stream
    API**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite providing developers with valuable functions such as `map()`, `filter()`,
    and some of the others we already discussed, there were two major drawbacks to
    the Stream API. First, in order to use these functions, you had to migrate to
    Java 8\. And second, your collection had to be converted to something called a
    **stream**, which had all of the functions defined on it. If you want to return
    a collection again after mapping and filtering your stream, you can collect it
    back.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is also another significant difference between streams and collections.
    Unlike collections, streams can be infinite. Since Kotlin doesn't limit itself
    to only **JVM** and is also backward-compatible to Java 6, it needed to provide
    another solution for the possibility of infinite collections. This solution was
    named **sequence** to avoid clashing with Java streams when they're available.

    to understand them before moving on. Note that reactive principles are not tied
    to functional programming. You can also be reactive while writing object-oriented
    or procedural code. However, it's still easier to discuss these principles after
    learning about functional programming and its foundations.

    A cold stream, such as a *flow*, starts working only when someone subscribes to
    it. A new subscriber will usually receive all of the events. On the other hand,
    a hot stream, such as a *channel*, continuously emits events, even if nobody is
    listening to them. A new subscriber will receive only the events that were sent
    after the subscription was made.

    the stream, handling only some of the events.
