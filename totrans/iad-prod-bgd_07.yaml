    the rest of the ad; you could save the style of the **Making Memories** title
    label and apply this throughout your ad to keep a consistent style.

    the rest of the page style inline with rest of our ad. There aren't any major
    differences between our iPad map and an iPhone map, except that we used a larger
    pin image. For example, this image is 100px by 100px, compared to using standard
    resolution iPhone image of around 30px by 30px.
