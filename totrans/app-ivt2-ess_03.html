When you first create a project, the default workspace name is <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Screen1</strong></span>. You cannot change the name of Screen1, although you can change the title of the screen name. This can be done in the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Properties</strong></span> panel (as follows). The new screen name will be displayed in the Viewer and be seen by app users. Later, you may want to add more screens to your app and you can rename the subsequent screens. To build your app, you will drag Components from the Palette drawers onto the Viewer. We will be using visual components in our Fling app, so these will remain visible when dragged into the Viewer. In the subsequent chapters, we will demonstrate the use of non-visible components, which will not remain in the Viewer when added. Instead, they will be housed underneath the Viewer.</p></div></div>

Once Components are dragged into the Viewer, they will also appear in the Components panel (found in the middle right of the Designer image). The Components panel lists Components and organizes them by screens. You can collapse and expand the screen Component contents for convenience. Components are listed in columns so that it is easy to see whether they exist on their own or within other Components.</p><p class="calibre9">To illustrate that some Components are inside other Components, the Components panel will display them in a nested (indented) list. Note that when you click on a Component in the Viewer, it will be highlighted in both the Viewer and the Components panel and display editable options in the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Properties</strong></span> panel (described in the following section). And conversely, if you click on a Component in the Components panel, it will also be highlighted in the Viewer. Once a Component is clicked and it becomes active, you can either rename or delete it by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Rename</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Delete</strong></span> button or you can view or edit its settings in the Properties panel.</p></div></div>

In the subsequent chapters, you will be adding more and more Components (and Screens), so make certain that the correct item is highlighted before you change its settings. The name of the active Component (or Screen) appears at the top of the Properties pane (in the earlier Designer screenshot, the active <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Property</strong></span> is <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Screen1</strong></span> as indicated at the top of the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Properties</strong></span> panel).</p></div></div>

But, if you were starting from scratch to create your own game, you would want to make sure that you've put in the time, effort, and energy to figure out what you want it to do and what you want it to look like. We outlined the design process for mobile app creation in <a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 1. Unleashing Creativity with MIT App Inventor 2" href="part0014_split_000.html#DB7S2-9c0b907946184095a315b26c8a9b12bc">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre19">Unleashing Creativity with MIT App Inventor 2</em></span>. This may be a good time to review it.</p></div><p class="calibre9">The object of the Fling game app is to fling a moving ball with your finger to prevent it from hitting the bottom edge of the screen and ending the game. When the Play button is clicked, the ball will start moving from top to bottom. If it hits the bottom edge of the screen before the user flings it away, the game will stop and a <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Game Over</strong></span> notice will appear on the screen. The <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Reset</strong></span> button resets the ball to the top of the screen and the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Play</strong></span> button starts another round. In this game, you will learn to design the user interface using these Components: a ball, a canvas (the game board), a horizontal layout, buttons, and a label.

As shown in the following screenshot, the name Screen1 appears in three places: in the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Viewer</strong></span>, the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Components</strong></span> panel, and the Properties panel. Note that this is also true for any component added to the Viewer. When a component is highlighted (as shown with a light green box) in the Components panel, you will see the corresponding properties for it in the Properties panel. While the name Screen1 is not editable, the properties associated with Screen1 are such as the title, although we won't be changing the Screen1 Properties in Fling.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00051.jpeg" alt="Creating the UI in designer" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">To create a game interface for the Fling app, we will:</p><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Add the canvas <a id="id116" class="calibre1"/>Component to <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Screen1</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Click on the Palette drawer: <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Drawing and Animation</strong></span>.

The Canvas component will automatically be named <a id="id117" class="calibre1"/>
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Canvas1</strong></span> in the Components panel. If you were to add another Canvas, it would automatically be named Canvas2. It is possible to rename Canvas1, although we are not going to for this tutorial, since it is aptly named. You can see that it is active (as it is highlighted with a light green box) in both the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Viewer</strong></span> and the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Components</strong></span> panel. Being active means that you are able to see and edit its properties in the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Properties</strong></span> panel.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00053.jpeg" alt="Creating the UI in designer" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">The Canvas is <a id="id118" class="calibre1"/>going to hold our Ball component, so we need to make it fill the whole screen not just a tiny part of the screen like it is now.

A pop-up box will offer choices with radio buttons, as shown in the following screenshot. Click on the radio button next to <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Fill Parent</strong></span>. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">OK</strong></span> button.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00054.jpeg" alt="Creating the UI in designer" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">Repeat these steps for the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Width</strong></span>.

Since <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Ball1</strong></span> is already active, you can begin editing the options in the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Properties</strong></span> panel. Change the settings to match those shown in the following screenshot. We will actually end up changing the ball's starting position once we start programming, but this is just to get you familiar <a id="id120" class="calibre1"/>with the features available in the Properties panel.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00057.jpeg" alt="Creating the UI in designer" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">Next, you will create a menu bar at the bottom of the screen.

Drag <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">HorizontalArrangement</strong></span> to the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Viewer</strong></span> so that it sits underneath the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Canvas</strong></span> and not inside the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Canvas</strong></span>.

HorizontalArrangement should be listed in the same column under Canvas1 and not be indented like Ball1. If it is indented, it means that the HorizontalArrangement Component is inside the Canvas. We don't want that so, if it is, go to the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Viewer</strong></span> and drag the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">HorizontalArrangement</strong></span> component out of the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Canvas</strong></span> and position it below the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Canvas</strong></span>. To shrink the size of <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">HorizontalArrangement</strong></span>, edit the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Height</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Width</strong></span> options in the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Properties</strong></span> panel to match the ones below. There are two ways to check whether you did this correctly. In the Viewer, HorizontalArrangement will create white space below the gray Canvas, as shown in the preceding screenshot. And, in the Components panel, HorizontalArrangement will align with Canvas1, as shown in the following screenshot. If you accidentally did this incorrectly and dropped HorizontalArrangement inside the Canvas, there would be no white space below the gray Canvas in the <a id="id121" class="calibre1"/>Viewer and the HorizontalArrangement component would be indented and aligned directly under Ball1.</p><p class="calibre9">To resize <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">HorizontalArrangement</strong></span>, edit the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Height</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Width</strong></span> options in the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Properties</strong></span> panel to match the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00059.jpeg" alt="Creating the UI in designer" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">Next, drag a <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Button</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">User Interface</strong></span> palette drawer into the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">HorizontalArrangement</strong></span> component at the bottom of <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Screen1</strong></span>.

But we don't want to set it all the way at the top of the screen because, in the next chapter, we are going to program our app, so that, every time the ball hits the top edge, the user will score a point. To avoid scoring points by merely pressing <a id="id151" class="calibre1"/>Play or Reset, we must position the ball a little below the top edge. To do this, we need to set a pair of the (x, y) values for the Canvas. The x value is where the ball will be horizontally on the screen and the y value will be the ball's vertical position. The x value is defined as the number of pixels from the left edge of the Canvas and y is defined as the number of pixels from the top edge of the Canvas. We decided that we don't want y to be 0, as the ball would be touching the edge, so we can set the y value to something close to 0, such as 2. We can set the x value to any value along the width of the Canvas. To make the game more unpredictable, we will program the app to pick a random value for x. Then, each time the user hits Play or Reset, the ball will start at a different location horizontally on the screen (although it will always start 2 pixels from the top, since we are setting y = 2). To set the ball's starting location, we will select a block from the Ball1 drawer.</p><p class="calibre9">Click on <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Ball1</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Blocks</strong></span> panel.

You can enter <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">200</strong></span> in it and then copy and paste the block by clicking on it to highlight it (make sure it has a yellow outline). If you don't want to copy and paste, you can always drag out another <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Math 0</strong></span> block. Click on the number in the copied block and type <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">340</strong></span>. Then, place the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">200</strong></span> block into the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">from</strong></span> spot and the 340 block into the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">to</strong></span> spot.</p><p class="calibre9">Our <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">random integer from to</strong></span> block needs to fit someplace, to which block will it be giving this information? Another way to ask this question is: which block will be getting this information? If you guessed Ball, you are correct! The ball will need this information to know the angle at which it has to move. So, we need to find the ball block that represents the ball's direction. This block is called <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Ball1.Heading</strong></span>, and it represents the degrees the ball will move. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Ball1</strong></span> Blocks drawer to find the dark green <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Ball1.Heading</strong></span> <a id="id158" class="calibre1"/>block (you will need to scroll down past the gold and purple blocks to find it). Once this is on your <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Viewer</strong></span>, snap it together with the blue <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">random integer from to</strong></span> block that you just created. Then, take these connected pieces and insert them at the bottom of the gold <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">when Play_Button.Click</strong></span>. Your blocks should now look like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00086.jpeg" alt="Moving the ball" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">Now that we have the location of the ball and the direction it is heading in degrees, we need to program it to actually move. To do this, we will first set the ball to enabled. From the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Ball1</strong></span> blocks drawer, choose the dark green <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">set Ball1.Enabled to</strong></span> block. Then, from the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Logic</strong></span> blocks drawer, choose the lime green <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">true</strong></span> block at the top, as shown in the next screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00087.jpeg" alt="Moving the ball" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">Insert the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">true</strong></span> <a id="id159" class="calibre1"/>block into the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">set Ball1.Enabled to</strong></span> block and add them to the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">when Play_Button.Click</strong></span> event, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00088.jpeg" alt="Moving the ball" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">Now that the ball is ready to move, we can actually move it by setting the speed and the interval. Go back to the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Ball1</strong></span> Blocks drawer and select the dark green setter block, <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">set Ball1.Speed</strong></span>.

We've decided to have the ball move <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">10</strong></span> pixels every <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">50</strong></span> milliseconds, so we will program our blocks to look as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00089.jpeg" alt="Moving the ball" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">Insert these blocks at the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">when Play_Button.Click</strong></span> event.

Next, we need to code these events.</p><p class="calibre9">First, let's program the app to fling the ball.</p><p class="calibre9">How will the ball know when a finger touches it and how to move in another direction (not downward)? We can program these events by using a block from the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Ball1</strong></span> Blocks drawer called <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">when Ball1.Flung</strong></span>. Click on this gold event block to add it to the Viewer. You can make the ball move at any speed you like, but we are going to keep it going at the same speed, just in a different direction. To do this, you can copy and paste the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">set Ball1.Speed to</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">set Ball1.Interval to</strong></span> blocks from the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">when Play_Button.Click</strong></span> event (note that when you click on the dark green set block and copy and paste it, the blue getter block attached to it will also copy and paste). Add these blocks to the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">when Ball1.Flung</strong></span> <a id="id162" class="calibre1"/>event to resemble the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00091.jpeg" alt="Flinging the ball" class="calibre11"/></div><p class="calibre12"> </p><p class="calibre9">Next, we will reposition the direction of the ball to go upward (when it is flung by a finger). We could set the heading to a degree between 10 and 170 (see <span class="strong"><em class="calibre19">image #39</em></span>) or we could make the ball go in the upward direction with an equation. Let's practice equations more. Copy and paste the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">set Ball1.Heading</strong></span> block from the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">when Play_Button.Click</strong></span> event (remember the heading block determines the angle at which the ball will move). Drag it to the bottom of the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">when Ball1.Flung</strong></span> event. We want the ball to go in the opposite direction than the direction in which it was heading, not to a random integer, so you can delete the attached blue block by highlighting it and pressing <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">delete</strong></span> on your keyboard or by clicking on the blue block and dragging it to trash. To get the ball to go in the opposite direction, we are going to subtract the current ball's heading (direction) from 360 degrees (the total number of degrees possible). To code this, choose the minus block from the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Math Blocks</strong></span> drawer. In the first open space, add the number <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">360</strong></span>. Copy and paste the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">50</strong></span> blue block from the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">when Ball1.Flung</strong></span> event and change the number to <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">360</strong></span>. Insert it into the open space to the left of the minus sign.</p><p class="calibre9">Next, from the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Ball1</strong></span> Blocks drawer, select the light green getter block, <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre10">Ball1.Heading</strong></span>. Insert it in the open space to the right of the minus sign (line up the block nib with the open nib). Here is what we have coded: when the ball is touched and flung, the program will move the ball's direction (or heading) to 360 degrees minus the old direction (or heading).
