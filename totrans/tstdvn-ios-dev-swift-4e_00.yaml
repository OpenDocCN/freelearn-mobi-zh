- en: Automatic tests are an essential part of agile software development, especially
    unit tests, with their quick and reliable feedback helping developers to keep
    projects maintainable and clean. **Test-driven development** (**TDD**) methodology
    gives developers clear rules about how to build scalable, maintainable, and –
    as such – agile projects. Often, once the initial aversion to writing tests before
    the code is overcome, developers stick to TDD because they feel that their code
    is better and they are more confident in the result.

- en: In this book, we will explore how to write unit tests for many different aspects
    of iOS development for iOS 15+. All that will be done in the context of test-driven
    development. The book starts with an introduction to testing in general and TDD
    in iOS apps and continues with building a complete app throughout the book. It
    covers basic UI structures, the Combine framework, async/await, and even SwiftUI.

- en: After you've worked through the book and challenged yourself in the exercises,
    you will be able to write tests for a variety of code in iOS development, and
    you will have the tools to decide what to learn next in your journey to become
    an expert in test-driven iOS development.

    improves the structure and maintainability of your apps. This book will guide
    you through the steps for creating a complete app using TDD and cover the core
    elements of iOS apps: view controllers, views, navigation, networking, Combine,
    and SwiftUI.'
