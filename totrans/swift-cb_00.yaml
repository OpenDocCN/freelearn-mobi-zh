- en: Since Apple announced the Swift programming language at WWDC 2014, it has gone
    on to become one of the fastest-growing programming languages. Swift is modern,
    open-source, and easy to use, and therefore its usefulness can extend beyond Apple's
    ecosystem, giving it the potential to be used across all platforms and for any
    scenario.

- en: '[Chapter 1](f9d48715-ffca-464f-95bf-722958f02e72.xhtml)*,* *Swift Building
    Blocks,* introduces you to the basic building blocks of Swift 5, its syntax, and
    the functionalities of basic Swift constructs. Also, this chapter will introduce
    you to Apple’s Xcode IDE and Swift Playgrounds, which provides an ideal way to
    create, execute, debug, and understand the recipes contained in this book, thus
    setting you up to initiate the development process. In this chapter, you will
    learn how to write your first Swift program and understand the various basic elements
    of the Swift language.'

    Blocks,* teaches you how to create more complex structures on the basis of the
    building blocks that you studied in the first chapter and the functionalities
    provided by the Swift standard library. You will get an understanding of how to
    bundle variables into tuples, order data with the help of an array, and store
    key-value pairs with dictionaries. You will also learn how to use the property
    observers and control the access to and visibility of your code. Then, you will
    learn how to extend the functionalities of your code using the extensions.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](d72c34de-445b-45b7-9a25-c16ba63e1c64.xhtml), *Data Wrangling with
    Swift Control Flow*, will teach you that programming is all about making decisions,
    therefore in this chapter, we will explore how to make decisions on the basis
    of the information gained and how to alter the control flow of the code. You will
    learn how to conditionally execute your code with `if`/`else` statements. You
    will also learn how to control the flow of execution of your code with `switch`
    statements, and then loop this code by understanding how to use `for` and `while`
    loops. You will then understand how to handle Swift errors with `try`, `throw`,
    `do`, and `catch` statements. Also, we will cover how a `defer` statement can
    be useful to change state once a function''s execution is complete or to clean
    up values that are no longer needed.'

    and Nested Types,* provides you with an understanding of two advanced features
    of Swift, which are generics and operators. Using these features, you will learn
    how to build functionalities that are flexible and well defined. Also, you will
    understand how nested types allow logical grouping, access, and namespacing for
    your constructs.'

    library provided by frameworks such as Foundation and UIKit. Learning how to use
    these functionalities will help you make full use of the Swift language.'

    app. Taking everything we''ve learned and more from the previous chapters'' recipes,
    this chapter will teach you how to get off the ground using Swift to build an
    iOS app.'

    introduces you to a totally different aspect of Swift programming: server-side
    programming with Swift. Also, you will gain an understanding of how to run Swift
    on Linux by installing the Swift toolchain. You will learn how to use a web server
    framework to build a REST API and how to host your API via a hosting service.
    You will also learn how to accomplish your tasks easily by understanding how to
    use Vapor, one of the most popular frameworks of Swift 5.'

    an understanding of how certain Swift types are implemented and their performance
    characteristics. Also, you will learn how to perform asynchronous tasks using
    the Grand Central Dispatch API. Then, we''ll explore the multi-threaded environment
    available on all Apple platforms and how to enhance the performance profile of
    your Swift constructs to build a fast and responsive app.'

    we''ll learn how to create iOS apps by exploring the declarative syntax used to
    achieve this. We''ll also explore how easy it is for SwiftUI and UIKit to work
    together. In addition to SwiftUI, we''ll also explore the basics of the new Combine
    framework and how this works alongside SwiftUI.'

    can use Swift code to harness machine learning techniques, as machine learning
    is becoming an increasingly hot topic. In this chapter, we''ll cover CoreML and
    the Vision frameworks, using pre-trained models to identify objects in real time.'
