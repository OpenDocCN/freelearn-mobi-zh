This book will help you minimize the impact of these errors in your Android project and increase your development productivity. It will show you the problems that are easily avoided, to help get you quickly to the testing stage.</p><p>
<em>Android Application Testing Guide</em> is the first and only book providing a practical introduction to the most commonly-available techniques, frameworks, and tools to improve the development of your Android applications. Clear, step-by-step instructions show how to write tests for your applications and assure quality control using various methodologies.</p><p>The author's experience in applying application testing techniques to real-world projects enables him to share insights on creating professional Android applications.</p><p>The book starts by introducing Test Driven Development, which is an agile component of the software development process and a technique where you will tackle bugs early on. From the most basic unit tests applied to a sample project to more sophisticated performance tests, this book provides a detailed description of the most widely used techniques in the Android testing world in a recipe-based approach.</p><p>The author has extensive experience of working on various development projects throughout his professional career. All this research and knowledge has helped create a book that will serve as a useful resource to any developer navigating the world of Android testing.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with Testing">Chapter 1</a>,<em> Getting Started with Testing</em> introduces the different types of testing and their applicability to software development projects in general and to Android in particular.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Testing on Android">Chapter 2</a>,<em> Testing on Android</em> covers testing on the Android platform, Unit testing and JUnit, creating an Android Test project, and running tests.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Building Blocks on the Android SDK">Chapter 3</a>,<em> Building Blocks on the Android SDK</em> starts digging a bit deeper to recognize the building blocks available to create the tests. It covers Assertions, TouchUtils, intended to test User Interfaces, Mock objects, Instrumentation, and TestCase class hierarchies featuring UML diagrams.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Test Driven Development">Chapter 4</a>,<em> Test Driven Development</em> introduces the Test Driven Development discipline. It starts with a general revision and later on moves to the concepts and techniques closely related to the Android platform. This is a code intensive chapter.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Android Testing Environment">Chapter 5</a>,<em> Android Testing Environment</em> provides different conditions to run the tests. It starts with the creation of the Android Virtual Devices (AVD) to provide different conditions and configurations for the application under test and runs the tests using the available options. Finally, it introduces monkey as a way to generate simulated events used for testing.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Behavior Driven Development">Chapter 6</a>,<em> Behavior Driven Development</em> introduces Behavior Driven Development and some concepts such as like the use of a common vocabulary to express the tests and the inclusion of business participants in the software development project.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Testing Recipes">Chapter 7</a>,<em> Testing Recipes</em> provides practical examples of different common situations you will encounter applying the disciplines and techniques described before. The examples are presented in a Cookbook style so you can adapt and use them for your projects. The recipes cover Android Unit tests, Activities, Applications, Databases and ContentProviders, Local and Remote Services, UIs, Exceptions, Parsers, and Memory leaks.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Continuous Integration">Chapter 8</a>,<em> Continuous Integration</em> introduces this agile technique for software engineering that aims to improve the software quality and to reduce the time taken to integrate changes by continuously applying integration and testing frequently.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Performance Testing and Profiling">Chapter 9</a>,<em> Performance Testing</em> introduces a series of concepts related to benchmarking and profiles from traditional logging statement methods to Creating Android performance tests and using profiling tools. This chapter also presents Caliper to create microbenchmarks.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Alternative Testing Tactics">Chapter 10</a>,<em> Alternative Testing Tactics</em> covers building Android from source, code coverage using EMMA, Robotium, testing on hosts, and Robolectric.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>First of all, you need practical Android development experience as we are not covering the basics. It is assumed that you already have some Android application or at least you are familiar with the topics described extensively in the Android Dev Guide (<a class="ulink" href="http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html">http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html</a>). Also it is very helpful having followed some of the Sample Code projects (<a class="ulink" href="http://developer.android.com/resources/browser.html?tag=sample">http://developer.android.com/resources/browser.html?tag=sample</a>), probably starting with API Demos and then moving to other more involved topics. This way you will get the most of this book.</p><p>To be able to follow the examples in the different chapters you need a common set of software and tools installed and several other components that are described in every chapter in particular including their respective download locations.</p><p>All the examples are based on:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS (lucid) 64 bit, fully updated</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Java SE version "1.6.0_24" (build 1.6.0_24-b07)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Android SDK tools, revision 11</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Android SDK Platform-tools, revision 4</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">SDK Platform Android 2.3.1, API 9, revision 2</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Android Compatibility package, revision 2</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, Version: Helios Service Release 1 (3.6.1)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Android Development Toolkit, Version: 10.0.1.v201103111512-110841</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Dalvik Debug Monitor Service, Version: 10.0.1.v201103111512-110841</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Apache Ant version 1.8.0 compiled on April 9 2010</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Git version 1.7.0.4</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Subversion version 1.6.6 (r40053) compiled Mar 23 2011, 13:08:34</li></ul></div><p>The UML diagrams presented in the book were created using BOUML release 4.21.</p><p>Screenshots were taken and edited using Shutter 0.86.3.</p><p>Manuscripts were edited using OpenOffice.org 3.2.1.</p></div>
