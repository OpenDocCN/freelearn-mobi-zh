No additional installations are required. All the features needed for making a game are right at your fingertips. You can create a simple game for iOS devices with just a single touch control, or you can create a full-fledged big-budget game for OS X. Your imagination is the limit.</p><p>Apple's new programming language Swift is at the heart of all this magic. Programming doesn't get easier than this. You don't have struggle between creating an interface and implementation for each class. Say goodbye to square brackets. And yet, it looks and feels like any other programming language so that you can hit the ground running. If you are coming from a JavaScript or ActionScript background, you will feel right at home. Even if you are proficient only in Objective-C, there is no need to worry as all the game development technologies work with both Objective-C and Swift.</p><p>With improved lighting and physics in SpriteKit, you don't have to write extra code to make your games come to life. Scenes in games will have proper lighting; all you have to do is provide the location of the light source. You can provide a normal map, which will caste shadows depending on the direction of the light source. With tools such as Glyph Designer, Texture Packer, and Spine, you can really make your game shine and stand out, technically and visually.</p><p>SceneKit is finally here on iOS devices. So now you can create 3D games with ease. You can also create texture geometries, camera, and lighting right in code. You can even import COLLADA files of scenes made in your favorite 3D package into SceneKit and see them running without adding any extra code. With SceneKit's inbuilt physics and collision system, you can make your game dynamic. The coolest thing is that you can also add a SpriteKit layer for the 2D GUI and the button interface.</p><p>If all that wasn't enough, Apple has also introduced Metal, a new graphics library developed only for Apple devices. Developed from the ground up, it greatly reduces the size of the overhead and brings the code much closer to the GPU so that you can add more stuff onto the screen and still maintain a smooth 60 Hz frame rate. At the same time, Apple gives you the freedom to develop games using OpenGLES as well.</p><p>Seeing that we have our work cut down for us, let's dive right into learning Swift, SpriteKit, SceneKit, and Metal.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started</em></span>, shows you how to download Xcode and create an iOS Developer account. You also get an overview of Swift, Playground, SpriteKit, SceneKit, and Metal, and a basic understanding of a graphics pipeline.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Swift Basics">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Swift Basics</em></span>, covers the basics of Swift, including a look at different data types, statements, arrays, dictionaries, functions, classes, and optionals.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. An Introduction to Xcode">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>An Introduction to Xcode</em></span>, demonstrates the different types of applications you can create with Xcode.<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>You also get a general understanding of the interface of Xcode and get to learn how to run an app on the device.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. SpriteKit Basics">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>SpriteKit Basics</em></span>, explains the creation of a basic game in SpriteKit, while you understand the basic elements of SpriteKit, such as sprites, scenes, and labels. We also create a basic physics engine and add collision detection and scoring.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Animation and Particles">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Animation and Particles</em></span>, illustrates the addition of animation and particle effects in the game using SpriteKit's inbuilt animation and particle system.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Audio and Parallax Effect">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Audio and Parallax Effect</em></span>, covers the addition of background music and sound effects to the game. We also add a parallax effect to the game to make it more dynamic.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Advanced SpriteKit">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced SpriteKit</em></span>, teaches you about the advanced features in SpriteKit, such as adding lighting and physics to your game. Additionally, it teaches you how to integrate Objective-C classes with Swift to implement tools such as Glyph Designer and Spine.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. SceneKit">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>SceneKit</em></span>, shows the creation of a basic 3D game in SceneKit. This chapter teaches you how to add objects such as geometries, lighting, and cameras to the game scene. You also get to import COLLADA files into the scene and integrate the SpriteKit interface to add the GUI and the button interface.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Metal">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Metal</em></span>, contains an in-depth look at Metal's graphics pipeline and shaders. It also teaches you how to get access the device, create vertex and texture buffers, and draw an image on the screen.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Publishing and Distribution">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Publishing and Distribution</em></span>,<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>prepares your app for distribution. You also get to create an app on iTunesConnect, and this chapter shows you how to publish your app on the iOS App Store. Additionally, it shows you how to create an ad hoc build and run it on any registered device.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You will need the latest version of Xcode 6 and A Mac running OS X Yosemite, or at least Maverick version 10.9.4. Although a simulator is included with Xcode, it is better to get an iOS device running iOS 8. For running Metal, a device with the A7 chip or higher is mandatory, as it won't run on a simulator.</p></div>
