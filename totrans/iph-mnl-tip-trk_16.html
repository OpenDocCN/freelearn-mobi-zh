			<p>When you're in an unfamiliar neighborhood, you may not know where you are or how to get to where you want to go. Even if you're in a familiar part of town, you may not know how to get to certain places, such as stores, parks, or buildings. To help you get around, you need a map.</p>
			<p>Of course, paper maps quickly go out of date, so a far better solution is to use the Maps app on your iPhone. Not only can the Maps app accurately map your location as long as you have a cellular phone or Wi-Fi connection, but it can provide directions in major cities around the world.</p>
			<p>With your iPhone and the Maps app, you'll never risk getting lost again, whether you're looking for a new place near your home or trying to navigate an unfamiliar part of the world.</p>
			<p>The topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Customizing the Maps app</li>
				<li>Getting directions</li>
				<li>Searching around you</li>
				<li>Creating favorite locations</li>
				<li>Placing markers on a map</li>
				<li>Using the compass</li>
				<li>Changing the appearance of a map</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Before you<a id="_idIndexMarker943"/> start using the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app, you might want to customize it, such as changing whether it displays distances in miles or kilometers, and whether to make driving or transit the default transportation type displayed.</p>
			<p>To customize the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Scroll down and tap <strong class="bold">Maps</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> screen displays various settings you can select, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.1</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer430"><img alt="Figure 16.1 – Settings to customize the Maps app&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.1 – Settings to customize the Maps app</p></li>
				<li>Scroll down and<a id="_idIndexMarker944"/> choose any options you wish, such as setting distances to miles or kilometers, or changing the default transportation type from driving to transit.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Navigation &amp; Guidance</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Navigation &amp; Guidance</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.2</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer431"><img alt="Figure 16.2 – Settings to customize the Maps app&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.2 – Settings to customize the Maps app</p></li>
				<li>Tap any further options, such<a id="_idIndexMarker945"/> as adjusting the volume for hearing directions.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Back</strong> button in the upper-left corner of the screen to return to the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> screen.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've customized the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app with the options you like, you can start using <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> to get directions to where you want to go.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-275"><a id="_idTextAnchor583"/>Getting directions</h1>
			<p>No matter where<a id="_idIndexMarker946"/> you are, you can't get to a new location until you know where you're at right now. To get acquainted with the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app on the Home Screen. A blue dot will highlight your current location, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.3</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer432"><img alt=" Figure 16.3 – A blue dot highlights your current location&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.03_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"> Figure 16.3 – A blue dot highlights your current location</p></li>

				<li>Type a place or <a id="_idIndexMarker948"/>street address and tap the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> button in the bottom-right corner of the virtual keyboard. Your search result appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.7</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer436"><img alt=" Figure 16.7 – Viewing search results&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.07_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"> Figure 16.7 – Viewing search results</p></li>
				<li>(Optional:) Tap<a id="_idIndexMarker949"/> a location (if you searched for a type of place, such as a gas station or restaurant). The <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app displays your chosen location in more detail with a <strong class="bold">Directions</strong> button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.8</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer437"><img alt=" Figure 16.8 – The Directions button&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.08_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"> Figure 16.8 – The Directions button</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Directions</strong> button.

			<p class="figure-caption"> Figure 16.11 – Directions appear as you travel to your destination</p>
			<p>Sometimes you may want to go <a id="_idIndexMarker953"/>somewhere but stop at places along the way to pick up food or buy gas for your car. Rather than create two separate destinations, you can simply create a detour while heading toward your final destination.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-276"><a id="_idTextAnchor584"/>Adding a detour </h2>
			<p>When you're traveling toward <a id="_idIndexMarker954"/>your destination, you might want to stop along the way to get gas (if you're driving) or get something to eat. The <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app will then show you the nearest options so you can pick one and get directions to that destination before heading on to your final destination.</p>
			<p>To add a detour, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Follow the steps in the <em class="italic">Getting directions</em> section to start traveling toward a chosen destination. The <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app displays a sheet at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.12</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer441"><img alt="Figure 16.12 – The sheet at the bottom of the screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.12 – The sheet at the bottom of the screen</p></li>

				<li>Tap a detour<a id="_idIndexMarker955"/> destination, such as <strong class="bold">Gas Stations</strong> or <strong class="bold">Coffee</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app displays a list of options.</li>
				<li>Tap an option. The <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app will now give directions to your detour. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app gives you directions as you arrive at intersections or places where there are multiple directions in which you can go. Fortunately, you can see a complete list of instructions, so you know in advance where you need to go.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-277"><a id="_idTextAnchor585"/>Viewing a list of instructions</h2>
			<p>As you travel, the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app will show and tell<a id="_idIndexMarker956"/> you where to go next. However, you may want to view a list of all the instructions. To view a list of instructions, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Follow the steps in the <em class="italic">Getting directions</em> section to start traveling toward a chosen destination. </li>
				<li>Swipe up the handle to reveal the entire sheet at the bottom of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 16.13</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> icon. A list of instructions appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.14</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer443"><img alt="Figure 16.14 – A list of traveling directions&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.14 – A list of traveling directions</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong> when you're finished<a id="_idIndexMarker957"/> viewing the list of instructions.<a id="_idTextAnchor586"/><a id="_idTextAnchor587"/></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sometimes, you might be in a part of town and just want to know what's around you so you can decide which direction you want to go in. In that case, the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app can show you what's around you, so you can choose from those nearby options which way to go.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-278"><a id="_idTextAnchor588"/>Searching around you</h1>
			<p>If you're in an unfamiliar <a id="_idIndexMarker958"/>area, you may not know where you want to go, but you may know you want to go to a restaurant, coffeehouse, or a supermarket. Rather than search for a specific location, you can ask the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app to show you what's around you.</p>
			<p>To find what's around you, follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Tap in the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> text field. A list of recent searches along with a list of nearby places appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.15</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer444"><img alt="Figure 16.15 – A list of nearby places&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.15 – A list of nearby places</p></li>
				<li>Tap the type of <a id="_idIndexMarker959"/>place you want to find, such as <strong class="bold">Groceries or Fast Food</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app displays a list of options, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.16</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer445"><img alt="Figure 16.16 – Displaying a list of options for the category you chose&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.16_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.16 – Displaying a list of options for the category you chose</p></li>
				<li>Tap on a specific place. The <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app displays a <strong class="bold">Directions</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Tap this <strong class="bold">Directions</strong> button and <a id="_idIndexMarker960"/>choose a travel option, such as <strong class="screen-inline">Driving</strong> or <strong class="screen-inline">Transit</strong>, to see your route.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In many cases, you'll tend to visit the same places over and over again. Rather than keep searching for them, you might prefer to store your favorite places in a list that you can then access quickly without searching for it again. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-279"><a id="_idTextAnchor589"/>Creating favorite locations</h1>
			<p>You likely have a<a id="_idIndexMarker961"/> favorite restaurant, nightclub, gas station, and supermarket. To <a id="_idIndexMarker962"/>make it easy to find your favorite locations, you can save them in a list. That way, when you want to visit one of your favorite locations, you can get directions with a minimal amount of searching.</p>
			<p>The first step is to find your favorite location and then save it in your favorites list. Once you've done that, you can then open this favorites list and get directions to a specific location with one tap.</p>
			<p>To save a location in your favorite list, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Search for a location that you want to save as a favorite until you see a blue <strong class="bold">Directions</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Swipe up on the handle near the bottom of the screen to reveal the entire list of options, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.17</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer446"><img alt="Figure 16.17 – Revealing the Save to... button&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.17 – Revealing the Save to... button</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Save to...</strong> button. A list of collections appears. If you have not created a guide yet, a <strong class="bold">New Guide...</strong> button appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.18</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer447"><img alt="Figure 16.18 – Adding a location to a collection&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.18 – Adding a location to a collection</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">New Guide</strong> button.

				<li>Type a descriptive name for your guide and then tap <strong class="bold">Create</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've <a id="_idIndexMarker963"/>created a guide and added at least one item to that guide, you can access that favorite location at any time.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-280"><a id="_idTextAnchor590"/>Using a guide</h2>
			<p>Once you've stored one or more locations in a collection, you can open that collection at any time to access your list of stored locations.</p>
			<p>To get directions to<a id="_idIndexMarker964"/> a favorite location, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Swipe up on the handle near the bottom of the screen to reveal a complete list of options. The <strong class="bold">Guide</strong> category lists all the named guides you have created, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.20</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer449"><img alt="Figure 16.20 – A list of saved collections&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.20_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.20 – A list of saved collections</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the guide name you<a id="_idIndexMarker965"/> want to open. A list of saved locations appears inside that collection.</li>
				<li>Tap on a location to display the blue <strong class="bold">Directions</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Directions</strong> button to get directions to your favorite location.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>No matter how much you like a location, eventually you may want to delete either that single location or an entire collection storing your favorite locations. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-281"><a id="_idTextAnchor591"/>Deleting a location in a guide</h2>
			<p>You can delete an entire guide (along with any locations stored inside that guide), or just delete an individual location within a guide.</p>
			<p>To delete an entire guide or just <a id="_idIndexMarker966"/>one location in a guide, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Swipe up on the handle near the bottom of the screen to reveal a complete list of options. The Guide category lists all the named collections you have created (see <em class="italic">Figure 16.20</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap a guide. A list of favorite locations stored in that guide appears.</li>
				<li>Swipe left on any stored location. A <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> button appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.21</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer450"><img alt="Figure 16.21 – The Remove button&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.21_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.21 – The Remove button</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Remove</strong>. (If you tap the <strong class="bold">Share</strong> button, you'll be able to send that location information to someone by email, text messaging, or AirDrop.) </li>
			</ol>
			<p>In case you want to delete an entire guide instead of a single location, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Swipe up on the handle near the bottom of the screen to reveal a complete list of options. The Guide category lists all the named guides you have created (see <em class="italic">Figure 16.20</em>).</li>
				<li>Swipe left on a collection name to display the <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Remove</strong>. A message appears at the bottom of the screen, asking for you to verify that you want to delete an entire collection.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To help you navigate around, you<a id="_idIndexMarker967"/> might also want to add markers on a map to identify specific areas of interest.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-282"><a id="_idTextAnchor592"/>Placing markers on a map</h1>
			<p>On a paper map, you <a id="_idIndexMarker968"/>might scribble some notes to highlight an area of particular importance, such as someone's house or a favorite area to go hiking. With the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app, you can also add markers to highlight any area you wish.</p>
			<p>By creating a marker, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker969"/> identify a place and either save that location so you can find it easily again, or share that location with others so they can find it as well.</p>
			<p>To place a marker on a map, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Press and hold a fingertip on the screen where you want to place a marker. A marker appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.22</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer451"><img alt="Figure 16.22 – Placing a marker&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.22_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.22 – Placing a marker</p></li>
				<li>Tap<a id="_idIndexMarker970"/> the <strong class="bold">Edit Location</strong> button. An <a id="_idIndexMarker971"/><strong class="bold">Edit Location</strong> screen appears, letting you place your marker more precisely, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.23</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer452"><img alt="Figure 16.23 – Placing a marker&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.23_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.23 – Placing a marker</p></li>
				<li>Slide and pinch the<a id="_idIndexMarker972"/> screen to precisely place the marker over a specific area and then tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. </li>
				<li>Slide the handle up to<a id="_idIndexMarker973"/> display a <strong class="bold">Marked Location</strong> screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.24</em>. At this point, you can tap the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button to store this in a guide or tap the <strong class="bold">Share</strong> button to share this location with another person. You can also tap <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> to remove the marker from the map: </li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.24 – The Marked Location screen</p>
			<p>Markers can help you<a id="_idIndexMarker974"/> customize a map, but sometimes you may not care about finding<a id="_idIndexMarker975"/> a specific location, but about traveling in a specific direction using a compass.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-283"><a id="_idTextAnchor593"/>Using the compass</h1>
			<p>If you're ever lost and <a id="_idIndexMarker976"/>need to travel in a specific direction, you can turn your iPhone into a compass. That way, you can see where you want to go and use the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app to show you how to keep heading in the direction you want to go.</p>
			<p>To see how to use a compass in the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Press two fingers on the screen and rotate the screen to show the compass in the upper-right corner of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.25</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer454"><img alt="Figure 16.25 – The compass in the Map app&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.25_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.25 – The compass in the Map app</p></li>
				<li>Tap the Compass icon to make it go away.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The compass can help <a id="_idIndexMarker977"/>you navigate in a particular direction. By default, the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app displays a cartoon version of an area, but you can switch this appearance to a more realistic satellite image instead.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-284"><a id="_idTextAnchor594"/>Changing the appearance of a map</h1>
			<p>To make it easy to <a id="_idIndexMarker978"/>see a map, the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app displays a cartoon representation of an area. However, you can also switch to a photo-realistic satellite view. </p>
			<p>To change the appearance of the map, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">I</strong> icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. A <strong class="bold">Maps Settings</strong> sheet appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.26</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer455"><img alt="Figure 16.26 – The Maps Setting screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.26_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.26 – The Maps Setting screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Transit</strong> tab to view the<a id="_idIndexMarker979"/> map, highlighting mass transit routes, or tap the <strong class="bold">Satellite</strong> tab to view a photo-realistic version of the map, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.27</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer456"><img alt="Figure 16.27 – The satellite view of a map&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_16.27_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 16.27 – The satellite view of a map</p></li>
				<li>Tap the close (<strong class="bold">X</strong>) icon in the <a id="_idIndexMarker980"/>upper-right corner of the sheet to make it go away.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>At any time, you can repeat the aforementioned steps to switch back to another version of the map, depending on what y<a id="_idTextAnchor595"/>ou prefer. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-285"><a id="_idTextAnchor596"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>The Maps app can be useful, whether you're traveling in an unfamiliar area or even in your own neighborhood, because it can show you the fastest route to a specific destination.
