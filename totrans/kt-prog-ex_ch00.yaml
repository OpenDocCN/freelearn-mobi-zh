- en: Since its announcement as an officially supported language for Android, Kotlin
    has experienced a huge rise in popularity. This proliferation in popularity is
    in many ways warranted as Kotlin is a modern and extremely well-designed language,
    which has many domains of application—web, mobile, and native to name a few. As
    a direct consequence of its rise in popularity, Kotlin has experienced steady
    growth over the years.

    That being said, it was written primarily with beginners and experienced programmers
    who want to learn Kotlin in mind.

- en: Over the course of writing this book, I paid special attention to the fact that
    beginners will need to be eased into topics and concepts. As such, the chapters
    of this book were written in ascending order of difficulty. If you are a beginner,
    this will enable you to learn as quickly as possible with as few hiccups as possible.

- en: Fairly experienced readers are expected to move more quickly through this book
    than beginners—all things being equal. If you have prior experience of programming
    and application development, you may choose to first run through the code examples
    of this book to get a good feel for the topics covered and what to expect. Java
    developers in particular may be able to get away with diving right into the more
    advanced chapters of the book.
