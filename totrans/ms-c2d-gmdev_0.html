You will discover that your games are just a few steps away from becoming the best games possible.</p><p>You'll be guided through a project and see what makes a game stand out when hundreds, or even thousands, of similar games fail to make any lasting impact. You'll experience the simplicity of Cocos2d, Chipmunk, OALSimpleAudio, and much more. You'll be given code for some unique game mechanics that will make your game stand out from the masses. This book ensures that no matter what scale of game you're working on is—whether it is indie or for a large publisher—you'll get the skills you need to create a highly polished and enjoyable experience for your players.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
