So, what <a id="id419" class="calibre1"/>of the future of iOS game development? Obviously, nobody can tell what the future will bring, but we can guess a few possibilities based on the recent evolution of the iOS/Xcode platform, programming, and how game development as a whole will change.</p></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch08lvl1sec53" class="calibre1"/>A greater focus on functional programming</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">As of this <a id="id420" class="calibre1"/>publication, the Swift programming<a id="id421" class="calibre1"/> language is only a year old but it represents a recent paradigm shift in much of programming. Object-oriented programming and design still holds true, but a shift to functional programming is where languages such as Scala and Swift place their focus. Functional programming, in summary, is a focus on functions being pure mathematical calculations of objects with an avoidance of the state changes and mutable data that we've seen with past languages, such as C++/Java and even Apple's own Objective-C. Instead of dealing with subroutines, a function only works on the parameters it's given. Swift does this well with its closures, which we've seen a few times in this book, and are often used to compact much of the logic in game programming for iOS.</p><p class="calibre8">Since <em class="calibre10">WWDC14</em>, Apple has told developers that Swift is the successor to both C and Objective-C. It's a completely rebuilt language from the ground up with speed and efficiency as its focus, something game developers must always take advantage of and why Swift is now the language of choice going forward for iOS game development. Objective-C is not going away, and Swift still has some growing up to do before it can even take over all of what Objective-C can do for iOS development. Swift's 2.0 update from iOS 9 added more for error catching and debugging with keywords, such as throw, catch, and guard. Thankfully, we don't have to abandon any past Objective-C projects since the ability to use both Swift and Objective-C in the same project is very simple through the use of an Objective-C/Swift Bridging file. </p><p class="calibre8">As we move on to future versions of iOS, expect more debugging controls and improvements to Swift's ability to compact detailed logic into a few lines. Some data sorting functionalities of Swift are faster than Objective-C, and in<a id="id422" class="calibre1"/> the world of game development, any gains in frame rate is always a good thing. Despite the advances in CPU/GPU power and the ever-growing ease of game development frameworks, such as SpriteKit and SceneKit, the design aspect of game design can be a <a id="id423" class="calibre1"/>double-edged sword if we forget the engineering aspect of this craft. Some of the tools given to us in the recent game development scene can make almost anybody a game developer. This is a good thing. We want people from all walks of life to be game developers, but we must not let some of the recent and future tools that allow games on iOS or other platforms making us lazy and forget that there is and always will be a programming/engineering side to this industry. The frameworks and visual tools of iOS and other game engines should always be treated as tools and never as a crutch. The best games of the past, present, and in the future will be games that tap into every aspect of game development, particularly, the hardest aspects of game development, such as the graphics pipeline. That's why Apple tapped into the details of the GPU with the Metal API.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch08lvl1sec54" class="calibre1"/>The Apple Watch</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">As of iOS 9, the <a id="id424" class="calibre1"/>Apple Watch's platform already got an upgrade with <a id="id425" class="calibre1"/>watchOS 2. The Apple Watch is generally, at the moment, not a video game platform. Without taking the small screen size into play, apps made for the Apple Watch don't have much in the way of making game-like graphics updates. In the future, this might change. At the moment, apps made in watchOS are like child apps of main iOS apps. Eventually, we can make watchOS apps separately without having them attached to a parent iOS project. However, some developers have made simple text-based games for the Apple watch. It's possible that in the future, we could make more action-oriented games for the Apple Watch. </p><p class="calibre8">Currently, it's very much possible to make a game that uses the watch for accessories data, such as inventory, maps, and more with a little bit of ingenuity. One feature of the Apple Watch that we could design games or game controls with is <a id="id426" class="calibre1"/><strong class="calibre9">Force Touch</strong>. Force Touch senses how firm the press gesture is. This isn't something new to game design as a whole but new to iOS with the next line of iPhones and iPads most likely having this feature as well. Getting the strength of a player's touch and taps could allow some intuitive gameplay mechanics for the next line of mobile games.</p><p class="calibre8">For more on the watchOS to possibly inspire some game development ideas for the device, check out the<a id="id427" class="calibre1"/> watchOS 2 preview page at <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.apple.com/watchos-2-preview/">https://www.apple.com/watchos-2-preview/</a>.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch08lvl1sec55" class="calibre1"/>Component-based structuring</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">We<a id="id428" class="calibre1"/> saw in the previous chapters that iOS has imparted much of the component-based structuring paradigm to tackle the unique <a id="id429" class="calibre1"/>software/programming requirements that come from game development. Instead of building a tall parent-child structure that we see from an object-oriented design, it builds a structure that does best by growing it's structure in width. Classes, such as <code class="email">GKEntity</code>, <code class="email">GKComponent</code>, and other aspects of <code class="email">GameplayKit</code>, are what let us take advantage of these features. This type of structuring isn't all too new in game development. Component-based structuring has been used by multiplatform game engines, such as Unity and Unreal Engine, and continues to be the way game developers like us make and reuse parts of our games. Expect the future updates to Xcode and iOS to utilize these features even more. In the near future, we will probably see Xcode look and act even more like these game engines but with the benefit of being specifically made for the iOS devices, allowing even deeper, custom integration. Doing all of this directly in Xcode and with iOS frameworks allows instant access to Apple features without the use of paid asset tools or waiting for plugin updates. Developers for the next generation of iOS games will be able to take AI actions, character abilities, HUD animations, and other features made in one game and reuse them almost instantly for a completely different game. Component-based structuring makes it where the developer can build a library of reusable features by placing the design of our games ahead of typical development hurdles.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch08lvl1sec56" class="calibre1"/>The rise of VR</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">This <a id="id430" class="calibre1"/>has been a topic that Apple has been rather quiet about where other platforms have been rather vocal. Even the manufacturers <a id="id431" class="calibre1"/>of Apple's A7/A8 chips, Samsung, have joined the VR development environment with their GearVR device and their partnership with Oculus on the project. Google has created the simple Cardboard setup, akin to the GearVR, which simply lets the user place their smartphone into the device or box to experience VR experiences and games. Most famously, there is the Oculus Rift, which will have its consumer model available in the first quarter of 2016, and will likely be the front runner in this newer game environment.</p><p class="calibre8">Virtual reality is a topic that has come up a number of times in the past few decades. It has come and gone, but for the time being, it seems to be getting its overdue foothold in technology. The Unity game engine, for example, just recently allowed for native support of VR. The thought process in making these games is a bit different and has yet to be fully fleshed out. It is possible that soon Apple will throw their hat into this arena. If you haven't already, learning how to make fun games in the VR space might be a worthy act of foresight.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch08lvl1sec57" class="calibre1"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">We hope that the discussions and tutorials seen throughout this book helped you either learn the platform for the first time or enriched what you might have already known about iOS. We hope that you take this knowledge and make some amazing games for the iOS family of devices and continue to learn more about the platform and game development as a whole.</p><p class="calibre8">In the end, always remember that game design and programming is a combination of computer science, engineering, art, and lots of hard work. It's a complex creative field that is a combination of every other creative profession from music to movie making, to 2D animation, 3D sculpting, and more. As the case with other creative fields, developers should never feel <em class="calibre10">done</em> and always be humble in what they know and acknowledge that there's always more to learn in this ever-growing field. Like a videogame, be up for the challenge. Realize when you look back that you essentially leveled up from what you used to know and there are always more abilities to gain.</p></div></body></html>
