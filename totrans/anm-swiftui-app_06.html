<h1 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Animating a Girl on a Swing</h1>
<p>Welcome to the next project. In this one, we’re going to animate parts of an image, specifically an image of a girl on a swing, and make those individual parts move with a natural motion.</p>
<p>To do this, we’re going to take a look at an animating technique that uses any image or vector file of a subject and then cuts that image up into various parts in order to animate them separately. We will also take a look at a new modifier called <code>mask</code>, which is used for setting the opacity of a view.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at what we will learn in this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathering and slicing images</li>
<li>Adding animating variables</li>
<li>Adding images to the scene</li>
<li>Using the <code>mask</code> modifier</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>You can download the resources and the finished project from the <code>Chapter 6</code> folder on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Animating-SwiftUI-Applications">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Animating-SwiftUI-Applications</a>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Gathering and slicing images</h1>
<p>In this project, I will be <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>using some simple graphics, including an image of a girl, a leafy<a id="_idIndexMarker322"/> background, and a branch. And, as I mentioned, we will be animating two parts of the scene: the swing and the girl’s legs.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is download the images as explained in the <em class="italic">Technical requirements</em> section and then cut the images into various parts. To do this, I will simply use Mac’s Preview app, which is a free app that’s already installed on your Mac computer. Inside this app, there is an option called <strong class="bold">Markup</strong>, as shown here:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.1: Accessing the Markup tools " src="img/B18674_06_01.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.1: Accessing the Markup tools</p>
<p>Clicking on <strong class="bold">Markup</strong> will open up an array of helpful editing tools that we can use to transform an image in unique <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>ways. One of the best tools for cutting images is the <strong class="bold">Lasso Selection</strong> tool, which lets us draw a selection box around some or all of the parts of the<a id="_idIndexMarker324"/> image, and either cut it out or copy it to another window. You can find the tool in the drop-down menu located here:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.2: Accessing the Lasso Selection tool " src="img/B18674_06_02.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.2: Accessing the Lasso Selection tool</p>
<p>To use it, click and drag your cursor around any object, and then connect the start and end points when you’re done. We want to drag the lasso around the girl’s lower legs, just above the knee joint, like so:</p>

<p>With the legs selected <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>using the <code>leg</code>. Your image will look something like this:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.4: Separating the leg with the Lasso Selection tool</p>
<p>This image is okay, but there’s a problem. The image contains a background that won’t look good in the scene; we only want the leg without any background. The best way I have found to remove backgrounds is to use a helpful free online tool called <strong class="bold">removebg</strong>, which you can access here: <a href="https://www.remove.bg/upload">https://www.remove.bg/upload</a>. Simply drop the image onto that website, and it identifies the background and removes it.</p>
<p>At this point, we now<a id="_idIndexMarker327"/> have our image of a leg (though our animation includes<a id="_idIndexMarker328"/> two legs, one image will work just fine to represent both legs of the girl).</p>
<p>Next in our project, we also want a piece of rope, which we will use to tie the swing to the tree in our background image. However, if you look at <em class="italic">Figure 6</em><em class="italic">.3</em>, the rope is a little too short for what we need. To get an extra piece of rope, I used the <strong class="bold">Lasso Selection</strong> tool around the rope, copied it, and made a new image, then removed the background with <strong class="bold">removebg</strong> (as we did with the leg). <em class="italic">Figure 6</em><em class="italic">.5</em> is the result; this is what we will use in the scene to extend the existing rope:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.5: Rope " src="img/B18674_06_05.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.5: Rope</p>
<p>Next, I looked for a suitable background, which was a tree with some grass and a sky. Here is the one we will <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>use (it originally had a tire swing; however, I didn’t want that kind of <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>swing, so I removed it using some other software called Affinity Photo). Now we have a tree and we can tie a swing to its branch:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.6: Our background image " src="img/B18674_06_06.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.6: Our background image</p>

<p>I also thought the<a id="_idIndexMarker331"/> tree was a little sparse, so I found some leaves that can <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>be positioned onto the branch later, and they will also hide the top part of the rope:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.7: Our leaves image " src="img/B18674_06_07.jpg"/>

<p>As you play around with slicing up images and making the individual parts to animate, you may find that you want something better than Mac’s Preview app. You may also find that, even though <strong class="bold">removebg</strong> works in most cases, it may not work in every instance. If so, you can use professional software such as Photoshop; however, that can be expensive. Instead, you <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>can try my favorite image editing software that I mentioned<a id="_idIndexMarker334"/> earlier, Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo. They are very reasonably priced and as robust as Photoshop, but they are much more user-friendly. Definitely take a look at them if you want to learn how to manipulate images that you can use in an iOS app without paying a yearly subscription, as you would for Photoshop.</p>
<p>Once we have all the parts we need for the girl in the swing scene, we can start assembling it in Xcode. So, create a new project – I have called mine <code>Girl On A Swing</code> – then open the Assets catalog and drop all the images inside as we have done before.</p>
<p>Now we can start coding in the <code>ContentView</code> file; this is the only file we need for this project as there is very little code required to make this project work.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Adding the animating variables</h1>
<p>As we have done before, we start off by adding the properties needed to keep track of the different parts <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>we want to animate. In our case, we need three properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>One property for the girl image, aptly called <code>girl</code></li>
<li>One for the left leg, called <code>leftLeg</code></li>
<li>One for the right leg, called <code>rightLeg</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though we are using one image for both the right and left legs, we still need two separate leg properties for the animation to work because the legs will be moving at different times and speeds.</p>
<p>All of these properties will be <code>State</code> properties, so they will update the view instantly as their values change. Put the following code into the <code>ContentView</code> file, just above the <code>body</code> property:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
    @State private var girl = false
    @State private var leftLeg = false
    @State private var rightLeg = false</pre>
<p>As usual, all the properties are all set to <code>false</code> so the animation won’t start until they are changed to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>We’re also going to add a fourth property, which I’m calling <code>fadeOutRope</code>. This isn’t strictly necessary, but it gives me an opportunity to show you how to use the <code>mask</code> modifier, which masks a view by changing its opacity; if we pass in a gradient color, we can make the rope fade out as it reaches the tree branch. Here is the property I want you to add under the previous ones:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
let fadeOutRope = Gradient(colors: [.clear, .black])</pre>
<p>The <code>Gradient</code> function needs an array of colors to work, so I gave it two colors: a <code>clear</code> color (or non-color), and a <code>black</code> color. These two colors will be blended together into the rope image, making the top portion fade out. As I said, this is not strictly necessary; however, I think it’s better to fade out the top of the rope because it’s not tied to the branch of the tree in the image we are using, so we want to blend it in a little bit, giving the appearance that it is attached somewhere in the tree. Later, we will use the <code>mask</code> modifier, add<a id="_idIndexMarker336"/> an image of some leaves to help conceal the top of the rope, and make the scene look even more natural.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Adding the images to the scene</h1>
<p>There are four images we<a id="_idIndexMarker337"/> need to add to our scene, which we will add in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The background</li>
<li>The right leg</li>
<li>The girl</li>
<li>The left leg</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Adding the background</h2>
<p>We’ll add the <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>background inside a <code>ZStack</code>, this will be the first view in the file, and so all subsequent views will be placed on top of this. Here is the code you need:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Image("tree").resizable()
                .frame(width: 550, height: 900)
               }
            }</pre>
<p>In <code>ZStack</code>, we call the <code>Image</code> initializer and pass in the <code>tree</code> string. Next, we use the <code>resizable</code> modifier to resize the tree, and then set the <code>frame</code> of the background to a width of <code>550</code> and a height of <code>900</code> so the background image can extend to the edges of an iPhone of any size.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Adding the right leg</h2>
<p>When it comes to adding the <code>rightleg</code>, <code>leftleg</code>, and <code>girl</code> properties, we need another <code>ZStack</code> so we can layer all of the views on top of each other, then use the <code>offset</code> modifier to move<a id="_idIndexMarker339"/> them into place as needed.</p>
<p>To add the right leg to the scene, enter the following code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
 ZStack {
    ///right leg
    Image("leg").resizable().aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
        .rotationEffect(.degrees(rightLeg ? -20 : 50),
          anchor: .topTrailing )
        .scaleEffect(0.12)
        .offset(x: -448, y: 92)
        .animation(Animation.easeInOut(duration: 
          1).delay(0.09).repeatForever(autoreverses: true),
          value: rightLeg)
        .onAppear() {
            rightLeg.toggle()
        }
     }</pre>
<p>First, the <code>Image</code> initializer gets passed into it the name of the image we want to display; here, it’s <code>"leg"</code>. Remember, we are using this one image to represent the right and left legs (we can get away with using a single image because this is a 2D scene; we don’t have a 3D view around the image, so we can’t really see any variance in each leg).</p>
<p>Next, we will use the <code>resizable</code> modifier and set the aspect ratio to <code>fit</code>. Using the <code>fit</code> option resizes the image content to use all the available screen space, both vertically and horizontally.</p>
<p>The next line of code sets the <code>rotationEffect</code> on the leg. The right leg will be rotated by <code>-20</code> degrees when the <code>rightLeg</code> property is <code>true</code>, and it will rotate <code>50</code> degrees when it is <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Notice the <code>anchor</code> parameter too? An anchor point is the point around which the image will rotate. When thinking<a id="_idIndexMarker340"/> about humans (and animals too), our anchor points are our joints. We bend and move from those joints, our pivot points. In our project, by using the <code>topTrailing</code> option, the leg will rotate about the knee joint.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">If you type a dot (<code>.</code>) into your code, you can see the other options Xcode offers for your anchor point.</p>
<p>After that, we need to scale the image down to a usable size. As it is, it’s too big for the screen, so by using the <code>scaleEffect</code> modifier, we have scaled it down to 12 percent of its original size. For our scene, that’s a nice fit.</p>
<p>The next line of code uses the <code>offset</code> modifier to place the right leg in the exact location we need. It needs to be placed at the knee joint of the girl image, which I worked out to be a value of -448 for the <em class="italic">x</em>-axis and 92 for the <em class="italic">y</em>-axis. Arriving at those coordinates is really just a matter of trial and error. For example, if you want to move the part up on the screen, add a smaller number for the <em class="italic">y</em> position, and if you want to move the image to right, add a larger number for the <em class="italic">x</em> position.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to the animation, most of which we have seen before. Here, the <code>animation</code> modifier does the work of moving the leg, with a <code>duration</code> of 1 second, which is the time it takes for the animation to finish. Also, using a slight <code>delay</code> of <code>.09</code> seconds will give a more random look to the animation as we will set the left leg to a different delay.</p>
<p>As well as this, we want the animation to repeat forever, or at least until the user stops the app, so that’s why the <code>repeatForever</code> function is used. The <code>autoReverse</code> parameter has a value of <code>true</code> because we want the animation to go forward in one direction, finish, reverse itself, and continue in the opposite direction. Also, the <code>animation</code> modifier needs a property for its <code>value</code> parameter, and for that, we pass the <code>rightLeg</code> property into it.</p>
<p>The final part of this code is the <code>onAppear</code> modifier. This modifier is used to run code when the view appears on the screen, hence the name <code>onAppear</code>. In <code>body</code>, we toggle the <code>rightLeg</code> property to <code>true</code> to activate the animation.</p>
<p>Now, having a leg on the <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>screen that is animating back and forth is not really the look we are going for, so let’s add the girl now, followed by the left leg.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Adding the girl</h2>
<p>To add the girl to<a id="_idIndexMarker342"/> the scene, enter the following code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
 Image("Girl").resizable().aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
                .scaleEffect(0.25)
                .offset(x: -300, y: 0)</pre>
<p>This is similar code to adding the leg: we used the <code>Image</code> initializer, passed in the <code>Girl</code> image, made it <code>resizable</code>, and set its <code>aspectRatio</code> to <code>fit</code>. Then we only needed two more modifiers to finish this image off: <code>scaleEffect</code>, which will scale the image down to fit in the scene, and <code>offset</code> to place the girl image in the correct position on the <em class="italic">x</em>-and <em class="italic">y</em>-axes (using values of <code>-300</code> for <code>x</code> and <code>0</code> for <code>y</code> will place the girl in about the middle of the screen).</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Adding the left leg</h2>
<p>Finally, to <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>complete the girl image, she needs a left leg:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
///left leg
    Image("leg").resizable().aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
        .rotationEffect(.degrees(leftLeg ? -45 : 30),
          anchor: .topTrailing)
        .scaleEffect(0.12)
        .offset(x: -455, y: 90)
        .animation(Animation.easeInOut(duration:
          0.4).delay(1).repeatForever(autoreverses: true),
          value: leftLeg)
        .onAppear() {
            leftLeg.toggle()
        }</pre>
<p>The code for this left leg is pretty much the same as for the right leg, but we used the <code>leftLeg</code> property and changed some values. For example, the <code>duration</code> property for this leg is <code>0.4</code> and the <code>delay</code> property is <code>1</code> second. As I mentioned earlier, by adding different durations and delays<a id="_idIndexMarker344"/> from the other images, we can randomize the swinging effect a little bit so that the legs don’t both go up and down together. This will give the animation a more natural swinging motion.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Bringing the images together</h2>
<p>With this code in place, we have<a id="_idIndexMarker345"/> finished piecing together the girl in the swing scene, but if you look at the preview, it only shows the background so far:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.8: Our animation with just the background " src="img/B18674_06_08.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.8: Our animation with just the background</p>
<p>Where are the two legs and the girl that we just coded? Well, it’s all there, but it’s just not positioned over the <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>background yet; it’s all off to the side of the screen. This is because we positioned the legs in relation to the girl, but we didn’t position the completed image in relation to the background scene. To do that, let’s come out of the second <code>ZStack</code> brace and add the following code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
        .offset(x: 25, y: 0)
        .rotationEffect(.degrees(girl ? -30 : -45), anchor:
          .top)
        .animation(Animation.easeInOut(duration:
          1).delay(0.09).repeatForever(autoreverses: true),
          value: girl)
     .onAppear() {
            girl.toggle()
        }</pre>
<p>This is what the code does:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first line offsets the completed <code>Girl</code> image a small amount so it’s centered. </li>
<li>The second line<a id="_idIndexMarker347"/> sets the rotation parameters for the completed image, meaning how far we want the girl to swing back and forth. If the <code>girl</code> property is <code>true</code>, the girl image will swing to the right (<code>-30</code>), and if it’s <code>false</code>, the image will swing to the left (<code>-45</code>); this creates the swinging animation. The anchor point is placed above the girl image; this is where we want the image to pivot from.</li>
<li>And the third line adds the animation to the completed image, with a <code>duration</code> value of <code>1</code> second and a slight <code>delay</code> of <code>0.09</code> seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>And with that code completed, you can now see the girl and the legs. However, there’s still a problem: the image of the girl and her legs looks too small, and the legs are not connected to the girl:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.9: Our animation with the image parts disconnected " src="img/B18674_06_09.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.9: Our animation with the image parts disconnected</p>
<p>To fix this, we need to <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>add one line of code just after the closing brace of the very first <code>ZStack</code>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
    .frame(width: 950, height: 900)</pre>
<p>This code sets the frame’s width and height of all the views inside the <code>ZStack</code> so it’s in proportion to the background. Here is the result:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.10: Our animation with the image parts (nearly) connected " src="img/B18674_06_10.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.10: Our animation with the image parts (nearly) connected</p>
<p>Go ahead and run the application to see what it does. There are three animations happening here; the<a id="_idIndexMarker349"/> girl is swinging back and forth, and each leg is separately kicking up and down, as shown here:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.11: The animation (with the parts nearly connected) " src="img/B18674_06_11.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.11: The animation (with the parts nearly connected)</p>
<p>Everything is now animating... but look at the top of the swing in <em class="italic">Figure 6</em><em class="italic">.11</em>. The rope ends in mid-air. Let’s use the rope and leaf images in the Assets catalog to fix this.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Using the mask modifier</h1>
<p>The rope is not attached to anything – how can we fix that? Well, it’s easy: by adding two rope pieces and<a id="_idIndexMarker350"/> using a <code>mask</code> modifier to help them gradually fade out <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>at the top.</p>
<p>Directly after the closing brace of the <code>onAppear</code> modifier for the left leg, add this code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
    //MARK: - ROPE
    ///right side rope masked
    Image("rope").resizable().aspectRatio(contentMode:
      .fit)
        .mask(LinearGradient(gradient: fadeOutRope,
          startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottom))
        .frame(width: 57, height: 80)
        .offset(x: -189, y: -100)
    ///left side rope masked
    Image("rope").resizable().aspectRatio(contentMode:
      .fit)
        .mask(LinearGradient(gradient: fadeOutRope,
          startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottom))
        .frame(width: 57, height: 80)
        .offset(x: -228, y: -108)</pre>
<p>We need two pieces of rope because the swing has two pieces, a right piece and a left piece. For this reason, I added two blocks of code, one for each piece. </p>
<p>The code to add the rope is<a id="_idIndexMarker352"/> nothing new; we’re just using the <code>Image</code> initializer to pass in our rope image and setting the aspect ratio to <code>fit</code>. But what is new here is that we’re using the <code>mask</code> modifier. The <code>mask</code> modifier applies a masking view to the view it’s<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> called on. The masking view defines the visible area of the view it is applied to, and any parts of the view that fall outside of the masking view’s frame will not be visible.</p>
<p>The <code>mask</code> modifier takes a single parameter, which is the view that will be used as the mask. If we pass in <code>gradient</code> as we’re doing here, we can gradually fade out the rope as it extends upward. This is where the <code>LinearGradient</code> function and our <code>fadeOutRope</code> property come into play; the latter contains an array of gradient colors (two colors actually, clear and black) that we pass into the <code>LinearGradient</code> function.</p>
<p>We also need to consider the <code>startPoint</code> (where you want to start blending in the next color) and the <code>endPoint</code> (where you want to end one color and start another color). In our code, the <code>startPoint</code> for the gradient is at the top of the rope image, and <code>endPoint</code> is at the bottom of the rope image. The reason why we want the start point at the top is so that it will have a clear color so we can fade out the rope as it moves upward.</p>
<p>In the final two lines of code, we set the size of the left and right rope images and offset them so they fit perfectly over the rope that’s attached to the swing. This is the result of adding the two rope images with the <code>mask</code> modifier:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.12: Our animation after adding the mask modifier " src="img/B18674_06_12.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.12: Our animation after adding the mask modifier</p>
<p>If you run the app <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>now, you’ll see that the rope extends up and fades away <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>at the top. This looks much better because now the rope appears to be somewhere near the branch.</p>
<p>To improve this even further, we can partially cover up the end of the rope by adding the leaves image to the <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>scene. To do this, add this final bit of code at the very end of the first <code>ZStack</code>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
Image("leaves").resizable().aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
        .frame(width: 460, height: 400)
        .rotationEffect(.degrees(-10), anchor: .trailing)
        .offset(x: -50, y: -180)</pre>
<p>This is familiar code that we have used already, adding leaves to the scene, setting an appropriate <code>aspectRatio</code> and <code>frame</code> size, rotating it to the correct angle, which is perpendicular to the<a id="_idIndexMarker357"/> branch, and finally locating it on the x-and y-axis with the <code>offset</code> modifier.</p>
<p>Now the rope at the top is partially hidden by the leaves, giving the effect that it's tied off somewhere up in the branch:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.13: Our completed animation " src="img/B18674_06_13.jpg"/>

<p>And <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>with that, the <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>project is complete. Run it and see what you think.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this project, we learned how to take an image and cut out various parts at the joints, use those new images in code, and animate them in different and interesting ways. We also worked with modifiers that we have worked with before, including <code>rotation</code>, <code>scale</code>, and <code>offset</code>, but also a new modifier, <code>mask</code>.</p>
<p>There are ways to take this project further. If you’re feeling curious, see whether you can cut the arms and head from the picture, and then give them some animation as well. Play around with the parameters so you can make each part move just enough to look natural. Maybe you can make the arms pivot at the elbow just slightly as the swing moves forward and backward. Add a button if you want so you can start and stop the animation that way. Mainly, just experiment and have fun!</p>
<p>In the next project, we will look at the three different axes of rotation, <em class="italic">x</em>, <em class="italic">y</em>, and <em class="italic">z</em>, and create an animation that will rotate a fan using gears and chains, similar to a bicycle chain that turns its gears.</p>
