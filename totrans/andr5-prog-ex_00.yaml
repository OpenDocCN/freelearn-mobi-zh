- en: Welcome to *Android 5 Programming by Example*, a step-by-step guide to developing
    Android mobile apps for the Lollipop platform. This book will take you through
    the installation and configuration of the development environment with the design,
    coding and testing processes, and on to publishing and monetizing your mobile
    apps.

- en: Along the way, we will develop a series of small, working apps, designed to
    introduce all the familiar features of mobile apps, such as maps and touchscreen
    events. We will cover, in detail, the features that are new to Android 5 and higher,
    particularly the new design language, Material Design.

- en: To achieve all this, you will use the Android Studio **Integrated Development
    Environment** (**IDE**) and the latest **Software Development Kit** (**SDK**).
    To test and debug apps, you will be able to use real devices connected to your
    computer and create virtual devices that emulate Android devices. All this software
    is open source and free to download and use.

- en: The Android platform is no longer restricted to phones and tablets, and, later
    in the book, you will be taken on a brief tour of Android Wear, TV, and Auto,
    learning how to adapt and extend the existing apps and create new apps designed
    specifically for these form factors.

- en: Logically, the book concludes with a detailed explanation of how to register
    as a Google Developer and publish your apps. To reach the widest possible number
    of users, you will see how to make Android 5 apps backwards compatible and include
    the Lollipop features on an older version. Finally, how to include in-app purchasing
    and advertising is covered, and at that point, you will be fully equipped to develop
    and distribute apps of your own invention.
