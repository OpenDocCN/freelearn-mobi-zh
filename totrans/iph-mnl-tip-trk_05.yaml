- en: Talking on the iPhone is just one of many ways you can communicate with others.
    Besides talking, another popular way to communicate is through text messages.
    Unlike phone calls, which require both parties to be free to chat at the same
    time, text messages allow you to carry on a conversation by typing in messages
    to each other and responding when it's convenient. Best of all, text messaging
    works for everyone who has a smartphone.

- en: Text messaging was originally called **Short Message Service** (**SMS**) and
    was designed as a cheaper way to communicate. Sending audio over cellular networks
    required large amounts of data but sending text required far less data, making
    it faster and cheaper to use.
  prefs: []

- en: Text messaging has grown beyond alphanumeric characters to include pictures,
    audio, and video as well as emoji symbols, such as a smiling face. **Multimedia
    Messaging Service** (**MMS**) is an expanded version of text messaging that lets
    you share all types of data with others.

    to your friends without making an actual phone call. On the iPhone, you send and
    receive text messages through the **Messages** app.

    you, jeopardizing your own life as well as the lives of others. If you must send
