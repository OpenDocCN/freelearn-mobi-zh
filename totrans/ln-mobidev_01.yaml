- en: Let's take one step back and focus on the question, *How will people find out
    about the app?* Unless it gets featured (by Apple, for example), or unless it
    gets discovered by accident (as happened to Flappy Bird), you need to promote
    it actively. You can consider Google ads, flyers, and commercials. That can become
    pretty expensive. However, if you can let it grow organically, the results will
    probably be way better, and it will cost you less. For example, people might hear
    on Twitter and other social media platforms how great your app is. To make that
    happen, people first need to become enthusiastic and regular users of your app
    before they share it with their friends or business colleagues.

  zh: 让我们退一步，关注这个问题：“人们将如何了解到这个应用？”除非它被特色推荐（例如，由苹果推荐），或者除非它意外被发现（就像Flappy Bird那样），否则你需要积极推广它。你可以考虑谷歌广告、传单和电视广告。这可能会变得相当昂贵。然而，如果你能让它自然增长，结果可能会好得多，而且成本会更低。例如，人们可能会在Twitter和其他社交媒体平台上听说你的应用有多好。为了实现这一点，人们首先需要成为你应用的热情和常规用户，然后他们才会与他们的朋友或商业同事分享。

- en: Some products capture widespread attention. Nir Eyal describes in his book *Hooked*
    what makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit. For example, Pokémon
    Go!, Facebook, or Instagram are all very addictive apps. People hear about the
    app, download it, and keep using it, on a daily basis even. Why is that? It seems
    there is an underlying pattern to the way technology hooks us. Nir Eyal provides
    answers to this and other questions by introducing the Hook Model. It is a four-step
    process that is embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly
    encourage customer behavior.

    Eyal通过介绍钩子模型来回答这个问题和其他问题。这是一个四步骤的过程，被嵌入到许多成功公司的产品中，以微妙地鼓励客户行为。

- en: Offering variable and unpredicatable rewards are important tools to hook users.
    There are many feedback loops already, but they are all predictable. Predictable
    loops do not create any desire. We should surprise the user and create a desire
    in the user. Gamification is an example of a tool to accomplish this. We can reward
    the user with a badge or other digital (or non digital) incentive.

  zh: 提供可变和不可预测的奖励是吸引用户的重要工具。已经存在许多反馈循环，但它们都是可预测的。可预测的循环不会产生任何欲望。我们应该让用户感到惊喜，并在用户中创造欲望。游戏化是完成这一目标的工具之一。我们可以用徽章或其他数字（或非数字）激励来奖励用户。
- en: The last phase of the hook is where we will ask the user to do something in
    return. We do not just want to increase the odds that the user will make another
    pass through the hook. Besides encouraging the user to continue (unlock a new
    level and get another badge!), we can ask the user for a rating of the app in
    the App Store or we can ask the user to share content of the app on social media
    (challenge a friend!).

- en: 'If we apply the model to another well-known game, Pokémon Go!, then the model
    will look like this: The user gets a notification and a pokemon is shown on the

    Not only can the process help your app grow, it will also increase the (perceived)

- en: To accomplish this, you need to build an app that people really want to use.
    To find out what people want, you can ask them what they need. That sounds easier
    than it actually is. Make sure you ask the right questions, and avoid getting
    only socially desired answers. Also, make sure you listen carefully to what they
    tell you. Bear in mind that, sometimes, they will have no clue what they want,
    until they see it. Here's an example of a survey.

    without the need to write a 100-page business plan that nobody is ever going to
