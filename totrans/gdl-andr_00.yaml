- en: The build process for an Android app is an incredibly complex procedure that
    involves many tools. To begin with, all the resource files are compiled and referenced
    in a R.java file, before the Java code is compiled and then converted to Dalvik
    bytecode by the dex tool. These files are then packaged into an APK file, and
    that APK file is signed with a debug or release key, before the app can finally
    be installed onto a device.

- en: Going through all these steps manually would be a tedious and time-consuming
    undertaking. Luckily, the Android Tools team has continued to provide developers
    with tools that take care of the entire process, and in 2013, they introduced
    Gradle as the new preferred build system for Android apps. Gradle is designed
    in a way that makes it easy to extend builds and plug into the existing build
    processes. It provides a Groovy-like DSL to declare builds and create tasks, and
    makes dependency management easy. Additionally, it is completely free and open
    source.

- en: By now, most Android developers have switched to Gradle, but many do not know
    how to make the best of it, and are unaware of what can be achieved with just
    a few lines of code. This book aims to help those developers, and turn them into
    Gradle power users. Starting with the basics of Gradle in an Android context,
    this book goes on to cover dependencies, build variants, testing, creating tasks,
    and more.
