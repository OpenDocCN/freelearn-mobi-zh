<h1 id="_idParaDest-335"><a id="_idTextAnchor675"/>The importance of profiling your Android applications</h1>
<p>In Android, <strong class="bold">profiling</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>process of analyzing an application’s performance to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Profiling your Android applications <a id="_idIndexMarker741"/>is crucial for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps you identify performance bottlenecks such as slow code, memory leaks, and excessive CPU usage. This knowledge can help you optimize your code and make your application run more efficiently.</li>
<li>It improves the user experience. A poorly performing application can lead to user frustration and negative reviews. By profiling your application and optimizing its performance, you can provide a better user experience, leading to increased user engagement and positive reviews.</li>
<li>It helps save time and money. It is much easier and less expensive to fix performance issues early on than to try to fix them later when they have become more complex.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, in this recipe, we will explore why profiling your Android applications is essential and look at best practices and tips<a id="_idTextAnchor676"/>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-336"><a id="_idTextAnchor677"/>Getting ready</h2>
<p>For this recipe, we will be looking at how to use the Profiler to profile our Android application. You do not need to create a new project; you can simply use a pre-existing project to follow along.<a id="_idTextAnchor678"/></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-337"><a id="_idTextAnchor679"/>How to do it…</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to get started with using a Profiler in Android:</p>
<ol>
<li>For this chapter, we are using Android Studio Flamingo 2022.2.1 Patch 1. In your Android Studio, go to <strong class="bold">View</strong> | <strong class="bold">Tool Windows</strong> | <strong class="bold">Profiler</strong> and click the Profiler, which will launch it.</li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">To be able to see any activity, you need to start your emulator.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.1 – The Profiler in Android Studio</p>
<ol>
<li value="2">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker742"/>also navigate to the bottom menu option, near to <strong class="bold">App Inspection</strong>; see the green arrow in <em class="italic">Figure 12</em><em class="italic">.2</em>, which indicates another place you can start a Profiler from. The read arrow indicates the emulator that is attached to visualize the profile.</li>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.2 – The Profiler started in Android Studio</p>
<ol>
<li value="3">When your <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>Profiler starts running, which means it is attached to your application, you should see <strong class="bold">CPU</strong>, <strong class="bold">MEMORY</strong>, and <strong class="bold">ENERGY</strong>. Depending on your application resources, the data might vary from what you see in <em class="italic">Figure 12</em><em class="italic">.3</em>.</li>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.3 – The Profiler running</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">You can do a lot, such as simply recording all your method traces, looking at how your resources are utilized, and analyzing the flame chart.</li>

<ol>
<li value="5">A CPU flame <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>chart is a type of performance visualization that shows the hierarchical structure of a program’s execution over time. It typically includes a timeline at the top of the chart, with function calls represented as rectangles stacked vertically.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the color, the width of each rectangle represents the duration of the function call, and the rectangle’s color represents the CPU usage of that function. The chart allows Android developers to identify which functions take up the most CPU time quickly and can help inform them where to debug and optimize performance, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12</em><em class="italic">.5</em>.</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.5 – The CPU flame chart</p>
<p>In other <a id="_idIndexMarker745"/>words, the application heap is a dedicated, hard, limited memory pool allocated to your app.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">If your app reaches the heap capacity and tries to allocate any extra memory, you will receive an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> message.</p>
<ol>
<li value="6">Finally, a memory leak is a software bug where a program or application repeatedly fails to release memory that it no longer needs, or your garbage collector is not working as expected. This can cause the program to gradually consume more and more memory over time, eventually leading to poor performance or the crashing of your application.<a id="_idTextAnchor680"/></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-338"><a id="_idTextAnchor681"/>How it works…</h2>
<p>An app performs poorly if it responds slowly, has choppy animations, freezes a lot, or consumes a lot of power. Fixing performance problems involves identifying areas where your application <a id="_idIndexMarker746"/>does not optimize the use of resources, such as the CPU, memory, graphics, network, or device battery.</p>
<p>Android Studio offers several tools to help developers spot and visualize potential problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CPU Profiler, which helps track runtime performance issues</li>
<li>The Memory Profiler, which helps track any memory allocations</li>
<li>The Network Profiler, which monitors network traffic usage</li>
<li>The Energy Profiler, which tracks energy usage, which can contribute to battery drain</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of profiling in Android through a lens of inspecting, improving, and monitoring your code base. See <em class="italic">Figure 12</em><em class="italic">.6</em>.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-340"><a id="_idTextAnchor684"/>Quick Android shortcuts to make your development faster</h1>
<p>Shortcuts can be helpful to developers by making their work quicker and more efficient, allowing them <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>to focus on writing code and solving problems rather than navigating menus and toolbars. Shortcuts can help automate repetitive tasks such as formatting code, renaming variables, or navigating between files, freeing developers’ time and mental energy for more meaningful work.</p>
<p>In addition, when developers use the same shortcuts across different tools and applications, it can help maintain consistency in their workflows and reduce the risk of errors caused by accidentally using the wrong command or tool. Also, for developers with disabilities or physical limitations, using shortcuts can be a more accessible way to interact with software than using a mouse or trackpa<a id="_idTextAnchor685"/>d.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-341"><a id="_idTextAnchor686"/>Getting ready</h2>
<p>This isn’t really a recipe but a list of useful shortcuts, we will look at widely used shortcuts in Windows and Mac, which are the most popular operating systems used on laptop<a id="_idTextAnchor687"/>s.</p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-351"><a id="_idTextAnchor706"/>How it works…</h2>
<p>Android Studio includes a powerful debugger for us developers to use. To debug an application using Android Studio, you need to first build and deploy the app on the device or emulator, then attach the debugger to the running process. This is also a skill that needs to <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>be learned and practiced becoming good at it. Hence, knowing how you can debug your application, either using logs or breakpoints, comes in handy.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-352"><a id="_idTextAnchor707"/>How to extract methods and method parameters</h1>
<p>Extracting methods and method parameters can add additional imports to your code. This happens <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>because when you extract a method or a parameter, the code that used to be inside the method or parameter is moved to a separate method. If this code relies on other classes or methods that are not already imported into your code, the extraction process may automatically add the necessary import statements to your file.</p>
<p>For example, suppose <a id="_idIndexMarker770"/>you have a Kotlin class that contains a method that performs some calculations and returns a result. This method relies on a helper class defined in another package, and you still need to import this class into your code. If you decide to extract the method to a particular method in the same or a different class, the extraction process may add an <code>import</code> statement for the helper class so that the code inside the extracted method can reference the helper class.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you extract a method parameter, the extraction process may need to include adding import statements to ensure that any classes or interfaces that are used in the parameter type are corr<a id="_idTextAnchor708"/>ectly resolved.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-353"><a id="_idTextAnchor709"/>Getting ready</h2>
<p>You do not need to create any project to foll<a id="_idTextAnchor710"/>ow this recipe.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-354"><a id="_idTextAnchor711"/>How to do it…</h2>
<p>To extract methods and method parameters in Android, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Kotlin file where you want to extract the methods and parameters.</li>
<li>Identify the <a id="_idIndexMarker771"/>class containing the methods and parameters you want to extract.</li>
<li>Place your <a id="_idIndexMarker772"/>cursor inside the class declaration, and right-click to open the context menu.</li>
<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Refactor</strong> option from the context menu, and then select <strong class="bold">Extract</strong> from the submenu.</li>
<li>In the <strong class="bold">Extract</strong> submenu, you will see options to extract a method or parameter. Select the option that matches the element you want to extract.</li>
<li>Follow the prompts in the <strong class="bold">Extract</strong> wizard to configure the extraction process. You may need to provide a name for the extracted element, specify the element’s scope, or configure other settings depending on the element you are extracting.</li>
<li>Once configured in the extraction process, click <strong class="bold">Finish</strong> to extract the elemen<a id="_idTextAnchor712"/>t from your code.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-355"><a id="_idTextAnchor713"/>How it works…</h2>
<p>Adding imports during method or parameter extraction is a normal part of the refactoring process and helps ensure that your code remains well organized and <a id="_idTextAnchor714"/>easy to maintain.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-356"><a id="_idTextAnchor715"/>Understanding Git essentials</h1>
<p>This recipe is <a id="_idIndexMarker773"/>meant to help any new developers that might have stumbled upon this book. <strong class="bold">Git</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker774"/>popular version control system that allows developers to manage and track changes to their code base.</p>
<p>Here are some essential concepts to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong class="bold">repository</strong> is a collection <a id="_idIndexMarker775"/>of files and folders that Git is tracking. It’s also <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>known as a <strong class="bold">repo</strong>. This is the most common term.</li>
<li>A <strong class="bold">commit</strong> is a snapshot <a id="_idIndexMarker777"/>of the changes made to a repository. Each commit has a unique identifier containing information about the changes made, such as the author, the date, and a message describing the changes.</li>
<li>A <strong class="bold">branch</strong> is a separate <a id="_idIndexMarker778"/>line of development that allows developers to work on different features or versions of a project simultaneously. It’s like a parallel universe of the repository.</li>
<li>When developing, <strong class="bold">merging</strong> your work refers to combining changes from one branch into <a id="_idIndexMarker779"/>another. It’s typically used when a feature is complete and ready to be integrated into the main branch.</li>
<li>A <strong class="bold">pull request</strong> is a GitHub <a id="_idIndexMarker780"/>feature that allows developers to propose changes to a repository and request that they be merged into the main branch. It includes a description of the changes and any supporting documentation or tests.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Cloning</strong> is creating <a id="_idIndexMarker781"/>a copy of a repository on your local machine.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Pushing</strong> is the process <a id="_idIndexMarker782"/>of sending changes from your local machine to a remote repository, such as GitHub or GitLab.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Pulling</strong> is the process <a id="_idIndexMarker783"/>of downloading changes from a remote repository to your local machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding these essential concepts, you can effectively use Git to manage your code base and collab<a id="_idTextAnchor716"/>orate with other developers.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-357"><a id="_idTextAnchor717"/>Getting ready</h2>
<p>We will not follow a recipe here but look at what Git commands you can utilize t<a id="_idTextAnchor718"/>o make collaboration easier.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-358"><a id="_idTextAnchor719"/>How to do it…</h2>
<p>Here are some <a id="_idIndexMarker784"/>of the most commonly used Git commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>To initialize a new Git repository in the current directory. You can simply do the following:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ git init</strong></pre></li>
<li>When you want to add changes to the staging area, you can simply use <code>git add</code>:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ git add file.txt</strong></pre></li>
<li>When committing changes to the repository, simply use the following:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ git commit -m "message"</strong></pre></li>
<li>Most important, when you start collaborating, is being able to clone the project; you can simply run the following:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ git clone git@github.com:PacktPublishing/Modern-Android-13-Development-Cookbook.git</strong></pre></li>
<li>When you want to pull changes from a remote repository to the local repository, simply use the following:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ git pull origin main</strong></pre></li>
<li>You can also push changes from the local repository to a remote repository by using the following:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ git push origin main</strong></pre></li>
<li>List all the local branches by using <code>git branch</code>:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ git branch</strong></pre></li>
<li>The following command switches to a different branch:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ git checkout branch_name</strong></pre></li>
<li>Check out a new branch with the following:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ git checkout -b branch_name</strong></pre></li>
<li>Merge changes from one branch into another with the following. Note you can also use <code>rebase</code>; this is based on the organization's prefer<a id="_idTextAnchor720"/>ence:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ git merge branch_name</strong></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a <a id="_idIndexMarker785"/>few of the most commonly used Git commands. Many more Git commands and options are available, so it’s worth exploring the Gi<a id="_idTextAnchor721"/>t documentation to learn more.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-359"><a id="_idTextAnchor722"/>How it works…</h2>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system allowing users to track code changes over time. Here’s a high-level overview of how Git works.</p>
<p>Git doesn’t just <a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>store the changes you make to your code; it actually stores snapshots of your entire project at different times. Each snapshot represents the state of the project at a specific moment. It stores your code in a tree-like structure, with each project snapshot represented by a commit object.</p>
<p>Each commit object points to the snapshot of the project that it represents and the commit objects that came before it. It also uses a unique pointer called <code>HEAD</code> to keep track of the current branch and the most recent commit on that branch.</p>
<p>When you make a new commit, Git updates the HEAD pointer to point to the new commit. In addition, each commit in Git is identified by a unique hash value, which is a 40-character string of letters and numbers. This hash value is generated based on the contents of the commit and the hash values of any previous commits that it points to.</p>
<p>Because Git stores snapshots of your project locally on your computer, you can work offline and still make commits to your project. When you’re ready to share your changes, you can push them to a remote repository.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the key concepts behind how Git works. Git is a powerful and flexible tool <a id="_idIndexMarker787"/>with many advanced features, so it’s worth learning more about how it works.</p>
