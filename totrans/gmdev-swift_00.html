The App Store provides a unique opportunity to distribute your ideas to a massive audience. Now, Swift has arrived to bolster our toolkit and provide a smoother development experience. Swift is new, but is already hailed as an excellent, well-designed language. Whether you are new to game development or looking to add to your expertise, I think you will enjoy making games with Swift.</p><p>My goal in writing this book is to share a fundamental knowledge of Swift and SpriteKit. We will work through a complete example game so that you learn every step of the Swift development process. Once you finish this text, you will be comfortable designing and publishing your own game ideas to the App Store, from start to finish.</p><p>Please reach out with any questions and share your game creations:</p><p>E-mail: <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:stephen@thinkingswiftly.com">stephen@thinkingswiftly.com</a>&gt;</code>

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>This book uses the Xcode IDE Version 6.3.2 (Swift 1.2). If you use a different version of Xcode, you will likely encounter syntax differences; Apple is constantly upgrading Swift's syntax.</p><p>Visit <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode">https://developer.apple.com/xcode</a>/ to download Xcode.</p><p>You will need an Apple developer account to integrate your apps with the Game Center and to submit your games to the App Store.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>If you wish to create and publish fun iOS games using Swift, then this book is for you. You should be familiar with basic programming concepts such as classes, types, and functions. However, no prior game development or Apple ecosystem experience is required. Additionally, experienced game programmers will find this book useful as they transition into game development with Swift.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The game invokes the <code class="literal">didMoveToView</code> function whenever it switches to this scene."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">let mySprite = SKSpriteNode(color: UIColor.blueColor(), size: 
    CGSize(width: 50, height: 50))
mySprite.position = CGPoint(x: 300, y: 300)
self.addChild(mySprite)</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">    // Find the width of one-third of the children nodes
<span class="strong"><strong>    jumpWidth = tileSize.width * floor(tileCount / 3)</strong></span>
}</pre></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>New terms</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>important words</strong></span> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Select <span class="strong"><strong>iOS</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Application</strong></span> in the left pane, and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> in the right pane."</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
