This chapter will also cover project planning before any project even gets created. You'll see later why determining what features you want early can help speed up the process of creating a game. Project examples, references to downloading, and setup information will be found here. We'll then take a deep dive into the various additional third-party libraries and tools in the Cocos2d ecosystem that you may want to consider.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Planning for a successful game</li><li class="listitem">Additional tools you might want to consider</li><li class="listitem">Setting flexible, focused goals</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Preparing the mindset"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Preparing the mindset</h1></div></div></div><p>First, we'll discuss how to structure your project from start to finish, and why you should do that instead of just jumping right in. We're going to discuss some theory and ask you questions to help you determine what exactly your project will need before even a line of code is written.</p><p>Before you start planning, you<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/> need to ask questions about key features your game needs, as they will require additional support and development. For example, is there a physics engine involved? Are you going to implement Game Center or In-App Purchases or possibly connect to a database to store the user's information? How complex are the mechanics? Start thinking of the answers to these and similar questions, as knowing the answers will help you move faster and still remain efficient.</p><div class="section" title="The physics engine"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>The physics engine</h2></div></div></div><p>Although this is not something that most people will know off the top of their head when they first start planning<a id="id1" class="indexterm"/> their project, it's important to know. Luckily, with Cocos2d, there's a physics engine built into the code for you, which is nice because you don't have to go out of your way to implement one.</p><p>If you find your project does need a physics engine (or would be much more 'realistic' with it), you can refer to <a class="link" title="Chapter 5. Creating Cool Content" href="part0042.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating Cool Content</em></span>, later on in this book to understand how to implement it, as well as example code to use.</p><p>If you're unsure of whether you should use a physics engine or not, here are a few examples of games that use Box2D, one of the built-in physics engines with Cocos2d. Take a look at the physics in <span class="emphasis"><em>Angry Birds</em></span> by Rovio:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00196.jpeg" alt="The physics engine"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>In the preceding screenshot, each bird and each pig is a circle-shaped physics object, the ground is a rectangle, and all the obstacles on the right-hand side (except the pigs) are rectangles. When the bird gets flung from the left side to the right side, gravity starts acting on the bird and begins pulling it down. Once collisions occur, it pushes the objects around and does some fancy "damage" calculations based on the velocity of the incoming and colliding object.</p><p>The following<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/> screenshot is of the physics in <span class="emphasis"><em>Crescent Ridge Mini Golf</em></span> by KeitGames:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00197.jpeg" alt="The physics engine"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>In the preceding screenshot, the ball is a circle-shaped physics object, and each wall has a set of vertices that act as the boundaries through which the ball cannot pass. There is no gravity in play here, or else the ball would be constantly falling to the bottom of the screen. If the ball bounces on a wall, the physics engine knows exactly what angle the ball will turn by, and by what velocity it will go backwards. Being able to determine the angle of reflection of the golf ball was the main reason a physics engine was used to create a simple mini golf game.</p><p>If you're still unsure, then answering "yes" to any of the following questions means you should consider using a physics engine. If your answer to any of the following questions is "yes," then refer to <a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Focusing on Physics" href="part0029.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Focusing on Physics</em></span>, to learn how to implement a physics engine. If your answer to all of these questions is "no," then I suggest holding off for now because your game probably doesn't need an engine, and instead, it can be coded in a way that gives the impression of physics but doesn't actually use a physics engine:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Do you need noncircular or nonrectangular objects to collide?</li><li class="listitem">Do objects need to bounce off of each other or push other objects?</li><li class="listitem">Does your game make use of real-time gravity?</li></ul></div><p>If you're<a id="id3" class="indexterm"/> interested in making use of any liquid physics or using soft bodies in your game, feel free to check out LiquidFun. However, this book will not cover how to implement or use that engine.</p></div><div class="section" title="In-App Purchases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>In-App Purchases</h2></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>In-App Purchases</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IAPs</strong></span>) are a feature that are a result of design decisions, possibly to make the game<a id="id4" class="indexterm"/> cheaper and/or include expansions or extra content in the game. There are a lot of ways you can utilize IAPs, but<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/> forcing them into your game instead of designing them as an integral part of the experience could cause your players to either not utilize the IAPs you took so much time to implement, or just stop playing the game altogether.</p><p>The thing about IAPs is that Apple requires your project's provisioning profile to have the IAPs permission added—that's the easy part. The hard part is getting them included in your code. Here are some examples of In-App Purchases in various games. The following screenshot is of the shop in <span class="emphasis"><em>Clash of Clans</em></span> by Supercell:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00198.jpeg" alt="In-App Purchases"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>In the preceding screenshot, you see the various IAPs available in <span class="emphasis"><em>Clash of Clans</em></span>. You can see that they have a tiered structure such that as the player spends more money in one go, they get more <a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>gems per dollar spent. The following <a id="id7" class="indexterm"/>screenshot is of the bank in <span class="emphasis"><em>Bina Blocks</em></span> by KeitGames:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00199.jpeg" alt="In-App Purchases"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>What you just saw is a screenshot of the bank in <span class="emphasis"><em>Bina Blocks</em></span>. You can see a similar tier of pricing as was in <span class="emphasis"><em>Clash of Clans</em></span>.</p><p>Although IAP implementation is not covered in this book, it can still be a significant constituent of your game. If you wish to continue learning how to implement your own IAPs, you can<a id="id8" class="indexterm"/> read about them from any of these <a id="id9" class="indexterm"/>sources:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/21081/introduction-to-in-app-purchases-in-ios-6-tutorial">http://www.raywenderlich.com/21081/introduction-to-in-app-purchases-in-ios-6-tutorial</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.playngive.com/blog/2010/3/6/adding-in-app-store-to-cocos2d.html">http://www.playngive.com/blog/2010/3/6/adding-in-app-store-to-cocos2d.html</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="ulink" href="http://troybrant.net/blog/2010/01/in-app-purchases-a-full-walkthrough/">http://troybrant.net/blog/2010/01/in-app-purchases-a-full-walkthrough/</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Making use of analytics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Making use of analytics</h2></div></div></div><p>Analytics packages are a great tool that any developer can make use of. If you want to know what level your users are getting stuck at the most, you can track how many times each level was beaten to see<a id="id10" class="indexterm"/> where the drop-off happens. Or maybe, you want to track how people are using the new characters you just added. In <a class="link" title="Chapter 7. Reaching Our Destination" href="part0057.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Reaching Our Destination</em></span>, you'll learn how to implement Flurry Analytics, which uses a simple, event-driven system used to track when certain methods get called. Essentially, you can track anything from a button press and screen loading to the time a user spent on a problem. All of this data is sent to Flurry's server and compiled into easy-to-read charts and graphs.</p><p>Although your users won't notice any difference, it'll definitely make your game better in the long run, as you can see what is happening when your players interact with your game. Thus, you can submit better updates as time goes on.</p></div><div class="section" title="Complex mechanics and special effects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>Complex mechanics and special effects</h2></div></div></div><p>The term "complex mechanics" can be a bit vague or general at times. However, it can be anything from a really<a id="id11" class="indexterm"/> smooth transition between your game's scenes to a unique control system for the way the player plays the game. If you feel that your game<a id="id12" class="indexterm"/> needs these complex mechanics to become successful, them make sure you do it right. If you're only planning to add extra bells and whistles because you feel that you have to, and not because it's part of making your game better, then thinking of this beforehand can help structure your project plan in a way that allows the addition of extra (or bonus) features at the end of development. This is better than attempting to add things halfway through and delaying necessary features if you can't figure out how to code them right away.</p><p>There are some games that are very special because of their unique gameplay mechanics, in combination with making use of the touch screen (which we will cover in detail in <a class="link" title="Chapter 4. Sound and Music" href="part0035.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Sounding Off</em></span>). For example, if you look at <span class="emphasis"><em>Smash Hit</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Blek</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Tiny Wings</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>Threes!</em></span>, you'll see that they don't quite fit into any traditional genre.</p><p>Note that if you're<a id="id13" class="indexterm"/> relatively new to game design (especially when it comes to mobile design), it might not be entirely in your best interest to try something completely new or unique. Instead, try at least replicating mechanics that already exist, and<a id="id14" class="indexterm"/> possibly tweaking them slightly to better fit the game that you're trying to make. The following screenshot is of <span class="emphasis"><em>Smash Hit</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00200.jpeg" alt="Complex mechanics and special effects"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>The next screenshot is of <span class="emphasis"><em>Blek</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00201.jpeg" alt="Complex mechanics and special effects"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>The following<a id="id15" class="indexterm"/> screenshot is<a id="id16" class="indexterm"/> of <span class="emphasis"><em>Tiny Wings</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00202.jpeg" alt="Complex mechanics and special effects"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>This screenshot is of <span class="emphasis"><em>Threes!</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00203.jpeg" alt="Complex mechanics and special effects"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>These are games that thrive on their complex mechanics and special effects. They were extremely well-planned and properly designed. If you're only looking for special effects (for example, particle explosions or <a id="id17" class="indexterm"/>faces on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Threes!</em></span> cards), then <a class="link" title="Chapter 7. Reaching Our Destination" href="part0057.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Reaching Our Destination</em></span>, is where you should look. That chapter goes into detail <a id="id18" class="indexterm"/>of how to polish your game and increase its likeability factor. But for now, just know that if you plan to do something unique, creative, or never done before as an integral part of your design, you should plan accordingly.</p><p>If you are adding mechanics just because you think it would be cool to have it and it isn't necessary for the<a id="id19" class="indexterm"/> game's progression, then plan it at the end. There's nothing worse than delaying your game's launch date because of a feature that isn't really that important in<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/> the first place.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Choosing tools and getting started"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>Choosing tools and getting started</h1></div></div></div><p>Knowing which tools your <a id="id21" class="indexterm"/>project is going to need before you start working is a good place to start. In this way, when the time comes to implement a given feature, you can easily open the program and use the tool you've gotten beforehand. It's not too bad to get the tools halfway through the project, but from experience, it's better to think of it before you start to work on a project.</p><p>There are a few third-party programs out there that make development of games using Cocos2d go a lot faster.

If it feels jarring or feels like two different styles clashing, then it might be in your best interest to choose a more suitable font for your game. Don't worry; it might not come to you right away, but if you find the right font, it adds that extra layer of polishing that's crucial to making your game a success (we'll talk more about polishing in <a class="link" title="Chapter 6. Tidying Up and Polishing" href="part0049.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Tidying Up and Polishing</em></span>).</p></div><div class="section" title="VertexHelper"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15"/>VertexHelper</h2></div></div></div><p>Are you using physics in<a id="id48" class="indexterm"/> the game?

VertexHelper can help you find the coordinates that make up the shape of a complex object by importing an image and allowing you to <a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>click where you want the vertices to be. You can manually guess and test the coordinates programmatically if you really want, but VertexHelper makes this process a lot faster and keeps the coordinates accurate (assuming that the physics is implemented properly in the code).</p><p>If you're going to make use of physics (or collisions in general), you should be aware that vertex collisions can be incredibly expensive. If possible, it's best to stick to primitives (for example, circles or squares), And if that's the case, it may be that you don't even need a physics engine.

With this, you can use Xcode's built-in <span class="strong"><strong>Source Control</strong></span> menu, or go through Terminal to use your Git commands.</p><p>If you wish to install Git manually, simply go to their website and follow the links to download and<a id="id60" class="indexterm"/> install, at <a class="ulink" href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a>.</p><p>Note that if you've never used any source control before, feel free to read how it works at <a class="ulink" href="https://help.github.com/">https://help.github.com/</a>.</p><p>You will actually need Git installed only <a id="id61" class="indexterm"/>on your Mac, as that's where the code is. However, you can install it on any desktop OS.</p><p>Both GitHub and Bitbucket are free to use. However, the key difference is that GitHub offers unlimited public repositories, while Bitbucket offers unlimited private repositories. So if you want to keep your code hidden from others while still making use of the services listed, it's recommended to go with Bitbucket.</p><p>Both of these services use Git and make use of the same commands and tools. It's just a preference between whether you want to go with public or private repositories (or the case where someone else you work with has a preference).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Setting flexible, focused goals"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Setting flexible, focused goals</h1></div></div></div><p>When you first came up with your idea to make a game, you probably thought it was the best game idea since the beginning of gaming. It honestly might be; don't let my words hold you back. However, as time passes, your vision of this game might change and your direction might shift a little or a lot as new ideas are generated throughout the project's life cycle. It's best to come<a id="id62" class="indexterm"/> up with a focused goal that's also a bit flexible to leave room for improvement while staying on track when it gets too much out of hand.</p><div class="section" title="Expand"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18"/>Expand</h2></div></div></div><p>If you're struggling with coming up with an original idea, I recommend that you get a whiteboard (the bigger the better; trust me), open an image editing software on your computer, or even get some pens and paper, and just start writing down whatever you want to make <a id="id63" class="indexterm"/>a game about. Pick a topic related to the game's genre, or synonyms related to the main mechanics involved, and start making a map (something like a spider web) of ideas that you can use in the initial phase of creating your game.</p><p>However, creating the initial idea can be tough on its own; for example, when is a project ever really ready such that you can begin the coding or the art creation process? Is it after the first mechanics implementation? Or is it when each of the 27 levels is methodically mapped from start to finish? It's important to realize that moment when you've stopped expanding and improving the game, which is getting better as you come up with more ideas, and you're <a id="id64" class="indexterm"/>coming up with ideas just because you can.</p></div><div class="section" title="Focus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec19"/>Focus</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you have a good idea of the type of game you want to make, it's time to focus that end goal in such a way that it allows flexibility later. In my honest opinion, making games is all about flow<a id="id65" class="indexterm"/> and the creation of ideas as time passes by. So, if you're in the middle of making a game and you think adding another enemy type or a few side quests might make the game more interesting, then don't hesitate to do so.</p><p>That said, you can't be flip-flopping all over the place from one idea to the next, or else your game will lack a sense of direction as the player goes through it. They will feel as if the plot never resolves the initial conflicts presented.</p><p>Plus, if your game lacks a focused end goal and is constantly changing over time, it will just take longer to develop. So, speaking from experience, if you want to create two different game ideas, the second of which is something you thought would be cool halfway through the development of the first game, either add it in as an update or expansion after the first game is released, or turn it into a separate project, but don't delay the development longer than it already has to.</p><p>So what are some of the things you should have in a focused goal? If your game has a narrative or is somehow plot driven, try to ensure that this stays intact throughout the development. Or, if your game is dependent on a single feature of mechanics and you want to add another feature halfway through the game, ensure that the newly added feature does not affect the initial user experience that was thought about when first coming up with the idea of the game. However, if the feature you want to add isn't really that important for the initial part of the game, then don't worry about it now and just include it in an update. Trust me; unless it's going take a few minutes to add the new feature, it's probably not worth spending your time on something that's not very necessary for the game to work as intended when it was first designed. Or, if the art style of the game just isn't very appealing or could be represented in another way, think about how important the art really is for your game. If it's low-quality art, as done in MS Paint for example, then consider getting some higher-quality art. However, if it's already polished, then don't bother changing it until after the release.</p></div><div class="section" title="Flex"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec20"/>Flex</h2></div></div></div><p>I've mentioned in the preceding section: do not hesitate to be a bit lenient when it comes to your game's mechanics, narrative, art style, and so on. As your game progresses, you will almost inevitably think, "Oh my gosh, wouldn't it be the best game in the world if we just added this one extra boss at the end?" Maybe, it will. And that's where you would want to be<a id="id66" class="indexterm"/> flexible.</p><p>But remember to try staying true to that focused goal we talked about in the previous section. It's all about keeping that balance between laser-focused goals and free-flowing creativity at every step of the way.</p></div></div>

For those unfamiliar with SpriteBuilder, let me tell you that it is used to create projects with a drag-and-drop interface. You do not need to create your game entirely through SpriteBuilder.

It may ask you to join their mailing list, but it doesn't make a difference in this book whether you sign up or not.</p><p>After that, it may look as if a new project has already been started (which may be the case, but let's make sure we start fresh). Go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span>, and choose a folder location you will remember (for example, \<code class="literal">Desktop</code> or \<code class="literal">Documents</code>).

Remember that I told you to save it in a place that you'll remember? Go back to that location, either in <span class="strong"><strong>Finder</strong></span> or by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Xcode</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Open viewer</strong></span>.</p><p>Find the file with the same name as your project. It should look something like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">ProjectName.xcodeproj</pre></div><p>If you do not see the .<code class="literal">xcodepoj</code> file extension, don't worry. It should be labelled as Xcode project in the kind filter and have a blueprint icon next to it.</p><p>Click on that to open it.
