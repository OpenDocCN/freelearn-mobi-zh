            <p>In the last couple of chapters, we reviewed the basics of Swift to get you warmed
               up. Before we start building our app, we need to look at one more programming concept—collections.
               In Swift, we have three primary collection types, which we will cover in this chapter:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Arrays</li>
               
               <li>Dictionaries</li>
               
               <li>Sets</li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>We will dig deeper into each one, but we will start with the most common collection
               type—arrays.
            </p>

            <h1 class="header-title">Arrays</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Arrays are ordered collections of values and can hold any number of items, for example,
               a list of Strings, Ints, floating-point values, and so on. Arrays are stored in an
               ordered list, starting at <kbd>0</kbd>. Let's look at a diagram:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="117" src="assets/ff2059ca-65e0-4487-ae0e-9c1fdd17b085.png" width="350"/></div>
            
            <p>Starting from left to right in the preceding examples, we first have an array that
               holds a collection of Strings. In the second example, we have another array that holds
               a collection of Ints. In our third example, we have an array that holds a collection
               of floating-point values.
            </p>
            
            <p>Now, let's review the following diagram, which is a mixed array:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="156" src="assets/f5f4a9ba-f462-4a49-861f-5f904f343b7c.png" width="129"/></div>
            
            <p>Since this example contains mixed data types, such as Strings, Ints, and bools, we
               would have to name this an array type of Any. This means that we can have mixed data
               types inside of our array. Until you are really comfortable with arrays, I would not
               recommend using them. Try to stick to arrays with the same data type because you know
               the exact data type of each element.
            </p>
            
            <p>An array can hold any data type, but making the array strongly typed means every element
               in it must be of the same type.
            </p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>Let's now create a few arrays in Playgrounds.</p>
            
            <p>Sometimes, you may want to remove your prior entries from your Playground, so that
               it makes it easier for you to see each new <kbd>print</kbd> statement. Do that now and input the following:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/5af25f5d-ffa4-4baa-a5bf-264c74d81da6.png"/></div>
            
            <p>We just created our first two arrays. The data types within each set of brackets tells
               Swift what type of an array we want to create. The first array (integers) we created
               has a data type of Ints, and our second array (strings) has a data type of Strings.
            </p>
            
            
            
         </article>

            <h1 class="header-title">Creating an array with initial values</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Arrays can have initial values when they are created. Let's see how this would look
               by entering the following in Playgrounds:
            </p>
            <pre>let integers2 = [54, 29]  </pre>
            <p>Your code will now look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/90e9eb12-1431-4371-909c-48f02898bd86.png"/></div>
            
            <p>The array that we just entered uses type inference to declare the data type of the
               array using its initial values. In this case, Swift understands that it is an array
               of Ints, because the values we entered are integers. In addition, when we use a constant
               (<kbd>let</kbd>) on an array, we are telling Swift that the array is an immutable array, which means
               that the contents or size cannot change once it is instantiated.
            </p>

            <p>It is best practice to make all arrays (and for that matter, collections) immutable,
               but there are some cases where you will need to create an array that is mutable. Let's
               have some fun and create a mutable array:
            </p>
            <pre>var states:[String] = [] </pre>
            <p>As an aside, when creating a mutable array (or any variable), note that each variable
               must be unique.
            </p>
            
            <p>One use for a mutable array is so that we can change an array. Let's look at some
               ways we can do this.
            </p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>Let's add some data to our array. There are a few different convenience methods for
               adding data to an array.
            </p>
            
            <p>A convenience method is, just as its name implies, a method that makes things convenient.
               A method is a function that lives inside of a class. We will discuss classes later
               in this book. If this is starting to get overwhelming, it is understandable. You do
               not need to worry about every single detail at this time. We will cover this again
               and things will slowly start to click at some point. Everyone learns differently,
               so there is no reason to worry if someone else understands something more quickly.
               Just go at your own pace.
            </p>
            
            <p>The first convenience method we will look at is the <kbd>append()</kbd> method:
            </p>
            <pre>states.append(23) </pre>
            <p>Your code and the output window should now look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/68f2422e-eeb8-47b4-b3ff-b835e5ec8bc0.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Houston, we have a problem! You will see that we are getting an error. Actually, I
               did this for a couple of reasons. Getting errors is normal and common. Most people
               who start out coding are afraid to make a mistake or get scared about getting or seeing
               errors. Trust me, I have been coding for years and I make mistakes all the time. The
               error is telling us that we tried to add an Int into an array that can only hold Strings.
            </p>
            
            <p>Every developer, from a beginner to an experienced one, will face a time when he or
               she will encounter an error that he or she cannot figure out. This error might get
               you frustrated to the point where you want to throw the computer across the room (I
               have been there a few times). The best advice my boss ever gave me was to take a walk
               for 10-15 minutes or do something to take your mind off of it. Sometimes this helps
               and you will come up with an idea after you walk away. Even if you come back and it
               still takes you hours to figure out what is wrong, this is still part of the process.
               The best errors are the ones that were the simplest thing you overlooked and you had
               to spend hours trying to figure out. You might have lost time, but you will have learned
               a great lesson. Lessons like these will stay with you forever and you will never forget
               the error the next time you encounter it. So, if your coding results in an error,
               even in this book, embrace the challenge, because there is no greater feeling than
               figuring out a challenging error.
            </p>
            
            <p>So, let's correct what we just did by revising the array to show the following:</p>
            <pre>states.append("Florida") </pre>
            <p>This is how your code should now look:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/dd3cf6c2-1ecf-46b3-9c80-92fbbe99fe04.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In the Results panel, you can actually see the contents of our corrected array.</p>
            
            <p>Since an array can hold any number of items, let's add some more. Earlier, I mentioned
               that we have a variety of ways to add items to an array. The <kbd>append()</kbd> method allows us to add only one item at a time. In order to add multiple items,
               we can use the convenience called <kbd>append(contentsOf:)</kbd>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Add the following to Playgrounds:</p>
            <pre>states.append(contentsOf:["California", "New York"]) </pre>
            <p>Now, your code should look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/02254909-89ef-4a4f-900f-22841316295d.png"/></div>
            
            <p>We added two more items into our array, but, so far, every example we have utilized
               has added items at the end of our array. We have two convenience methods that allow
               us to add items at any index position that is available in the array.
            </p>
            
            <p>The first method we can use to do this is called <kbd>insert(at:)</kbd>, which allows us to add a single item at a certain index position. We also have <kbd>insert(contentsOf:at:)</kbd>, which allows us to add multiple items into an array at a certain index position.
               Let's use them both and add <kbd>Ohio</kbd> after California and then <kbd>North Carolina</kbd>, <kbd>South Carolina</kbd>, and <kbd>Nevada</kbd> after <kbd>Ohio</kbd>:
            </p>
            <pre>states.insert("Ohio", at:1) 
states.insert(contentsOf:["North Carolina", "South Carolina", "Nevada"],at:3) </pre>
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/56af51fa-66ce-4be7-b6c9-b23a66d7a1f2.png"/></div>
            
            <p>We just added items to our array using <kbd>append(contentsOf:)</kbd>, but there also is a shorthand version of this using the <kbd>+=</kbd> operator. Let's add the following:
            </p>
            <pre>states += ["Texas", "Colorado"] </pre>
            <p>Now, your code should look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/69019fef-88ed-4309-9bf2-b662f90d42b9.png"/></div>
            
            <p>This technique for adding items is much more concise and is my preferred way of inserting
               items into an array. Writing less code is not always better but, in this case, using
               the <kbd>+=</kbd> operator is my go-to method.
            </p>

            <p>If you are keeping track, we now have nine items in our array. Luckily, we do not
               have to keep track of how many items are in our array, because we have a property
               called <kbd>count</kbd>. This property will keep track of the current item count and give us the total count
               of our array when we want to check. Let's look at the count for states:
            </p>
            <pre>states.count </pre>
            <p>Your code will now look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/d69d069c-5a8d-44c3-8b07-08062fa0fb3a.png"/></div>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>The <kbd>count</kbd> property is not the only property we can use to calculate how many items are in an
               array. The most commonly used property for an array is called <kbd>isEmpty</kbd>. This property uses the <kbd>count</kbd> property by checking to see if the count is greater than <kbd>0</kbd>. This method will return true or false, depending on whether there are any items
               within our array. Since you learned that <kbd>if...else</kbd> statements work well with bools, let's use this <kbd>isEmpty</kbd> property in an <kbd>if...else</kbd> statement.
            </p>
            
            <p>Add the following into Playgrounds:</p>
            <pre>if states.isEmpty { 
  print("There are no items in the array") 
} 
else { 
  print("There are currently (states.count) total items in our array") 
} </pre>
            <p>Now, your code and the output should look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/d4790540-2a99-4b12-8f38-f78a879b4092.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now, our Debug panel prints: <kbd>There are currently total nine items in our array</kbd>.
            </p>
            
            <p>One thing to remember in programming is that sometimes there are multiple ways of
               writing a piece of code. It is not shocking to meet someone who will approach the
               same problem differently than you did. To me, this is why programming is so great.
               Ultimately, all that matters is that it works as expected, especially when you are
               new to programming.
            </p>
            
            <p>All programming languages have what is known as a style guide, which is a preferred
               way to write code, and it is no different in Swift. Preferred just means a suggested
               method, but even then, you will notice that most preferred methods vary on certain
               things. For now, you do not need to worry about different style guides, other than
               to know that they exist. In this book, we will follow a style that I have adopted

            </p>
            
            <p>Once you get comfortable, I recommend that you start to look at style guides and adapt
               them into your code. Knowing different styles helps you to know your options as well
               as to understand what others are doing with their code, even if you do not agree with
               how they write something. If you write your code with a certain structure or style
               throughout a project, it will make it easier for you to come back to your code if
               you, for instance, had to take a break for some reason, such as starting another project
               or just taking some time off.

            <h1 class="header-title">Retrieving a value from an array</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>We discussed creating arrays as well as adding items into an array. Now, let's turn
               to retrieving a value from an array. Since arrays are stored by their index, we can
               use their index to retrieve values. Let's retrieve California:
            </p>
            <pre>let state = states[3] </pre>
            <p>Now, your code should look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/4240873e-0455-4aaf-8a84-7929ee564baf.png"/></div>
            
            <p>The Results panels shows North Carolina and not California. Remember, arrays start
               at <kbd>0</kbd>, not <kbd>1</kbd>. Therefore, in order for us to get California, we would actually need use the index
               position of <kbd>2</kbd>. Let's make that update in Playgrounds:
            </p>
            <pre>let state = states[2] </pre>
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/31b28d9d-8da0-4d26-b1b7-f40178321c3b.png"/></div>
            
            <p>There we go!</p>
            
            <p>We now have this great list of states, but someone told you that Arizona also is amazing.
               Instead of just adding Arizona to our list, you decide that you'd actually prefer
               to replace South Carolina with Arizona. We could simply look at our array and see
               in which index South Carolina is. This would not be helpful, however, if it were to
               change or if the state for which you were searching did not exist. So, the safe way
               to code this is to check the array for an item, and, if that item is found, then Swift
               will give us its current index position. The <kbd>index(of:)</kbd> method is what we will use to get the index position of South Carolina:
            </p>
            <pre>if let index = states.index(of:"South Carolina") { 
  print("Current index position is \(index)") 
} </pre>
            <p>This is how our code and output should now look:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/fa60b336-11e7-4466-99a6-c926b104fdff.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now that we have the position, we can replace South Carolina with Arizona, like so:</p>
            <pre>if let index = states.index(of:"South Carolina") { 
  states[index] = "Arizona" 
} </pre>
            <p><span>This is how our code should now look:</span></p>

            <p>It would be nice if we could see a list of the states in our array. Earlier, you learned
               that <kbd>for...in</kbd> loops work with sequences. Since our array is a sequence, we can use <kbd>for...in</kbd> loops to loop through each element. When working on a project that has arrays, it
               is helpful to use a <kbd>print</kbd> statement inside of a <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop. This lets us print every item in our array to the Debug panel. So, let's use
               a <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop to look at the contents of our array:
            </p>
            <pre>for state in states { 
  print(state) 
} </pre>
            <p><span>This is how our code and output should now look:</span></p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/0a3b6061-2a4d-4181-b74c-4302f3f54dbd.png"/></div>

            <h1 class="header-title">Removing items from an array</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Now, it is time to start deleting items from our array. Let's delete the first item
               from our list. We have a convenience method for removing items from an array, called <kbd>removeFirst()</kbd>. This method will remove the first item from our array, which in our case is Florida.
               Let's remove Florida and add this line above our <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop:
            </p>
            <pre>states.removeFirst() </pre>
            <p><span>This is how our code and output should now look:</span></p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/d251ad4e-45c0-46c4-be23-8a91e14c0d6e.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Since we removed Florida, all of our states' index positions will be updated to move
               one position closer to the top of the array. But what if we wanted to remove an item
               that was not first? In order to do this, we can use the <kbd>remove(at:)</kbd> convenience. So, let's remove North Carolina and New York, which are sitting at positions
               <kbd>2</kbd> and <kbd>4</kbd>, respectively. We will add the following above our <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop:
            </p>
            <pre>states.remove(at:2) 
states.remove(at:4) </pre>
            <p><span>This is how our code and output should now look:</span></p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/e4a8fdfa-c471-4fe5-83d4-a20adb2d361e.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now, both North Carolina and New York have been removed. You will see that California
               and Ohio did not move, but Colorado and Nevada moved up closer to the top of the list.
               To remove the remaining six items, we could use <kbd>remove(at:)</kbd> for each one, but instead we will use the simpler method of <kbd>removeAll()</kbd>. So, let's use <kbd>removeAll()</kbd> in Playgrounds:
            </p>
            <pre>states.removeAll() </pre>
            <p>Now, your code should look something like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/15cfa34d-96ea-4707-936b-b6119894b292.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now, we are back to where we started with an empty array. We have only scratched the
               surface for arrays. We will do more with arrays later in this book, but we first need
               to look at the next collection type: dictionaries.

         <article>
            
            
            <p>A dictionary is an unordered collection of values with each one accessed through a
               unique key. Let's look at the following diagram:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="203" src="assets/98e993db-3266-4852-af82-03cb6afc17cd.png" width="298"/></div>
            
            <p>In our diagram, we have a dictionary of pizzas (<strong>keys</strong>) with their prices (<strong>values</strong>). In order to find something inside of a dictionary, we must look it up by its key.
               Let's look at a dictionary syntax:
            </p>
            <pre>Dictionary&lt;Key, Value&gt;  </pre>
            
            
            </article>

            <h1 class="header-title">Creating a dictionary</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>The traditional way of creating a dictionary is to first declare it as a dictionary
               and then, inside angle brackets, declare a type for the key and value. Let's create
               our first dictionary inside Playgrounds:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/b974de7d-7228-4379-931e-e47f73501cf9.png"/></div>
            
            <p>The immutable dictionary we created earlier has a data type of String for both its
               key and value. We have multiple ways to create a dictionary. Let's look at another
               by adding the following into Playgrounds:
            </p>
            <pre>let dictSecondExample = [String: Int]() </pre>
            <p>Your code should now look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/d95235ac-7fda-41e9-b65b-774be606d4e5.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In this latest example, we created another immutable dictionary, with its key having
               a data type of String and its value having a data type of Int.
            </p>
            
            <p>If we wanted to use our pizza diagram, the key would have a data type of a String
               and the value would have a data type of a Double. Let's create this dictionary in
               Playgrounds, but, this time, we will make it a mutable dictionary and give it an initial
               value:
            </p>
            <pre>var dictThirdExample = Dictionary&lt;String, Double&gt;(dictionaryLiteral: ("veggie", 14.99), ("meat", 16.99)) </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/7e1c80c4-23b9-47d2-9e27-2cbeb9a0655a.png"/></div>
            
            <p>The preceding way is just one way of creating a dictionary for our pizza diagram example.
               Let's look at a much more common way using type inference:
            </p>
            <pre>var dictPizzas = ["veggie": 14.99] </pre>
            <p>Once you add this to your code, your code should look something like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/536732c0-3348-4d23-bfe5-78e7164bd539.png"/></div>
            
            <p>This is a much simpler way to create a dictionary with an initial value. When initializing
               a dictionary, it can have any number of items. In our case, we are starting off with
               just one.
            </p>
            
            <p>Now, let's look at how we can add more pizzas into our dictionary.</p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>Let's add another item to our <kbd>dictPizzas</kbd> dictionary:
            </p>
            <pre>dictPizzas["meat"] = 17.99</pre>
            <p>Once you add this line of code, your code snippet should look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/6d1e5c5a-c17b-4960-97cb-242add0104f3.png"/></div>
            
            <p>This is the shorthand method for adding an item to a dictionary. After the dictionary
               variable, we add the key inside the brackets. Since the key for this dictionary is
               Strings, we must put this key in quotes. Next, we assign a Double to our value. Now,
               our dictionary has two items. This syntax is also used to update a dictionary item.
               Let's change the price of meat pizza to <kbd>16.99</kbd>:
            </p>
            <pre>dictPizzas["meat"] = 16.99 </pre>
            <p>Have a look at the code, it should look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/2dadf0ca-476a-443c-a183-67477a13e24a.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Instead of using the shorthand syntax, you can use the <kbd>updateValue(_:forKey:)</kbd> method. This method does almost the same thing as the shorthand syntax. If the value
               does not exist, it creates the item; if it does exist, it will update the item. The
               only difference is that, when using the <kbd>updateValue(_:forKey:)</kbd>, it actually returns the old value after performing the update. Using this method,
               you will get an optional value, because it is possible that no value exists in the
               dictionary. Let's change the value now from <kbd>16.99</kbd> to <kbd>15.99</kbd>:
            </p>
            <pre>if let oldValue = dictPizzas.updateValue(15.99, forKey: "meat") { 
  print("old value \(oldValue)") 
} </pre>
            <p>Your code should now look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/67b0e755-9bfa-4779-b700-8d2b13ec0fd0.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Since we do not need the old value, we will just use the shorthand syntax to add a
               couple more pizzas:
            </p>
            <pre>dictPizzas["specialty"] = 18.99 
dictPizzas["chicken"] = 16.99 </pre>
            <p>Your code and output should now look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/99a290ee-5922-4c9c-82ab-d4d4838a4524.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now that we have some data inside our dictionary, let's see how we can access that
               data.
            </p>

            <p>When trying to access an item inside a dictionary, you will always receive an optional
               value. The reason for this is that you could potentially receive a nil value if the
               value does not exist. So, you should always use an <kbd>if...let</kbd> statement in order to safeguard your code:
            </p>
            <pre>if let numChickenPrice = dictPizzas["chicken"] { 
  print(numChickenPrice) 
} </pre>

            <p>Just like an array, we can iterate through our dictionary; however, there are a few
               differences. Since a dictionary is unordered, each time you loop through, the values
               will never be in the same order. With dictionaries, you can loop through both the
               values and keys.
            </p>
            
            <p>Let's iterate over a dictionary's values using a <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop. Add the following into Playgrounds:
            </p>
            <pre>for value in dictPizzas.values { 
  print(value) 
} </pre>

            <p>When you need to iterate over both dictionary keys and values using a <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop, you use the following:
            </p>
            <pre>for (key, value) in dictPizzas {

            <p>In addition to keys and values, we have other useful properties. We can see the number
               of items in a dictionary using the <kbd>count</kbd> property. Let's try that by adding the following:
            </p>
            <pre>print("There are \(dictPizzas.count) total pizzas.") </pre>
            <p>Now, your code and output should look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/b1802f11-74b8-4c9b-81fa-9161e6870a9e.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Along with count, we can check whether a dictionary <kbd>isEmpty</kbd> or not. Let's use this in an <kbd>if...else</kbd> statement by adding the following:
            </p>
            <pre>if dictPizzas.isEmpty { 
  print("there are no pizzas") 
} 
else { 
  print("There are \(dictPizzas.count) total pizzas.") 
} </pre>
            <p><span>Now, your code and output should look like this:</span></p>

            <p>This kind of logic is helpful when you want to display something back to the user
               or hide a UI.

            <h1 class="header-title">Removing items from a dictionary</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Next, let's learn how to remove an item from a dictionary. When deleting items from
               a dictionary, we have two primary ways of doing this. The first uses <kbd>removeValue(forKey:)</kbd>. Let's add this right above our <kbd>if...else</kbd> statement that checks if the dictionary <kbd>isEmpty</kbd>:
            </p>
            <pre>dictPizzas.removeValue(forKey: "chicken") </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/efea94bb-7bbb-438e-989e-ed9e836c0ccb.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Let's look at the second way of removing dictionary items, the shorthand syntax. Add
               the following to Playgrounds following the <kbd>removeValue(forKey:)</kbd>:
            </p>
            <pre>dictPizzas["meat"] = nil </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/4c188068-eb0f-4558-9cbe-f7c70d472b26.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Notice that, just like with <kbd>updateValue(_:forKey:)</kbd>, <kbd>removeValue(forKey:)</kbd> will return you the value before it is removed. If you do not need the value, the
               shorthand syntax is the preferred method.
            </p>
            
            <p>So far, we covered arrays and dictionaries, and now we will review one last collection:
               sets.
            </p>

            <p>A set stores unique values of the same type in a collection without a defined order.
               Let's look at a diagram:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="274" src="assets/626d6661-f395-47b0-981d-1b533e149a75.png" width="402"/></div>
            
            <p>In the preceding diagram, we have two circles, both of which represent a set. On the
               left, we have Craig's favorite movies and on the right, we have Gabe's favorite movies.
            </p>

         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Before we create these sets, let's just create an empty set and see what that looks
               like:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/aa760614-256b-4ad3-909f-571b26fcd5cc.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In this first set, after the equals sign, we create the set and give it a data type
               of String. Then, we use the parentheses to initialize the set.
            </p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>Our first set was an empty String set, but we can create a set using an array literal.
               Let's add the following into Playgrounds:
            </p>
            <pre>let numberSet = Set&lt;Int&gt;([]) </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/17c38bd2-4877-4913-96c2-f2b4b8d1fe3b.png"/></div>
            
            <p>This preceding immutable set has a data type of Int, but in the parentheses we pass
               an empty array literal when we used the brackets.
            </p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>Now that we are familiar with the way sets are created, let's create a mutable set
               for Craig's favorite movies and one for Gabe's favorite movies. Add the following
               into Playgrounds:
            </p>
            <pre>var craigsFavMovieSet = Set&lt;String&gt;([]) 
var gabesFavMovieSet = Set&lt;String&gt;(["Fight Club", "Matrix", "Evil Dead", "Big Trouble in Little China", "Aliens", "Winter Solider", "The Illusionist", "Predator"]) </pre>
            <p><span>Now, your code should look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/41ee603c-7af3-41a1-a6b8-0d41bde8efb6.png"/></div>
            
            <p>We now have two mutable sets. The first set is created with an empty array literal
               and the second set is created with some initial values. Let's add some more items
               to both sets.
            </p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>In order to add an item into a set, we have to use the <kbd>insert()</kbd> method. Let's use that to add another movie to Gabe's favorite movies:
            </p>
            <pre>gabesFavMovieSet.insert("Terminator") 
gabesFavMovieSet </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/3c7f29e9-c839-47c0-90ba-b8e7ad3c8cb0.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now, Gabe has nine movies and Craig still has none. We added the <kbd>gabeFaveMovieSet</kbd> variable again so that we can see the contents update in the Results panel. In order
               to add multiple items into a set, we can use an array literal.
            </p>
            
            <p>Let's add 10 movies to Craig's list, as follows:</p>
            <pre>craigsFavMovieSet = ["The Pianist", "The Shawshank Redemption", "Dark Knight", "Black Swan", "Ip Man", "The Illusionist", "The Silence of the Lambs", "Winter Solider", "Green Mile", "Se7en"] </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/c68f1a98-19cd-4984-b883-3cae32580613.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Craig's set now has 10 movies. Next, let's see how we can work with sets.</p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>The first thing we can do with sets is to check if a set contains an item. Let's see
               if Craig's movie list has the movie Green Mile:
            </p>
            <pre>if craigsFavMovieSet.contains("Green Mile") { 
  print("Green Mile found") 
} </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>

            <p>In this preceding example, we used the <kbd>contains()</kbd> method in order to discover whether an item is in the set.
            </p>

            <p>If we want a list of all the movies in Gabe's list, we can use a <kbd>for...loop</kbd>. Let's see how that works:
            </p>
            <pre>for movie in gabesFavMovieSet { 
  print("Gabe's movie - \(movie)") 
} </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/6cbad11c-d862-41a6-b17d-748f409a57a9.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now that we have seen a <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop for all three collections, arrays, dictionaries, and sets, you can see that
               there are a lot of similarities. Remember, since sets come unordered, every time we
               run our <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop we will get a list in a different order. The way around this is to use the <kbd>sorted()</kbd> method. This will ensure that every time we loop through our list, it will always
               be in the same order. Let's do that on Craig's movie list:
            </p>
            <pre>for movie in craigsFavMovieSet.sorted() { 
  print("Craig's movie - \(movie)") 
} </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>

            <p>Now that we have our set sorted, let's look at the real power of using sets.</p>

            <p>In the following diagram, we see that, if we intersect both sets together, we should
               get a list of any movies they have in common:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="318" src="assets/d990084c-3e7f-46b3-9780-14d7f4e9bf3b.png" width="467"/></div>
            
            <p>We can do the same using the <kbd>intersection()</kbd> method in our code. Let's intersect both movie lists and see what happens:
            </p>
            <pre>craigsFavMovieSet.intersection(gabesFavMovieSet) </pre>
            <p><span>Your code and output should now look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/f10ed341-3565-4d64-b332-58f1dcdbff54.png"/></div>
            
            <p>We can see that the only two movies these sets have in common are <em>Winter Solider</em> and <em>The Illusionist</em>. In addition to seeing which movies the two sets have in common, we also can join
               the lists to get one consolidated list of the movies from both sets.
            </p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>If you look at the following diagram, you can see the two sets joined together:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="280" src="assets/f642f6b6-ccc4-4b55-b6d4-5652dc8053e6.png" width="411"/></div>
            
            <p>Using the <kbd>union()</kbd> method, we get a consolidated list of items with no duplicates. Let's try this in
               Playgrounds:
            </p>
            <pre>craigsFavMovieSet.union(gabesFavMovieSet) </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/65b0ec44-3488-4c33-9c48-a919f7261283.png"/></div>
            
            <p>We have a combined list of movies that includes all the movies that the two sets did
               not have in common and the two movies that were in common, but only listed once. As
               you can see, sets are really powerful and you can use them to manipulate data. Finally,
               we need to look at how you can remove items from a set.

            <p>In order to remove an item from a set, we can use the <kbd>remove()</kbd> method. When we use this method, we just input the item we want to remove in the
               parentheses. Let's remove <em>Winter Solider</em> from Craig's movie list:
            </p>
            <pre>craigsFavMovieSet.remove("Winter Solider") </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/8cae9ae0-f4de-45a0-8e93-54a458fa5a61.png"/></div>
            
            <p>If you wanted to remove more than a single item from a set (for instance, all of the
               items), then you can use the <kbd>removeAll()</kbd> method or give it an empty array literal:
            </p>
            <pre>craigsFavMovieSet.removeAll() 
gabesFavMovieSet = [] </pre>
            <p><span>Your code should now look like this:</span></p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/a1e67d5d-c0ad-42ae-ba92-1f05a81eff54.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now, both sets are empty.</p>

            <p>We covered a lot in this chapter. We now are comfortable with using collections. Now
               that you are familiar with arrays, dictionaries, and sets, take the time to practice
               and work with them as much as you can. Collections are used a ton in programming so
               getting comfortable is very important.
            </p>
            
            <p>Even though we will touch on these things throughout the creation of the <em>Let's Eat</em> app, it is best to make sure you are comfortable with what we covered here. So, please
               review as much as you need in order to make sure you feel that you are proficient
               in the topics contained in this chapter.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the next chapter, we will start building our <em>Let's Eat</em> app. Over the next two chapters, we will work on getting our project set up and then
               we will start working on the visual aspects of our app.
