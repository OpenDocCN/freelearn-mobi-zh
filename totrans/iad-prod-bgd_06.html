Creating an iAd is different, as you have an entire framework to build a mini-application, all housed within a host app. It's possible to create the same, if not better, integrated experiences in our iAd using the iAd Framework and iAd Producer.<a class="indexterm" id="id250"/>
</p><p>Think of your iAd as a microsite that you really don't ever want the user to leave. Let's explore the destinations and user actions we can achieve within our iAd, avoiding having to take users to your main site.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec02"/>Selling digital products</h1></div></div></div><p>We can sell digital products, such as songs, movies, or apps, directly in our iAd, without the user having to leave the ad or app they're in.

</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note92"/>Note</h3><p>When digital content is downloaded from your ad, you'll receive the same revenue as if it was purchased directly from the store.</p></div></div>

</p><p>We'll continue with our<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> project that we worked on in the last chapter. Open it in iAd Producer.</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Let's add an extra page to use as our<strong> Purchase</strong> page. From the ad overview, click on the plus icon, found on the lines that show the relationship between the menu and pages, as highlighted in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="Time for action — downloading an app from our ad" src="img/1321_06_01.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Double-click on the newly created page, labeled<strong> Page 4</strong>, to open the template chooser. Select the<strong> Purchase</strong> template, and then double-click on the page again to open it on the editing canvas. You'll see a placeholder product page, similar to those seen in the iOS App Store.</li><li class="listitem">If it isn't already open, open the inspector pane, and click anywhere on the canvas to select the store view object that was automatically added to the page by the template. Expand the<strong> Properties</strong> section to reveal the settings we need to configure for this page of our ad.</li><li class="listitem">You'll see that we need to provide the<strong> Country</strong> where our item is available, the<strong> Store ID</strong>, and the unique ID iTunes assigns to items, so the template knows which item we want to sell. For now, use<code class="literal"> 358992973</code> as the<strong> Store ID</strong> and select your country from the list:<a class="indexterm" id="id253"/><div><img alt="Time for action — downloading an app from our ad" src="img/1321_06_02.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">You should see the canvas update to show you the<strong> Balance Balls</strong> app. If the item doesn't appear when you select a country, try either<strong> United Kingdom</strong> or<strong> United States</strong>, as the content might not currently be available in your country. We'll look at getting the<strong> Store ID</strong> for your own content from the iTunes Store later.</li><li class="listitem">Test the ad on a device and try purchasing the item; you'll be asked to enter your iTunes account password. If you don't want to complete the transaction, tap<strong> cancel</strong> at this step. You'll be unable to download or purchase store items in the iOS Simulator as it isn't permitted to access licensed content.<a class="indexterm" id="id254"/><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note93"/>Note</h3><p>Watch out: if you're testing downloading an item that isn't free, you will be charged, even if it's your own product or content.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">As you can see, there's little that we have to do to create a great, quick, and seamless way of letting users download our content. You'd typically not style this page, as it's consistent with the purchasing experience of the iTunes and App Store. So, leave it as it is and save your iAd project.</li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec01"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>We added an extra page to our iAd, using the plus button on the ad canvas in iAd Producer. You can use the plus button to add as many pages as you want to your iAd, but try to keep the total under five to prevent your ad from being overwhelming.</p><p>Using an example<code class="literal"> Store ID</code>, we were able to let users of our iAd directly purchase or download an app from the App Store without leaving the ad. The app will download in the background and automatically appear on the device home screen of the user. Now, let's look at adding your own iTunes content to the<strong> Purchase</strong> template.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec04"/>Time for action — getting iTunes Store IDs</h1></div></div></div><p>We can get the Store IDs of items required by the<strong> Purchase</strong> template using the built-in store in iTunes:<a class="indexterm" id="id255"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">To access the iTunes Store, open iTunes. You'll find iTunes in the<code class="literal"> Applications</code> folder on your Mac. Double-click on the icon to open it.</li><li class="listitem">In the sidebar, on the left of iTunes, click on the<strong> iTunes Store</strong> item found under the<strong> Store</strong> heading, shown in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="Time for action — getting iTunes Store IDs" src="img/1321_06_03.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Find the search store text area in the top right of the main bar of iTunes. Enter the content you want to find the ID of, for example, Apple's iBooks app. Press the<em> Enter</em> key to search.<a class="indexterm" id="id256"/></li><li class="listitem">You'll now see a list of search results; find your item, click on the arrow next to the price, and select<strong> Copy Link</strong>. This will copy the link of your item to your clipboard:<div><img alt="Time for action — getting iTunes Store IDs" src="img/1321_06_04.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now, we need to paste the link so that we can extract the Store ID from it. Open TextEdit, a text editor that came with your Mac. You should be able to find it in the<code class="literal"> Applications</code> folder. Once opened, you should see a large white text area; right-click on it and choose<strong> Paste</strong>, or use the keyboard shortcut<em> cmd</em> +<em> V</em>. You'll see the link (that we just copied) appear. The link is a website URL you're able to share; it will automatically open the iTunes store when it's clicked.<a class="indexterm" id="id257"/><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip11"/>Tip</h3><p>If you can't select<strong> Paste</strong>, or if something other than the link appeared, go back to iTunes and copy the link again.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">You'll find the Store ID near the end of the link. Take, for example,<a class="ulink" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8"> http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8</a>. In this link, the ID is the string of numbers after<code class="literal"> id</code> and before<code class="literal"> ?mt=8</code>, so you would use<code class="literal"> 364709193</code> as the Store ID. Try opening the<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> project now and updating the Store ID to the iBooks ID.</li><li class="listitem">Now, let's try finding a song; go back to iTunes and search for a song, such as A beautiful mine by RJD2. From the search results, find the item you want, and copy the link. Paste the link into TextEdit; it should look similar to this:<a class="ulink" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/a-beautiful-mine/id148031770?i=148032644"> http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/a-beautiful-mine/id148031770?i=148032644</a>.<p>With songs, you're only able to offer the individual track to purchase, not the entire album, so we need the item ID of the song. The individual song ID is found after <code class="literal">i=</code>, so for this item it would be <code class="literal">148032644</code>, not the other id, which is used to identify the entire album.
</p><p>We can also offer movies to purchase, right in our ad. Copy a link for a movie, for example, <em>District 9</em>, and paste it into TextEdit. A movie link will look like <a class="ulink" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/district-9/id331251689">http://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/district-9/id331251689</a>. Like the app link, the Store ID for this movie is found after the id text at the end of the link; the ID of this item is  <code class="literal">331251689</code>. Try updating the Store ID in iAd Producer with this ID to see how the purchase template appears for movies and films.
</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note94"/>Note</h3><p>Some content, although visible in your country's iTunes Store; might not appear correctly in iAd Producer or when testing your iAd. Try updating the country to<strong> US</strong> temporarily, to fix this. If you continue to have problems, contact your Apple iTunes store agent or developer support.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Finally, books can be included—their ISBN is used as the Store ID—but the book has to be available in the iBook Store. To find a book's Store ID, for example,<em> Treasure Island</em>, copy the link and paste it into TextEdit. The link will look similar to<a class="ulink" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/treasure-island/id370190362?mt=11"> http://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/treasure-island/id370190362?mt=11</a>, with the Store ID being after<code class="literal"> id</code>, in this case,<code class="literal"> 370190362</code>.<a class="indexterm" id="id258"/></li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec02"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>We used iTunes and the iTunes Store to find the Store ID of items, which is required by the<strong> Purchase</strong> template in iAd Producer. You can use this technique whenever you need to get the ID of your own items in the store.</p><p>Depending on what digital content you have, consider offering it for free or at a discount when promoting it within your ad. Let's tweak our ad as we've inadvertently created a few inconsistencies when we added the<strong> Purchase</strong> page to it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec05"/>Time for action — fixing our ad</h1></div></div></div><p>As the menu template we used for our<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> project automatically updates whenever we add or remove pages, we don't have to do anything to update it. However, there are a few tweaks we'll need to make:<a class="indexterm" id="id259"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Continuing with our<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> project, make sure it is open in iAd Producer. Open the<strong> Purchase</strong> page on the editing canvas.</li><li class="listitem">iAd Producer has automatically named our page<strong> Purchase</strong>, which isn't particularly engaging for our user. Without any objects selected, expand the inspector and rename the page in the<strong> Properties</strong> to, say,<code class="literal"> Get the app!</code>. This uses a call to action, requesting and encouraging the user to follow your instruction.<p>In the following screenshot, you can see the <strong>Properties</strong> section and <strong>Name</strong> field:
<a class="indexterm" id="id260"/>
</p><div><img alt="Time for action — fixing our ad" src="img/1321_06_05.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Return to the ad overview and open the menu on the canvas. You'll see the text has updated to match the new name for the page, but the styling of the other buttons hasn't been applied to our new menu item. The whole menu object has also been cut off at the bottom of the screen.<a class="indexterm" id="id261"/></li><li class="listitem">Click on the menu object and drag it up on the page, so the last button isn't obscured. You may also need to resize the menu by dragging the bottom drag handle to accommodate our additional button.</li><li class="listitem">Next, we'll update the style of the button so it matches the others. With the menu selected, double-click on the first button to enter editing mode; then, click on the button again to select it. This can take a few attempts. Once selected, expand the inspector pane if it isn't already and click on<strong> Apply Style to All Buttons</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot. This duplicates the style to all other buttons in the menu so that they match and are consistent:<div><img alt="Time for action — fixing our ad" src="img/1321_06_07.jpg"/></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none">Now that our button matches the others, let's test our ad on a device or in the iOS Simulator.<a class="indexterm" id="id262"/></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">You may have noticed that we can't return from the<strong> Purchase</strong> page as the menu item is missing. It's on the page but hidden behind the purchase object on the page, so we need to send the store item to the back of the page. Open the<strong> Purchase</strong> page on the ad canvas, and click on the purchase object to select it. Right-click and choose<strong> Send to Back</strong>. The menu button should now appear.</li><li class="listitem">If you saved a style for your menu items in the last chapter, don't forget to select that style from the style presets list.</li><li class="listitem">Unfortunately, the positioning of our menu item interferes with the content of the purchase object, as you can see in the following screenshot. Let's restructure the page to accommodate it:<div><img alt="Time for action — fixing our ad" src="img/1321_06_08.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">By resizing the purchase object, we can have a dedicated area, at the bottom of our iAd, to contain the back button. Click on the purchase object, and drag the bottom drag handle so it's above the<strong> Menu</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">Now center the menu button by dragging it to the middle of the screen. Consider updating the text to<code class="literal"> Back to Menu</code> and resizing the button so it fills more of the space at the bottom of the ad.</li><li class="listitem">Change the background of the page to color fill and set it to white; this will separate the scrollable purchase object and the<strong> Back to Menu</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">Reselect the purchase object and add a drop shadow to further separate the two sections of the page.<a class="indexterm" id="id263"/></li><li class="listitem">Finally, add a build in and out animation to the button and purchase object. Make the purchase view<strong> Move In From Top</strong> on build in, and<strong> Move Out To Top</strong> for build out. Make the<strong> Menu</strong> button<strong> Move In From Bottom</strong> for the build in and<strong> Build Out To Bottom</strong> for the build out. You can find the build in and out sections in the animations pane, when you have an object selected.</li><li class="listitem">Open your iAd in the iOS Simulator or iAd Tester for your device, and check whether we're able to interact as you'd expect. Your final<strong> Purchase</strong> page should look similar to this:</li></ol></div><div><img alt="Time for action — fixing our ad" src="img/1321_06_09.jpg"/></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec03"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>As adding an extra page to our iAd project had caused some styling issues on the main menu and prevented our app navigation from working as intended, we reapplied our button style to the cells and redesigned the<strong> Purchase</strong> page to incorporate a<strong> Back to Menu</strong> button.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec04"/>Pop Quiz — digital downloads</h2></div></div></div><p>The awareness or revenue you can generate from downloadable content in your iAds can be vast, so let's check whether you're doing it right:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">How do you get a Store ID, for a digital item, required by the purchase template in iAd Producer?<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none">a.

In three taps, the user has purchased your product and it's on their iOS device. You could also create a free app for your company, offering an even richer experience than your iAd, that persists on the users home screen so they can keep reengaging with your brand.</p></div></div>

</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Open the<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> project that we've been working on in iAd Producer.

We'll adjust the offset to center the image over the blue location crosshair—change the X and Y offsets until your pin sits on the crosshair. An X Offset of around 8px and a Y Offset of 5px should work well with this image.

For example, you could do the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Add transitions to our new pages to ease the user journey through our ad.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Try adding back in the<strong> build in and out</strong> action animations that we lost when we replaced the menu with a set of buttons.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Check that all buttons have the correct styling applied to them and that tapping them takes you to the right page.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Try adding another page and creating an item on the menu for it.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Test the ad thoroughly, ideally on more than one device. Try to fix any issues that you may find.</li></ul></div><p>Once your ad is looking awesome, save it and show it off to your team, friends, and family.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec09"/>Sending a message</h1></div></div></div><p>To generate additional promotion from within our iAd, we can enable pre-composed SMS text messaging and emailing right in our ad, without the user having to leave the ad or app. Encouraging your users to share their passion for your brand or product with a friend in a few simple taps increases the reach of our ad's potential audience substantially.<a class="indexterm" id="id274"/>

</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note98"/>Note</h3><p>Remember: iAd Producer is an editor that manages most of the iAd JS library for us, although it currently doesn't support all the available features, so we occasionally have to modify and add some custom code.</p></div><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">We'll continue with our<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> project; if it isn't already open, open it now.</li><li class="listitem">Let's create a button on the<strong> Menu</strong> page so our users can share our brand with their friends. Open the<strong> Menu</strong> page on the editing canvas and add a button object from the<strong> Objects</strong> library. Change the button text to something like<code class="literal"> Tell a friend</code>, and then position the button on the bottom right of the screen. Change the button's styling. For example, try:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Setting the background to a light-to-dark, linear, red gradient</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Changing the text color to white</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adding a border radius to the button so it has rounded edges</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Including a drop shadow to add a light glow to the button</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adjusting the different button states, such as highlighted, so your button changes when tapped</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You'll probably need to reposition other objects on the page to accommodate the new button</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">You might want to make your button look like the following:<div><img alt="Time for action — sending the message" src="img/1321_06_18.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">When you're happy with the style of the button, it's time to add a tiny bit of code to add our SMS sending functionality of the ad.
