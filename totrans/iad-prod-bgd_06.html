Creating an iAd is different, as you have an entire framework to build a mini-application, all housed within a host app. It's possible to create the same, if not better, integrated experiences in our iAd using the iAd Framework and iAd Producer.<a class="indexterm" id="id250"/>
</p><p>Think of your iAd as a microsite that you really don't ever want the user to leave. Let's explore the destinations and user actions we can achieve within our iAd, avoiding having to take users to your main site.</p></div></div>

You can use the plus button to add as many pages as you want to your iAd, but try to keep the total under five to prevent your ad from being overwhelming.</p><p>Using an example<code class="literal"> Store ID</code>, we were able to let users of our iAd directly purchase or download an app from the App Store without leaving the ad. The app will download in the background and automatically appear on the device home screen of the user. Now, let's look at adding your own iTunes content to the<span class="strong"><strong> Purchase</strong></span> template.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Time for action &#x2014; getting iTunes Store IDs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec04"/>Time for action — getting iTunes Store IDs</h1></div></div></div><p>We can get the Store IDs of items required by the<span class="strong"><strong> Purchase</strong></span> template using the built-in store in iTunes:<a class="indexterm" id="id255"/>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">To access the iTunes Store, open iTunes. You'll find iTunes in the<code class="literal"> Applications</code> folder on your Mac. Double-click on the icon to open it.</li><li class="listitem">In the sidebar, on the left of iTunes, click on the<span class="strong"><strong> iTunes Store</strong></span> item found under the<span class="strong"><strong> Store</strong></span> heading, shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — getting iTunes Store IDs" src="graphics/1321_06_03.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Find the search store text area in the top right of the main bar of iTunes. Enter the content you want to find the ID of, for example, Apple's iBooks app. Press the<span class="emphasis"><em> Enter</em></span> key to search.<a class="indexterm" id="id256"/></li><li class="listitem">You'll now see a list of search results; find your item, click on the arrow next to the price, and select<span class="strong"><strong> Copy Link</strong></span>. This will copy the link of your item to your clipboard:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — getting iTunes Store IDs" src="graphics/1321_06_04.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now, we need to paste the link so that we can extract the Store ID from it. Open TextEdit, a text editor that came with your Mac. You should be able to find it in the<code class="literal"> Applications</code> folder. Once opened, you should see a large white text area; right-click on it and choose<span class="strong"><strong> Paste</strong></span>, or use the keyboard shortcut<span class="emphasis"><em> cmd</em></span> +<span class="emphasis"><em> V</em></span>. You'll see the link (that we just copied) appear. The link is a website URL you're able to share; it will automatically open the iTunes store when it's clicked.<a class="indexterm" id="id257"/><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip11"/>Tip</h3><p>If you can't select<span class="strong"><strong> Paste</strong></span>, or if something other than the link appeared, go back to iTunes and copy the link again.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">You'll find the Store ID near the end of the link. Take, for example,<a class="ulink" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8"> http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8</a>. In this link, the ID is the string of numbers after<code class="literal"> id</code> and before<code class="literal"> ?mt=8</code>, so you would use<code class="literal"> 364709193</code> as the Store ID. Try opening the<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> project now and updating the Store ID to the iBooks ID.</li><li class="listitem">Now, let's try finding a song; go back to iTunes and search for a song, such as A beautiful mine by RJD2. From the search results, find the item you want, and copy the link. Paste the link into TextEdit; it should look similar to this:<a class="ulink" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/a-beautiful-mine/id148031770?i=148032644"> http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/a-beautiful-mine/id148031770?i=148032644</a>.<p>With songs, you're only able to offer the individual track to purchase, not the entire album, so we need the item ID of the song. The individual song ID is found after <code class="literal">i=</code>, so for this item it would be <code class="literal">148032644</code>, not the other id, which is used to identify the entire album.
</p><p>We can also offer movies to purchase, right in our ad. Copy a link for a movie, for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>District 9</em></span>, and paste it into TextEdit. A movie link will look like <a class="ulink" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/district-9/id331251689">http://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/district-9/id331251689</a>. Like the app link, the Store ID for this movie is found after the id text at the end of the link; the ID of this item is  <code class="literal">331251689</code>. Try updating the Store ID in iAd Producer with this ID to see how the purchase template appears for movies and films.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note94"/>Note</h3><p>Some content, although visible in your country's iTunes Store; might not appear correctly in iAd Producer or when testing your iAd. Try updating the country to<span class="strong"><strong> US</strong></span> temporarily, to fix this. If you continue to have problems, contact your Apple iTunes store agent or developer support.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Finally, books can be included—their ISBN is used as the Store ID—but the book has to be available in the iBook Store. To find a book's Store ID, for example,<span class="emphasis"><em> Treasure Island</em></span>, copy the link and paste it into TextEdit. The link will look similar to<a class="ulink" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/treasure-island/id370190362?mt=11"> http://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/treasure-island/id370190362?mt=11</a>, with the Store ID being after<code class="literal"> id</code>, in this case,<code class="literal"> 370190362</code>.<a class="indexterm" id="id258"/></li></ol></div><div class="section" title="What just happened?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec02"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>We used iTunes and the iTunes Store to find the Store ID of items, which is required by the<span class="strong"><strong> Purchase</strong></span> template in iAd Producer. You can use this technique whenever you need to get the ID of your own items in the store.</p><p>Depending on what digital content you have, consider offering it for free or at a discount when promoting it within your ad. Let's tweak our ad as we've inadvertently created a few inconsistencies when we added the<span class="strong"><strong> Purchase</strong></span> page to it.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Time for action &#x2014; fixing our ad"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec05"/>Time for action — fixing our ad</h1></div></div></div><p>As the menu template we used for our<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> project automatically updates whenever we add or remove pages, we don't have to do anything to update it. However, there are a few tweaks we'll need to make:<a class="indexterm" id="id259"/>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Continuing with our<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> project, make sure it is open in iAd Producer. Open the<span class="strong"><strong> Purchase</strong></span> page on the editing canvas.</li><li class="listitem">iAd Producer has automatically named our page<span class="strong"><strong> Purchase</strong></span>, which isn't particularly engaging for our user. Without any objects selected, expand the inspector and rename the page in the<span class="strong"><strong> Properties</strong></span> to, say,<code class="literal"> Get the app!</code>. This uses a call to action, requesting and encouraging the user to follow your instruction.<p>In the following screenshot, you can see the <span class="strong"><strong>Properties</strong></span> section and <span class="strong"><strong>Name</strong></span> field:
<a class="indexterm" id="id260"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — fixing our ad" src="graphics/1321_06_05.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Return to the ad overview and open the menu on the canvas. You'll see the text has updated to match the new name for the page, but the styling of the other buttons hasn't been applied to our new menu item. The whole menu object has also been cut off at the bottom of the screen.<a class="indexterm" id="id261"/></li><li class="listitem">Click on the menu object and drag it up on the page, so the last button isn't obscured. You may also need to resize the menu by dragging the bottom drag handle to accommodate our additional button.</li><li class="listitem">Next, we'll update the style of the button so it matches the others. With the menu selected, double-click on the first button to enter editing mode; then, click on the button again to select it. This can take a few attempts. Once selected, expand the inspector pane if it isn't already and click on<span class="strong"><strong> Apply Style to All Buttons</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot. This duplicates the style to all other buttons in the menu so that they match and are consistent:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — fixing our ad" src="graphics/1321_06_07.jpg"/></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none">Now that our button matches the others, let's test our ad on a device or in the iOS Simulator.<a class="indexterm" id="id262"/></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">You may have noticed that we can't return from the<span class="strong"><strong> Purchase</strong></span> page as the menu item is missing. It's on the page but hidden behind the purchase object on the page, so we need to send the store item to the back of the page. Open the<span class="strong"><strong> Purchase</strong></span> page on the ad canvas, and click on the purchase object to select it. Right-click and choose<span class="strong"><strong> Send to Back</strong></span>. The menu button should now appear.</li><li class="listitem">If you saved a style for your menu items in the last chapter, don't forget to select that style from the style presets list.</li><li class="listitem">Unfortunately, the positioning of our menu item interferes with the content of the purchase object, as you can see in the following screenshot. Let's restructure the page to accommodate it:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — fixing our ad" src="graphics/1321_06_08.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">By resizing the purchase object, we can have a dedicated area, at the bottom of our iAd, to contain the back button. Click on the purchase object, and drag the bottom drag handle so it's above the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> button.</li><li class="listitem">Now center the menu button by dragging it to the middle of the screen. Consider updating the text to<code class="literal"> Back to Menu</code> and resizing the button so it fills more of the space at the bottom of the ad.</li><li class="listitem">Change the background of the page to color fill and set it to white; this will separate the scrollable purchase object and the<span class="strong"><strong> Back to Menu</strong></span> button.</li><li class="listitem">Reselect the purchase object and add a drop shadow to further separate the two sections of the page.<a class="indexterm" id="id263"/></li><li class="listitem">Finally, add a build in and out animation to the button and purchase object. Make the purchase view<span class="strong"><strong> Move In From Top</strong></span> on build in, and<span class="strong"><strong> Move Out To Top</strong></span> for build out. Make the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> button<span class="strong"><strong> Move In From Bottom</strong></span> for the build in and<span class="strong"><strong> Build Out To Bottom</strong></span> for the build out. You can find the build in and out sections in the animations pane, when you have an object selected.</li><li class="listitem">Open your iAd in the iOS Simulator or iAd Tester for your device, and check whether we're able to interact as you'd expect. Your final<span class="strong"><strong> Purchase</strong></span> page should look similar to this:</li></ol></div><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — fixing our ad" src="graphics/1321_06_09.jpg"/></div><div class="section" title="What just happened?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec03"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>As adding an extra page to our iAd project had caused some styling issues on the main menu and prevented our app navigation from working as intended, we reapplied our button style to the cells and redesigned the<span class="strong"><strong> Purchase</strong></span> page to incorporate a<span class="strong"><strong> Back to Menu</strong></span> button.</p></div><div class="section" title="Pop Quiz — digital downloads"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec04"/>Pop Quiz — digital downloads</h2></div></div></div><p>The awareness or revenue you can generate from downloadable content in your iAds can be vast, so let's check whether you're doing it right:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">How do you get a Store ID, for a digital item, required by the purchase template in iAd Producer?<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none">a.

Let's make our own custom menu and make our store finder page accessible as a hidden subpage of our ad.<a class="indexterm" id="id270"/>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">We'll be continuing with our coffee beans example; if it isn't already open, open your<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> project in iAd Producer. From the<span class="strong"><strong> Overview</strong></span>, open the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> page on the canvas. You'll see our last menu item; the store finder is cut off the page, as shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — hidden pages" src="graphics/1321_06_14.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">We could just move the menu up, but this would produce a cluttered and overwhelming initial screen to show to the user. Instead, we'll create our own navigation menu with button objects and place the map page button in the<span class="strong"><strong> Steamy Savings</strong></span> page, so it's hidden from the main menu.</li><li class="listitem">Return to<span class="strong"><strong> ad overview</strong></span> and open the<span class="strong"><strong> Steamy Savings</strong></span> page on the canvas. Before we're able to add anything to this page, we need to temporarily move the<code class="literal"> Wipe Clear</code> object off the canvas to access the page objects. Click on the<code class="literal"> Wipe Clear</code> object and drag it off the main canvas, to the left or right of the page. We'll move it back into place later, once we've edited our page.</li><li class="listitem">With the wipe clear off the canvas, select and drag<span class="strong"><strong> Voucher Codes</strong></span> and the<span class="strong"><strong> Voucher</strong></span> area further up the screen towards the coffee cup; this will create some extra room for our<span class="strong"><strong> Map</strong></span> button. If you added it earlier, select the<span class="strong"><strong> Present voucher codes in store</strong></span> text label and delete it, using the<span class="emphasis"><em> delete</em></span> or<span class="emphasis"><em> backspace</em></span> key on your keyboard; we'll replace this with a store finder button.</li><li class="listitem">Open the<span class="strong"><strong> Objects</strong></span> library and select<span class="strong"><strong> Button</strong></span>. This will add an empty button to the canvas; resize and move this button so it fits well at the bottom of our ad. Double-click on the button so you can edit the text, and update it to something such as<code class="literal"> Find a store now</code>.</li><li class="listitem">With the button selected, expand the<span class="strong"><strong> Events</strong></span> section in the inspector. Change the<span class="strong"><strong> Touched Up Inside</strong></span> drop-down to<span class="strong"><strong> Go to Page</strong></span>, then select<span class="strong"><strong> Map</strong></span>; this will cause the<span class="strong"><strong> Map</strong></span> page to open when the user taps the button:<a class="indexterm" id="id271"/><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — hidden pages" src="graphics/1321_06_15.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Preview your ad and test whether the button works as expected.</li><li class="listitem">We'll now want to update our main menu to remove the<span class="strong"><strong> Maps</strong></span> button. Unfortunately, as the menu object is automatically updated when we add new pages, removing the<span class="strong"><strong> Maps</strong></span> button will just cause it to be regenerated next time we modify a page. This means we need to build our own menu out of buttons. There are a few tricks that we can use though that'll make managing our own menu easier. Go back to the ad overview and open the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> page on the canvas.</li><li class="listitem">First, we'll save the button style of our menu as a preset so we can quickly apply it to all our own buttons. Single-click on the menu object to select it, then double click to enter the menu item editing mode; finally, click on one of the buttons in the menu to select it. Now, save the style as a preset using the<span class="strong"><strong> cog</strong></span> button, then choose<span class="strong"><strong> Save</strong></span>. Call your preset something like<code class="literal"> Main Menu Button</code>, so you'll know which style to choose later. With the button style saved, we can safely delete our menu object. Click outside of the menu object to exit the menu item editing mode, and then single-click on the menu object to select it. Press the<span class="emphasis"><em> delete</em></span> or<span class="emphasis"><em> backspace</em></span> key to remove the entire object from the canvas.<a class="indexterm" id="id272"/><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip12"/>Tip</h3><p>If the<span class="strong"><strong> Save</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> Save As…</strong></span> items are disabled, try selecting the individual button again; it's often hard to select the right item!</p></div></li><li class="listitem">As we've no longer got any form of navigation in our<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> page, open the<span class="strong"><strong> Objects</strong></span> library and click on the button object to add a new button to our canvas. From the style preset selector, update the style to your menu button style, for example<span class="strong"><strong> Main Menu Button</strong></span>. The button should now look like the one from the menu we deleted; if it doesn't, make sure you have selected the right style.</li><li class="listitem">Let's change the button's<code class="literal"> Touch Up Inside</code> event to<code class="literal"> Go To Page</code>. Then, select the page to be<code class="literal"> Bean Blender</code>, the first page of our iAd, with the same technique that we used to add a go-to target for our<span class="strong"><strong> store finder</strong></span> button. Double-click on the button and replace the text with<code class="literal"> Bean Blender</code> so it matches the go-to destination.</li><li class="listitem">Next, we'll duplicate this button to save us having to create a new button from scratch. With the button object selected, right-click on it and choose<span class="strong"><strong> Copy</strong></span>, or use the keyboard shortcut<span class="emphasis"><em> cmd</em></span> +<span class="emphasis"><em> C</em></span>. Now, right-click on the canvas and choose<span class="strong"><strong> Paste</strong></span> from the menu, or use<span class="emphasis"><em> cmd</em></span> +<span class="emphasis"><em> V</em></span> on the keyboard. Paste the button two more times so you have four buttons on the screen:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — hidden pages" src="graphics/1321_06_16.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Reposition each item so they're equally spaced on the page. Use the yellow guidelines that appear when dragging items near each other to ensure the spacing is correct, as shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — hidden pages" src="graphics/1321_06_17.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Change each item's<code class="literal"> Touch Up Inside</code> event to go to the right page and text, so each page of our ad can be accessed like before. However, don't add a button for the<span class="strong"><strong> Maps</strong></span> page.<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note97"/>Note</h3><p>You may have noticed in the ad overview that iAd Producer still shows the<span class="strong"><strong> Map</strong></span> page as being connected to the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> page. This is fine; iAd Producer assumes all of your pages are linked from the core menu page, even when you've changed it.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">With our custom menu complete, return to<span class="strong"><strong> ad overview</strong></span> and open the<span class="strong"><strong> Maps</strong></span> page. Currently, the button on our<span class="strong"><strong> Map</strong></span> page says<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> and returns the user to the menu. However, as this page is now accessed from the<span class="strong"><strong> Voucher</strong></span> page, we'll want to update the button to take them back there. Click on the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> button to select it and then change it to go to<span class="strong"><strong> Steamy Savings</strong></span>. Update the button text to<code class="literal"> Back</code> to tell the user they'll be going back to the previous page they came from, not the menu.<a class="indexterm" id="id273"/></li><li class="listitem">Open the<span class="strong"><strong> Steamy Savings</strong></span> page and reposition the<code class="literal"> Wipe Clear</code> object over the page.
