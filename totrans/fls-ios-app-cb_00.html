Every day, it seems, someone finds an innovative use for it and, in the App Store, the perfect outlet for their work. Its success has made apps cool and helped shift delivery of content away from the browser. Adobe has reacted to this change by repositioning the Flash platform, and providing the tools required for the creation and publication of native iOS applications directly from Flash Professional.</p><p>The<span class="strong"><strong> Flash iOS Apps Cookbook</strong></span> is a culmination of my experience working with AIR for iOS since its beginnings. I have paid particular attention to the fundamentals, focusing on the groundwork that many newcomers find daunting. For those with a firm grasp of the basics, there is plenty to learn, from working with the device's many sensors, to maximizing the performance of graphics using hardware acceleration.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will have acquired the necessary skills to write and distribute your own native iOS applications using Flash. I hope that you will use what you have learned here to create beautiful applications that befit the talented and inspiring community you are about to become a part of.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
