<p>Android was first released in 2007 after being acquired by Google, Inc. Initially, Android was primarily used on a handset. Android 3.0 added features to take advantage of the growing tablet market.</p>
<p>In 2014, Google announced Android had over 1 billion active users! With over 1 million applications available on Google Play, there's never been a more exciting time to join the Android community!</p>
<p>This year, 2018, marks a significant milestone for Android - 10 year anniversary since the first Android phone was released! And with that, we have a new OS version release as well - Android Pie. In this new edition of the book, we'll cover features released for the platform in several new topics across many chapters, as well as updates to existing popular topics to cover SDK changes. As usual, the Android platform is constantly changing!</p>

<p>This book assumes basic familiarity with programming concepts and Android fundamentals. Or, if you are new to Android and learn best by jumping into the code, this book provides a wide range of the most common tasks. If you are new to Android, you can start at the beginning of the book and work your way through the topics as they build on previous knowledge.</p>
<p>As a cookbook, the topics are designed to be stand-along (with noted exceptions), to make it easy to jump to a particular topic and get the code working in your own application as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">&lt;activity<br/>    android:name=".MainActivity"<br/>    android:label="@string/app_name"&gt;<br/>    &lt;intent-filter&gt;<br/>        &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/&gt;<br/><br/>            &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/&gt;<br/>    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;<br/>&lt;/activity&gt;</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
