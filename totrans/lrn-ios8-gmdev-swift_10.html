We have put in our time and effort and made this awesome game. Now, we want the world to know about our creation.</p><p>The road to publishing a game is actually quite straightforward, provided you follow the steps correctly. Just as we created a developer profile so that we can run the game on the device, we also need to create a publisher profile in order to publish the game on the App Store or run it on any device other than our own.</p><p>The next step will be to create the app in the iTunesConnect portal. This is where you will give the app a name, a description, an icon, and screenshots. Finally, you will upload the app file from the system to the App Store.</p><p>You will also have the opportunity to decide whether you want to give the game away for free or charge a price.</p><p>Although achievements and leaderboards are not covered in this book, you can definitely add them to the game, along with ads, so that you can monetize the game.</p><p>So, let's get started with getting the game ready for being published. Here's what you will learn in this chapter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Getting the app ready</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Distribution certificate</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The iTunesConnect portal</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating the app</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ad hoc installation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">References</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Alternatives</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Final remarks</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Getting Ms. tinyBazooka ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec90"/>Getting Ms. tinyBazooka ready</h1></div></div></div><p>First, we will make some<a id="id737" class="indexterm"/> changes to the app. Click on the project root and then on the information screen of the project. Here, change the bundle identifier by double-clicking on the area adjacent to it. For example, I changed the bundle name to <code class="literal">com.growlgamesstudio.Ms.TinyBazooka</code>. Also, change the bundle name to reflect the name of the game; otherwise, the name of the project will be displayed, which we don't want.</p><p>Make sure that the bundle version is set to <code class="literal">1.0</code>. This is the release version. Later, when you make updates to the game, you will need to change the number for every new update you make. The rest of the items can remain as default.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_01.jpg" alt="Getting Ms. tinyBazooka ready"/></div><p>Next, we will change the icons so that instead of the default icon, we can use our own icon for the game. In the project directory in the hard disk, navigate to the <code class="literal">images.xcassets</code> folder and replace the <code class="literal">AppIcon.appiconset</code> folder, which is the one currently present, with the one provided in the resources folder of the chapter.</p><p>Now, if you build the game, the name will reflect properly, along with the new icon that you have provided.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_02.jpg" alt="Getting Ms. tinyBazooka ready"/></div><p>This will also be reflected<a id="id738" class="indexterm"/> in your project if you click on <span class="strong"><strong>AppIcon</strong></span> in the <code class="literal">images.xcassets</code> folder in your project.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_03.jpg" alt="Getting Ms. tinyBazooka ready"/></div><p>This has the icons specified for all iOS devices. So later, when I want to make a universal app, I don't have to specify icons for the different iPhone and iPod devices.</p><p>Finally, we will also change the launch image, which shows a white screen as of now, with the name of the game and some copyright information. Click on the project root. In the <span class="strong"><strong>General</strong></span> tab, which is under the <span class="strong"><strong>App Icons and Launch Images</strong></span> section, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Use Assets Catalog</strong></span> button next to <span class="strong"><strong>Launch Image source</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_04.jpg" alt="Getting Ms. tinyBazooka ready"/></div><p>Next, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Migrate</strong></span>. Then, click on the small arrow pointing to the right to the launch image dropdown:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_05.jpg" alt="Getting Ms. tinyBazooka ready"/></div><p>This will take you to the <a id="id739" class="indexterm"/>launch image in the assets catalog. Since we are developing only for iPad landscape mode, we can drag-and-drop the background images into the <span class="strong"><strong>1x</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>2x</strong></span> slots of the landscape section. Make sure that the <span class="strong"><strong>Launch Screen File</strong></span> field is empty in <span class="strong"><strong>App Icons Source</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Launch Images Source</strong></span>.</p><p>Finally, we will remove the debug information that shows the number of nodes added and the FPS. So, go to the <code class="literal">GameViewController</code> class and comment or delete these two lines:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">// Configure the view.
let skView = self.view as SKView
//skView.showsFPS = true // comment this line
//skView.showsNodeCount = true //Comment this line</pre></div><p>Now, when you launch the game, you <a id="id740" class="indexterm"/>will see the background image instead of the other white background. The app will show the proper icon, and the debug information will be removed.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Generating the distribution certificate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec91"/>Generating the distribution certificate</h1></div></div></div><p>To distribute the app, we need the <a id="id741" class="indexterm"/>distribution certificate. This is included with all the apps that are released on the App Store because without it, an app cannot be installed on any device.</p><p>For getting the distribution certificate, the steps are similar to setting up the developer certificate. Go to the<a id="id742" class="indexterm"/> Apple developer portal and sign in with the developer account you created in the first chapter at <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action">https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action</a>.</p><p>On the right-hand side of the screen, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Certificates, identifiers and profiles</strong></span> link under <span class="strong"><strong>iOS Developer Program</strong></span>. Then, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Certificates</strong></span>. Next, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> sign in the top-right corner of the screen.</p><p>In the next screen, select <span class="strong"><strong>App Store and AdHoc</strong></span> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span>. In the next step, create a<a id="id743" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Certificate Signing Request</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CSR</strong></span>) file, as the portal requires it to be uploaded to it. Go to Launchpad, search for <code class="literal">KeyChain</code>, and open it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_06.jpg" alt="Generating the distribution certificate"/></div><p>Then, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>KeyChainAccess</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Certificate Assistant</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Request a Certificate Authority</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_07.jpg" alt="Generating the distribution certificate"/></div><p>Enter your e-mail <a id="id744" class="indexterm"/>address and name, select <span class="strong"><strong>Saved to disk</strong></span>, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span>. Save the file on the desktop in the next step.</p><p>On the developer website, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span>. In the next step, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Choose file</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Generate</strong></span>. Next, download the certificate created. Double-click on the file after the download to install the certificate.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_08.jpg" alt="Generating the distribution certificate"/></div><p>On the website, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Done</strong></span>. Now we are ready distribute the game.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="The iTunesConnect portal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec92"/>The iTunesConnect portal</h1></div></div></div><p>To create the app, we will <a id="id745" class="indexterm"/>need to go to the iTunesConnect portal. In the developer portal, click on the iTunesConnect link, or<a id="id746" class="indexterm"/> go to <a class="ulink" href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com">https://itunesconnect.apple.com</a>.</p><p>You might be asked to sign in, so do it using the developer ID and password.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_09.jpg" alt="The iTunesConnect portal"/></div><p>Once in, you should see a page like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_10.jpg" alt="The iTunesConnect portal"/></div><p>The various parts of this <a id="id747" class="indexterm"/>page are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>My Apps</strong></span>: This is where we will create new apps and update existing apps</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sales and Trends</strong></span>: This will show the number of units of each app you have sold over a period of time. You can check the sales per territory, platform, category, content type, transaction type, and so on.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Payment and Financial Reports</strong></span>: Here, you will get a report of the summary of the items sold, earnings, amount owed by Apple, and payments made by Apple to you:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_11.jpg" alt="The iTunesConnect portal"/></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>iAds</strong></span>: Apple has its own ad network from which you can pool and show ads in your game. You have to use the iAds workbench to configure iAds.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Users and Roles</strong></span>: Here, information regarding the roles of individuals involved with the account can be updated. The person who created the Apple ID needs to input their details here.

You will also be providing your banking information here so that when you create a paid app, you can be paid for the sale of the app. The <span class="strong"><strong>Tax</strong></span> section will have tax forms that will need to be filled in. Primarily, there are forms for US, Canada, and Australia, depending on your location. If you are not from any of these three countries, then you will need to fill in the US tax forms.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_12.jpg" alt="The iTunesConnect portal"/></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Resources and Help</strong></span>: Here, you <a id="id748" class="indexterm"/>have links to resources such as forums and FAQs that you can refer to if you need answers to any questions.

<div class="section" title="Creating the app"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec93"/>Creating the app</h1></div></div></div><p>To create a new app, in the <span class="strong"><strong>My Apps</strong></span> section, click <a id="id749" class="indexterm"/>on the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> sign in the top-left corner of the page. Then, click on <span class="strong"><strong>New iOS App</strong></span>, as shown in this screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_13.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>The following window will open up:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_14.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>The various parts of this page are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Name</strong></span>: This is the name of the app as it will appear in the App Store. If the name you are suggesting has already been taken, then you will need to give an alternate name and also change it in the info file in Xcode.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Version</strong></span>: This needs<a id="id750" class="indexterm"/> to be the same as the version number you provided in the information in the project. Since our game is Version 1.0, we type in this value.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Primary Language</strong></span>: Choose the language used in the game. You can choose English.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>SKU</strong></span>: This is the stock keeping unit number you need to provide. You can enter <code class="literal">001</code>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Bundle ID</strong></span>: This is what the app will be recognized by on the app store. We need to register the <code class="literal">com.growlgamesstudio.Ms.TinyBazook</code> bundle ID in the developer portal so that when we upload the app to iTunesConnect, it will link up the app to the bundle ID.</li></ul></div><p>Click on the developer portal link under the Bundle ID drop-down menu.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_15.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>In <span class="strong"><strong>App Id Description</strong></span>, type a name for the app; this is just for reference. Next, in <span class="strong"><strong>App ID Suffix</strong></span>, type the app bundle ID exactly as you typed in the info. So, in this case, I have to type <code class="literal">com.growlgamesstudio.Ms.TinyBazooka</code>. Once again, this is unique for each app.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_16.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span> to proceed. On the next page, after confirming your app ID, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Submit</strong></span>. The registration is now complete. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Done</strong></span> at the bottom of the window.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_17.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>You will now see that <a id="id751" class="indexterm"/>the bundle ID has been added to <span class="strong"><strong>App IDs</strong></span> under <span class="strong"><strong>Identifiers</strong></span> in the developer portal.</p><p>Go back to the <span class="strong"><strong>App Creation</strong></span> window and in the <span class="strong"><strong>BundleID</strong></span> drop-down list, you will be able to select the tinyBazooka bundle ID. Select it and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Submit</strong></span>. This might take a couple of minutes to update and reflect in the drop-down menu.</p><p>You will now be greeted with the app page. Here, we will add the description and screenshots, and upload the binary file. Next to the <span class="strong"><strong>Submit for Review</strong></span> button, there is a <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> button, which will light up whenever you make a change. The <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> button is your friend, so use it as often as possible so that you don't lose any changes that you make.</p><p>First, we will add some screenshots. You can create a screenshot from your device by clicking on the power and home buttons at the same time on the device. Take five screenshots, plug the device into the Mac, and transfer the images to the desktop. Then you can drag the files from the desktop to the space on the iTunes app page. You can drag-and-drop each file separately or all files at the same time. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>iPad</strong></span> tab at the top, as we are developing the <a id="id752" class="indexterm"/>game only for the iPad, for now.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_18.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>Next, we will have to provide the name of the app as it will appear on the App Store. So, in the <span class="strong"><strong>Name</strong></span> section, type the name of the app:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_19.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>We will have to provide a small description of the game. We can highlight the genre, story, and pretty much anything we want to tell users about the app here. You can keep it as long or as short as you want.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_20.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>To the right of the <a id="id753" class="indexterm"/>description, we can provide keywords, support, marketing, and privacy policy URLs. Keywords, the description, and the title are parts of the ranking algorithm, so do good research to make sure that your game gets ranked higher.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_21.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>Next, we need to upload the icon for the app. The icon shouldn't have rounded corners and alpha. It would also better to have higher resolution; 1024 x 1024 would be ideal. A sample icon has been provided in the <code class="literal">Resources</code> folder for you to test. Drag the icon into the <span class="strong"><strong>App Icon</strong></span> slot.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_22.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>Now, we have to <a id="id754" class="indexterm"/>select the main the category for the app. You can select up to two subcategories. For the main category, choose <span class="strong"><strong>Games</strong></span>. The subcategory mainly depends on the genre of the game. Here, I have chosen <span class="strong"><strong>Action and Arcade</strong></span> as subcategories.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_23.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>Next, we have to specify <a id="id755" class="indexterm"/>the rating for the game. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Ratings</strong></span> section, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> link:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_24.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>Rate each of the items <a id="id756" class="indexterm"/>as <span class="strong"><strong>None</strong></span> if the content described doesn't appear at all in the game. If it does, then select either infrequent or very frequent. Depending on this, the game will be rated for a suitable audience. So, if your target audience is kids, then it should be <span class="strong"><strong>None</strong></span> for the first section and <span class="strong"><strong>No</strong></span> for the last two items ideally. This will make the game rated for ages 4 and above. Otherwise, you are targeting either a teen or an adult audience, so choose carefully.</p><p>Next, under <span class="strong"><strong>Edit License Agreement</strong></span>, the standard end user license agreement is selected by default. Otherwise, you can include a custom license:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_25.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>Now, we have to upload the build of the game. So, open the game in Xcode. Once Xcode opens, on the top menu, select <span class="strong"><strong>Product</strong></span> and then <span class="strong"><strong>Archive</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_26.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>Once the app is archived, the following window will open up. If it doesn't, you can also access it by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Organizer</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Archives</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_27.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>Notice that the<a id="id757" class="indexterm"/> identifiers and version number match what we input when we created the app in iTunesConnect. This is important because the bundle cannot be uploaded otherwise. To upload the build, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Submit</strong></span> button to the right.</p><p>Next, Xcode will check for the team for provisioning profile. If you are an individual, your account name will show up as shown in the following screenshot. Select it and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Choose</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_28.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>Next, the <span class="strong"><strong>Send App to Apple</strong></span> window will pop up. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Submit</strong></span>. Now the archive bundle will be built and it will be uploaded to Apple.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_29.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>This might take <a id="id758" class="indexterm"/>5-25 minutes, depending on the time of the year and your Internet connection's upload speed. During Christmas and other holidays, it might take even longer because a lot of developers will be uploading their apps, so it is better to think ahead and upload in advance.</p><p>Once the binary is uploaded, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Done</strong></span>. If you get some errors, don't be alarmed. Fix the errors that are mentioned, create a new archive, and upload a new binary.</p><p>Now, go back to the app page on iTunesConnect. Under the <span class="strong"><strong>Add Build</strong></span> section, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>+ </strong></span>sign on the left, select the build that you have just uploaded, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Done</strong></span> in the pop-up window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_30.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>Next, in the <span class="strong"><strong>App Review Information</strong></span> heading, add your contact information. Include your name, e-mail address, and contact information.</p><p>Under <span class="strong"><strong>Version Release</strong></span>, you can select either <span class="strong"><strong>Automatically</strong></span> releasing the version or <span class="strong"><strong>Manually Releasing</strong></span> the game.</p><p>If you select <span class="strong"><strong>Automatically</strong></span> releasing, the app will be released as soon it passes the review process. In the <a id="id759" class="indexterm"/>manual release, you can provide a date on which the app will be released. So, even if the app passes the review, it will still not be released until the release date.</p><p>Next, we have to specify the pricing for the game. At the top, select <span class="strong"><strong>Pricing</strong></span>. Here, you can select the date you want to release your app on and the pricing tier for the app.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_31.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>If you have selected automatic release, then you don't have to specify the date. For pricing, you can select from any of the tiers provided or you can select free. To create a paid app, you have to update the banking information in the <span class="strong"><strong>Banking and Taxation</strong></span> heading.</p><p>After selecting the pricing, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> at the bottom of the screen. Next, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Submit for Review</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_32.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>If your app includes an <a id="id760" class="indexterm"/>encryption, a third-party application or advertisements, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Yes</strong></span>, or else select <span class="strong"><strong>No</strong></span>. Then, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Submit</strong></span>.</p><p>Congratulations! You have successfully submitted your app for review. The status of the app will change to <span class="strong"><strong>Waiting for Review</strong></span>. It usually takes 5-7 days for an app to be reviewed by Apple's app review team, so sit back and hold tight. You will receive an e-mail saying whether your app is accepted or rejected.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_33.jpg" alt="Creating the app"/></div><p>If the app is accepted, it will appear in the App Store shortly. If the app is rejected, don't worry! You will be able to rectify the errors and submit the app again for review. It will again take about a week for it to be reviewed. So, when making apps, make sure that you avoid making errors in the upload. Also prepare more in advance when you want to release your app on the App Store.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating an ad hoc app"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec94"/>Creating an ad hoc app</h1></div></div></div><p>You can build the game to<a id="id761" class="indexterm"/> a device by connecting it to the machine, but what if a friend or a client would like to run the app on their device and they live somewhere else? For that, you can create an ad hoc app. The steps are quite similar to creating and publishing on the App Store; it's just that this time, you will need to provide the device IDs on which the app can run.</p><p>So first, we need to add the device ID of the device on which we want to run the app. The device ID is a unique number, which is specific to a particular device. So, if your friend has an iPad and an iPhone and he would like to run it on both the devices, then you will need to ask for both the device IDs from him. The device ID is also a <a id="id762" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>user device ID</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UDID</strong></span>).</p><p>To get the UDID, connect the device to the Mac and open iTunes. In the summary under <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span>, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Serial Number</strong></span> to reveal the UDID of the device:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_34.jpg" alt="Creating an ad hoc app"/></div><p>You can also go to <span class="strong"><strong>Devices</strong></span> under <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> in Xcode and select the device to show the UDID of the device:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_35.jpg" alt="Creating an ad hoc app"/></div><p>So, once you get the <a id="id763" class="indexterm"/>UDID from your friend, open the Apple Developer Portal. Go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Certificates, Identifiers and Profiles</strong></span> section. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Devices</strong></span> in the panel on the left side.</p><p>Once it opens, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> sign in the top-right corner of the page.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_36.jpg" alt="Creating an ad hoc app"/></div><p>In the <span class="strong"><strong>Name</strong></span> section, type the name of the friend and their device, enter the UDID directly below it, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Continue</strong></span>. Repeat the process to add the UDID for the other device.</p><p>You can also upload a file with the UDID and register all devices at once by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Register Multiple Devices</strong></span> and uploading the file. In any case, note that Apple will let you register up to 100 devices. So, it is more suitable for testing your game with testers.</p><p>Now, open up the project on Xcode.

<div class="section" title="Alternative frameworks/engines"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec96"/>Alternative frameworks/engines</h1></div></div></div><p>For <a id="id770" class="indexterm"/>SpriteKit and <a id="id771" class="indexterm"/>2D game development, there are a couple of alternatives. Once you create a game using SpriteKit and if it becomes a hit, you would obviously want to bring it to other platforms as well, such as Android and Windows Phone.</p><p>For cross-platform game development, you have Cocos2d and Coco2d-x. With Cocos2d, you can develop games for iOS and Android, simultaneously. You can develop your game in either Objective-C or Swift. Once you've understood development using SpriteKit, you will notice that the syntax is pretty similar, so you will feel right at home.</p><p>Industry professionals have used Cocos2d for a very long time to develop stellar games. It is open source and completely free. It has a good community, where you can ask questions to help find answers for your problems, and it is regularly updated. If you are interested, you can <a id="id772" class="indexterm"/>access it at <a class="ulink" href="http://cocos2d.spritebuilder.com/">http://cocos2d.spritebuilder.com/</a>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_45.jpg" alt="Alternative frameworks/engines"/></div><p>Like Cocos2d, Cocos2d-x<a id="id773" class="indexterm"/> is<a id="id774" class="indexterm"/> also completely open source <a id="id775" class="indexterm"/>and free and supports cross-platform game development. With Cocos2d-x, you can develop games for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, PC, Mac, Linux, and more.</p><p>You can create two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional games, using Cocos2d-x.</p><p>In order to develop games with Cocos2d-x, you are required to know C++. But there is also Cocos2d-js, which uses JavaScript as its development language. By using it, you can even develop a game for the Web. It can be <a id="id776" class="indexterm"/>downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/">http://www.cocos2d-x.org/</a>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04014_10_46.jpg" alt="Alternative frameworks/engines"/></div><p>For three-dimensional<a id="id777" class="indexterm"/> game development engines, you can take a look at Unity and<a id="id778" class="indexterm"/> Unreal Engine. You can develop games for 2D as well using the engine.</p><p>Unity uses JavaScript, C#, and Boo as its languages for development, and Unreal uses C++. At GDC, both of these frameworks are completely <a id="id779" class="indexterm"/>free to use, so I really recommend <a id="id780" class="indexterm"/>checking them out at <a class="ulink" href="http://unity3d.com/5">http://unity3d.com/5</a> and <a class="ulink" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">https://www.unrealengine.com/</a>.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Final remarks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec97"/>Final remarks</h1></div></div></div><p>By now, I am hoping that you have got a good foundation for developing 2D and 3D games with Swift, SpriteKit and SceneKit. I also hope that you have gained some basic understanding of graphics programming with Metal.</p><p>With these tools, you should be able to develop and publish your games on the iOS store. This is the first step; there is more to learn about each of these frameworks, if you want to make better looking games.</p><p>With my experience in Swift, SpriteKit and SceneKit, I can say that both Swift and SceneKit were only introduced iOS 8 and Xcode 6. This is definitely a good start for Apple, and I hope that with the next version, these will be improved upon. As and when more people start accepting and using Swift and SceneKit, there will be a much bigger developer community that you will be able to take help from and be part of. This is just like SpriteKit, which is widely used by hobbyists and enthusiasts.</p><p>If you have any questions, would like an expert opinion, or would simply like to share your creations, you can mail me by visiting the <span class="strong"><strong>Contact Me</strong></span> section of my company website.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec98"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>So, in this final chapter, we saw how to prepare our app for publishing and create the publishing license. You learned about the iTunesConnect portal, created an app in it, and finally published the app on the iOS store. At the end, we saw how to create an ad hoc build of the game that can be run on a specific device.</p><p>I had a wonderful time writing this book. Along the way, I myself learned a lot about these technologies and game development in general. I hope that you will enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed bringing it to you.</p><p>Happy game developing!</p></div></body></html>
