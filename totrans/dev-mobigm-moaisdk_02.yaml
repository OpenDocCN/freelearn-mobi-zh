    in order to have a fully working environment to develop in with Moai SDK.

    the process is more complicated and we can't cover it here, but you'll find more
    information about it in this chapter as well. At the end of the chapter, you should
    end up with a working copy of Moai SDK installed on your system.

    such as a debugger, you'd need to use one of the IDE's that support Moai SDK.
    There are a bunch of them, each with different levels of integration. For a complete
    list, I suggest you visit *Tools that work with Moai* on Moai's wiki at [http://getmoai.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tools_that_work_with_Moai](http://getmoai.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tools_that_work_with_Moai).

- en: In this book we'll focus on using ZeroBrane Studio, since it's open source (you
    can program it in Lua) and has a lot of neat features that will be useful to us
    (syntax highlighting, autocompletion for Moai SDK, debugging, and live coding,
    among others). To install it, go to [http://studio.zerobrane.com](http://studio.zerobrane.com)
    and download the latest version of the software for your specific platform.

    host for GNU/Linux. So the only option is to build your own host from the source
    code. In order to do this, you'll need some understanding of how to compile C++
    and how to handle the Git repositories (at least how to clone them).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we've seen that in order to develop with Moai SDK, we need
    to use one of the precompiled hosts or build one from source (in the case of the
    Linux development this is mandatory, since there are no precompiled builds yet).

    a sample to see if it's working properly.

    keep reading if you want to learn about Moai's runtime, the Action Tree, and Node
    Graph.
