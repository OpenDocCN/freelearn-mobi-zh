- en: Everyone you know has a smart mobile device of some kind. You probably own several
    too! The general idea of having utility applications on a phone is not new. Even
    cell phone and PDA games have existed for years, but the way that iPhone used
    touch instead of a stylus or keyboard and the way it used gestures to reduce the
    number of steps to do something was a game changer.

    2008\. If you wanted to create something that worked on both platforms, you''d
    had to learn two development environments and languages: Objective-C for iPhone
    and Java for Android.'

- en: In the desktop world, there are several development tools that allow you to
    publish apps on both Mac and Windows as well as Linux in the case of LiveCode.
    The most successful of these tools are Adobe Director, Adobe Flash, Unity, and
    LiveCode. Publishing apps to iOS was introduced with Adobe Director 12, which
    means that all four tools are also suitable for mobile development.

- en: These tools have different strengths; in some cases, the strengths relate to
    the nature of the applications you can make and in other cases, they relate to
    how accessible the tool is to people who are not hardcode programmers. If you
    want to make a high-quality 3D game, Unity would be the best choice, with Director
    and then Flash as other choices. If you need a lot of character animations, Flash
    would be the best choice, Adobe Director being a good alternate.

- en: If the most important thing for you is how approachable the tool is, then LiveCode
    wins easily. It's also a valid choice to make the majority of apps you might wish
    to make. In fact, for apps that are a set of single screens, as would be the case
    for most utility apps as well as board and puzzle games, LiveCode is better suited
    than other tools. It also has better access to native interface elements; with
    the other tools, you usually have to create graphics that resemble the look of
    native iOS and Android controls instead of accessing the real thing.

- en: With its easy-to-use near-English programming language and the stack of cards
    metaphor, LiveCode lets you concentrate more on creating the app you want to make
    and less on the technicalities of the development environment.

    Fundamentals*, introduces you to the LiveCode environment and to its near-English
    programming language. Experienced LiveCode users can skip this chapter, but for
    someone new to LiveCode, this chapter will take you through the process of creating
    a simple calculator app as a way to make you familiar with the various tools and
    hierarchy of LiveCode.'

    Mac or PC, iOS and/or Android devices, and some money if you follow the parts
    about signing up as a mobile developer in this book! For iOS development, you
    will need access to a Mac OS for some of the steps and these steps also require
    it to be an Intel-based Mac.
