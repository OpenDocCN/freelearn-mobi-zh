- en: Announced by Apple in the summer of 2010, an iAd allows you to directly target
    customers with amazingly interactive ads integrated into applications purchased
    on the App Store. Each iAd begins as a small exciting banner on a user's personal
    device that once activated bursts to fill the screen, giving you, the advertiser,
    a chance to craft a deeply immersive experience.

    for your iAd to be shown, with the banner sitting at the bottom of the screen

    nearly all mobile adverts take you out of the application you're currently in
    and make it impossible to easily get back to where you just were. Typically, the
    user is pushed out of the app into the mobile browser, to a webpage that often
    isn't meant for mobile and lacks interaction and responsiveness for the user.

    a user's app, not an interactive ad built into the core operating system.

    app than go into the mobile browser and use a search engine. Context-aware applications
    are becoming the way users find things on mobile. Your iAd intelligently positions
    itself in these applications, providing relevant, contextual, and exciting marketing
    opportunities.
