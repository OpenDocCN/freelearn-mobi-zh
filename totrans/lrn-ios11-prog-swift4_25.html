            <p>Notifications were first launched in 2009 and are a staple of the iOS system. Whether
               from your favorite app or a text message, you have encountered a notification at some
               point while using a smartphone. Pre-iOS 10, if you had to work with notifications
               in iOS, you had two types of push notifications: remote (from a server) and local.
            </p>
            
            <p>iOS 10 made changes to notifications that simplified them, but also made them more
               robust. In iOS 10, there is now one notification that covers both remote and local
               notifications, which is great for those who have worked with them in the past. Concerning
               breadth of functionality, notifications now allow you to embed rich media (such as
               images, video, and audio), as well as having custom UI content.
            </p>
            
            <p>In this chapter, we are going to learn how to create basic notifications, as well
               as notifications with embedded images. After we look at both of these examples, we
               also look at how to create a custom UI for our notifications.
            </p>
            
            <p>What we will cover in this chapter:</p>

            <p>Let's begin by getting our app to send us basic notifications. Inside of our restaurant
               details page, we have three buttons (<span class="packt_screen">9:30 PM</span>, <span class="packt_screen">10:00 PM</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">10:30 PM</span>) that currently do not do anything. We are going to update those buttons so that,
               when you tap on one of them, it creates a restaurant reservation notification. If
               this were a real reservations app, we would want to store these reservations. When
               the reservation date and time neared, we would then post a notification to the user
               as a reminder. Doing all of that is beyond the scope of this book; so, we will just
               address creating a restaurant reservation notification.

         <article>
            
            
            <p>Before we can send any notifications, we must get the user's permission. Therefore,
               open the <kbd>AppDelegate.swift</kbd> file and add the following method after the <kbd>didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()</kbd> method:
            </p>
            <pre>func checkNotifications() {<br/>   UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .b adge]) { (isGranted, error) in<br/>   }<br/>}</pre>
            <p>This method here checks for the user's authorization. If the user has not been asked,
               it displays a message to the user for permission to use notifications. When you add
               this method, you will get an error. The reason for this error is that we need to <kbd>import UserNotifications</kbd>. At the top of the file, under <kbd>import UIKit</kbd>, add the following:
            </p>
            <pre>import UserNotifications</pre>
            <p>Next, the method we just added needs to run inside of the <kbd>applicationDidFinishLaunching(application:launchOptions)</kbd> method. Add the following after <kbd>setupDefaultColors()</kbd>:
            </p>
            <pre>checkNotifications()</pre>
            <p>Your <kbd>applicationDidFinishLaunching(application:launchOptions)</kbd> method should now look like the following:
            </p>
            <pre>func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -&amp;gt; Bool {<br/>   setupDefaultColors()<br/>   checkNotifications()<br/>   return true<br/>}</pre>
            <p>Build and run the project by hitting the Play button (or using ⌘ + <em>R</em>), and you should see the following message:
            </p>

            <p>Now that we have permission, we need to set up notifications. We start setting up
               our buttons:

               <li>Select the Connections inspector in the Utilities panel and, under <kbd>Received Actions</kbd>, you see <kbd>onTimeTappedWithSender</kbd>:

            <p>Now that we have a time, let's show our notification along with the time selected:</p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>In the <kbd>RestaurantDetailViewController.swift</kbd> file, after <kbd>import LetsEatDataKit</kbd>, add the following:

               <li>Next, inside of the <kbd>showNotification()</kbd> method, add the following:

            <ol start="3">
               
               <li>After the <kbd>initialize()</kbd> method, add the following method:

            <ol start="4">
               
               <li>Let's do that now by creating an extension at the end of this file, after the last
                  curly brace. You may already have an extension in this file for our map if you tackled
                  the challenges at the end of <a href="08517443-a8a5-49e8-9b03-9d29359beac5.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Designing Static Tables</em>; if so, add this new extension after the last curly brace of that <kbd>Map</kbd> extension. In either case, add the following code: 
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            <pre style="padding-left: 60px">extension RestaurantDetailViewController: UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {<br/>   func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, willPresent notification: UNNotification, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -&amp;gt; Void) {<br/>          completionHandler([.alert, .sound])<br/>   }<br/>}</pre>
            <ol start="5">
               
               <li>Finally, we just need to call the <kbd>setupNotificationDefaults()</kbd> method inside of our <kbd>initialize()</kbd> method. Your updated <kbd>initialize()</kbd> method should now look like the following:

            <pre style="padding-left: 60px">func initialize() {<br/>   setupLabels()<br/>   setupMap()<br/>   setupNotificationDefaults()<br/>}</pre>
            <ol start="6">
               
               <li>Build and run the project by hitting the Play button (or using ⌘ + <em>R</em>). Open a restaurant detail page, tap the time button, and wait five seconds. You
                  should see the following:

            <ol start="7">

            <p>We just implemented a basic notification; however, we can do so much more. Next, let's
               get an image inside of our notification.

            <p>Replace the deleted section of code with the following code:</p>
            <pre>do {<br/>   let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "sample-restaurant-img@3x", withExtension: "png")<br/>   if let imgURL = url {<br/>          let attachment = try UNNotificationAttachment(identifier: "letsEatReservation", url: imgURL, options: nil)<br/>          content.attachments = [attachment]<br/>          let trigger = UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger(timeInterval: 5, repeats: false)<br/>          let identifier = "letsEatReservation"<br/>          let request = UNNotificationRequest(identifier: identifier, content: content, trigger: trigger)<br/>          UNUserNotificationCenter.current().add(request, withCompletionHandler: { error in<br/>                 // handle error<br/>          })<br/>   }<br/>}<br/>catch {<br/>   print("there was an error with the notification")<br/>}</pre>
            <p>In this <kbd>do...catch</kbd>, we are getting the image URL from our project and creating an attachment. We attach
               the rich media (here, an image) to the notification. The rest of the code is what
               we removed and just added back inside of the <kbd>do...catch</kbd>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Build and rerun the project by hitting the Play button (or using ⌘ + <em>R</em>). When you get to a restaurant detail page, tap the time button and wait five seconds.
               You should now see a thumbnail image in the notification:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="485" src="assets/b59e052f-17c8-4dc7-ba37-34a84f05459a.png" width="264"/></div>
            
            <p>Also, if you click and pull down on the notification, you should see the following:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="518" src="assets/89d06ba3-0aee-4fb3-a80d-98e006b43972.png" width="282"/></div>
            
            <p>Thus far, we have been receiving notifications while inside of the app. If you want
               to test notifications outside of the app, take the following steps. Build and run
               the project by hitting the Play button (or using ⌘ + <em>R</em>). When you get to a restaurant detail page, tap the time button and, then, immediately
               hit ⌘ + <em>Shift</em> + <em>H</em>. This takes you out of the app, and you will then see the following:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="516" src="assets/e9303097-b8d7-4886-8b50-d2ec886f1dff.png" width="281"/></div>
            
            <p>If you click and pull down on the notification, you will see the following :</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="509" src="assets/ce81687b-bc13-4167-ae4f-75c665238710.png" width="277"/></div>
            
            <p>Our notifications are looking good, but you really cannot do anything with them. It
               would be nice to confirm your reservation with a yes or no, for example. We need to
               add some buttons for the notifications to do this.
            </p>

            <h1 class="header-title">Adding buttons</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>We only need to add a few things to add buttons to our notifications. First, we need
               to update our restaurant detail:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>Inside of the <kbd>RestaurantDetailViewController.swift</kbd> file, add the following into the <kbd>showNotification()</kbd> method after <kbd>content.sound = UNNotificationSound.default()</kbd>:
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            <pre style="padding-left: 60px">content.categoryIdentifier = "reservationCategory"</pre>
            <ol start="2">
               
               <li>Next, we need to create a file for our button identifiers. Right click the <kbd>Misc</kbd> folder inside of the <kbd>Common</kbd> folder and select <span class="packt_screen">New File</span>.
               </li>
               
               <li>Inside of the <span class="packt_screen">Choose a template for your new file screen</span>, select <span class="packt_screen">iOS</span> at the top and, then, <span class="packt_screen">Swift File</span>. Then, hit <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>.
               </li>
               
               <li>Name this file <kbd>Identifier</kbd> and hit <span class="packt_screen">Create</span>.
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <p>It is good practice to eliminate as many strings from your app as you can. Adding
               this file will not only eliminate strings, but it also keeps you from accidentally
               typing the wrong value. For example, we could easily misspell identifier. Therefore,
               it is a protective measure to have it in an <kbd>enum</kbd>. Add the following to the <kbd>import</kbd> statement in this new file:
            </p>
            <pre>enum Identifier:String {<br/>   case reservationCategory<br/>   case reservationIdentifier = "letsEatReservation"<br/>}<br/>enum Option:String {<br/>   case one = "optionOne"<br/>   case two = "optionTwo"<br/>}</pre>
            <p>We will use this to create our button options for our notification. Open the <kbd>AppDelegate.swift</kbd> file. In the <kbd>checkNotifications()</kbd> method, add the following code:
            </p>
            <pre>let optionOne = UNNotificationAction(identifier: Option.one.rawValue, title: "Yes", options: [.foreground])<br/>let optionTwo = UNNotificationAction(identifier: Option.two.rawValue, title: "No", options: [.foreground])<br/>let category = UNNotificationCategory(identifier: Identifier.reservationCategory.rawValue, actions: [optionOne, optionTwo], intentIdentifiers: [], options: [])<br/>UNUserNotificationCenter.current().setNotificationCategories([category])</pre>
            <p>Add this code inside of the <kbd>requestAuthorization</kbd> block:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/810fd1f9-8b8c-4786-a7a9-fc0fdb1d60e7.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In this code, we are setting up two actions: one for yes and one for no. We are creating
               a category and setting it to our notification category, which defines the type of
               notification that we want to use.
            </p>
            
            <p>Lastly, we need to write code to handle when we receive a notification. Return to
               the <kbd>RestaurantDetailViewController.swift</kbd> file and add the following inside of your new extension for notifications after the
               <kbd>willPresent()</kbd> method:
            </p>
            <pre>func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -&amp;gt; Void) {<br/>   if let identifier = Option(rawValue: response.actionIdentifier) {<br/>          switch identifier {<br/>          case .one :<br/>                 print("User selected yes")<br/>          case .two:<br/>                 print("User selected no")<br/>          }<br/>   }<br/>   completionHandler()<br/>}</pre>
            <p>Build and run the project by hitting the Play button (or using ⌘ + <em>R</em>). When you get the notification and pull down on it, you will see that you now have
               button options:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="415" src="assets/bed0c0e3-663d-459a-8a2c-267bfc60fa87.png" width="226"/></div>
            
            <p>Inside of our <kbd>didReceive()</kbd> method, we are printing out what the user selected, but you can choose whatever <kbd>print</kbd> statement you would like.
            </p>
            
            <p>Up until this point, we have looked at how to create basic notifications as well as
               notifications with images embedded in them. Next, we can take our app a step further
               by adding our custom UI into our notifications.
            </p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>To add custom UI to our notifications, we need to add an extension. Let's get started
               by doing the following:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>In the Navigator panel, select the Project navigator and, then, your project.</li>
               
               <li>At the bottom of the <span class="packt_screen">TARGETS</span> area, click the <span class="packt_screen">+</span> button.
               </li>
               
               <li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Notification Content Extension</span> under <span class="packt_screen">Application Extension</span> and, then, click <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>:
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="351" src="assets/2721b305-0bed-40d0-8b55-4f2f61a8ccb4.png" width="495"/></div>
            
            <ol start="4">
               
               <li>In the options screen that appears, set <span class="packt_screen">Product Name</span> to <kbd>LetsEatContentExtension</kbd> and click <span class="packt_screen">Finish</span>:
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="411" src="assets/f5ef2100-5432-4003-8509-6936932c589e.png" width="579"/></div>
            
            <ol start="5">
               
               <li>Next, select <span class="packt_screen">Activate</span> on the screen that appears:
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="156" src="assets/5af05f58-cf5f-4d5b-b950-6a7d4f7300d1.png" width="334"/></div>
            
            <p>This activation allows us to build and run our custom UI extension in the simulator.
               Now, you have a choice of running our app, the <em>iMessages</em> app, our kit or our custom UI extension.
            </p>
            
            <p>Now that our extension is created, we need to be able to use it.</p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>Open the <kbd>info.plist</kbd> file in our <kbd>LetsEatContentExtension</kbd> folder.
               </li>
               
               <li>Tap the <kbd>NSExtension</kbd> disclosure arrow to open up that key.
               </li>
               
               <li>Then, tap the disclosure arrow to open <kbd>NSExtensionAttributes</kbd>, under which you can see <kbd>UNNotificationExtensionCategory</kbd>:
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="238" src="assets/24e0f077-1858-4978-a1cc-2883eb3e8617.png" width="464"/></div>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 60px">This category is the name of the category of our notification we set earlier.</p>
            
            <ol start="4">
               
               <li>Update <kbd>myNotificationCategory</kbd> to <kbd>reservationCategory</kbd>.
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <p>Save the file and switch your target back to the <em>Let's Eat</em> app. Build and run the project by hitting the Play button (or using ⌘ + <em>R</em>). This time, instead of seeing our custom image, we now have the following:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="436" src="assets/92f42f90-9248-45ae-ac73-1ed0ccf67b8b.png" width="237"/></div>
            
            <p>You might have noticed something slightly off when you pulled down on the notification.
               The notification starts out large and then shrinks down. Inside of your <kbd>Info.plist</kbd> file, there is a property, <kbd>UNNotificationExtensionInitialContentSizeRatio</kbd>, that is currently set to <kbd>1</kbd>. Changing it to <kbd>0.25</kbd> makes this less obvious.
            </p>
            
            <p>Currently, this custom notification is showing us the custom and default content together.
               We can fix this by returning to our <kbd>Info.plist</kbd> inside of the <kbd>LetsEatContentExtension</kbd>:
            </p>
            
            <p>Inside of <kbd>NSExtensionAttributes</kbd>, add a new item called <kbd>UNNotificationExtensionDefaultContentHidden</kbd> and set the type as <span class="packt_screen">Boolean</span> and the value to <span class="packt_screen">YES</span>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6066b63b-e8ca-4184-840f-99f355589838.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Save the file and build and run the project by hitting the Play button (or using ⌘
               + <em>R</em>). Once you pull down on the notification, you see that the default content is hidden:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="459" src="assets/1d245047-67c7-4f08-88e7-117f2cfc4162.png" width="250"/></div>
            
            <p>You can now update the <kbd>MainInterface.storyboard</kbd> inside of your <kbd>LetsEatContentExtension</kbd> folder. In this book, we are not going to do this as we have done plenty of storyboarding,
               and this gives you an opportunity to practice what you have learned in this book to
               create a custom interface for this.
            </p>

            <p>Notifications in iOS 10 are now even more powerful and really give you the flexibility
               to create rich custom content with very little work. In this chapter, we learned how
               to build basic notifications and then we stepped it up a bit more by adding embedded
               images into our notifications. Lastly, we briefly looked at how to add a custom notification
               using an extension.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the next chapter, we will address how we can integrate 3D Touch into our app. 3D
               Touch allows users to jump into our app using shortcuts.
