  zh: 前言
- en: Functional programming (FP) is getting a lot of attention as it eases many of
    the difficulties faced in object-oriented programming (OOP), such as testability,
    maintainability, scalability, and concurrency. Swift has a lot of functional programming
    features that can be easily used, but most Objective-C and Swift programmers are
    not familiar with these tools.

  zh: 函数式编程（FP）因其简化了面向对象编程（OOP）中许多困难而受到广泛关注，例如可测试性、可维护性、可扩展性和并发性。Swift拥有许多易于使用的函数式编程特性，但大多数Objective-C和Swift程序员对这些工具并不熟悉。
- en: This book aims to simplify the functional programming paradigms and make it
    easily usable for Swift programmers, showing you how to use popular functional
    programming techniques to solve many of your day-to-day development problems.
    Whether you are new to functional programming and Swift or experienced, this book
    will provide you with the skills you need to design and develop high quality,
    easily maintainable, scalable, and efficient applications for iOS, macOS, tvOS,
    and watchOS. Through this book, you'll learn to build bug-free, maintainable code
    using functional programming.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with Functional Programming
    in Swift"), *Getting Started with Functional Programming in Swift*, introduces
    functional programming paradigms, such as immutability, stateless programming,
    pure, first-class, and higher-order functions. This chapter will provide an introduction
    to the Swift programming language and functional programming paradigms in Swift.'

  zh: '[第1章](ch01.html "第1章. Swift中的函数式编程入门"), *Swift中的函数式编程入门*，介绍了函数式编程范式，如不可变性、无状态编程、纯函数、一等函数和高级函数。本章将介绍Swift编程语言及其在Swift中的函数式编程范式。'
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Functions and Closures"), *Functions and
    Closures*, begins with a definition of functions, continues with other related
    topics, such as function types and tuples, and finally concludes with more advanced
    topics such as first-class functions, higher-order functions, function composition,
    closures, currying, recursion, and memoization.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Types and Type casting"), *Types and Type
    casting*, takes a look at types in general and explores reference versus value
    types in detail. We will cover topics such as value and reference type constants,
    mixing value and reference types, and copying. Then we will discuss the characteristics
    of value types. We will also cover the key differences between value and reference
    types, and how we should decide which one to use. We will continue by exploring
    equality, identity, type checking, and casting topics.'

    and Pattern Matching*, explains the enumeration definition and usage. We will
    cover associated and raw values and introduce the concept of algebraic data types.
    We will explore some examples to cover the sum, product, and recursion types.
    Also, in this chapter, we will explore patterns such as wildcard, value-binding,
    identifier, tuple, enumeration case, optional, type casting, and expression, along
    with related pattern matching examples.'
