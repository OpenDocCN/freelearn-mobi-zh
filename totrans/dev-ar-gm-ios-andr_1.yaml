    Whether that is an immersive 3D experience or simple text and indicators, virtual
    reality is both an old concept and a rising new technology. In this chapter we
    will go over the concept of augmented reality in its many forms, to broaden our
    view of the scope of the concept and how it can be utilized. We will also go over
    the tools that will help us materialize this concept in the explosively growing
    mobile platforms, particularly iOS devices. The following image shows an augmented

    technology that enables the addition of virtual content to the real world. This
    is usually associated with the addition of 3D content to a live feed from camera,

  zh: 增强现实（**AR**）在其最广泛和最简单的定义中，是一种使虚拟内容能够添加到现实世界中的技术。这通常与将3D内容添加到摄像头实时画面中相关联，尽管这个术语本身具有更广泛的意义和用法。
- en: Perhaps the simplest form of augmented reality that people have been using for
    decades is the one available in photo cameras more than a decade ago. Many use
    it, but very few realized the nature of the concept applied. It's the part of
    the camera called "the viewfinder", which is the little window you look through
    to view the world through the camera. This little window is in fact an augmented
    reality in a very simple form. What it fundamentally does is look at the world
    around it through the lens and then add a layer printed on glass to highlight
    the center of the lens and the borders of the image to be captured. What it did
    here is what augmented reality in all its forms aspires to do, which is to layer
    relative information over the real world.

  zh: 可能是人们几十年来一直在使用的最简单的增强现实形态，就是十多年前在照相机中可用的那种。许多人都在使用它，但很少有人意识到所应用概念的本质。这是相机中称为“取景器”的部分，是你通过它观察通过相机看世界的那个小窗口。这个小小的窗口实际上是一种非常简单的增强现实。它本质上是通过镜头观察周围的世界，然后添加一层印在玻璃上的图层，以突出镜头的中心和要捕捉的图像的边缘。在这里所做的是所有形态的增强现实都力求做到的事情，即在现实世界之上叠加相对信息。
- en: In mobile platforms, augmented reality works on the same principles even if
    the method is slightly different. The camera captures a live feed of the world
    around it, and then the computer vision systems try to get a bearing in the visible
    3D space and display the augmented reality in a way that is seamless with the
    world. The process of calculating the relative position of the user to the reality
    around, to be able to correctly augment the content for the user, is called tracking.

    on a technique to calculate the relative 3D space to the reality around us. It
    can achieve that using many technologies. For example, the Gyroscope on an iPhone
    can be used to track the placement of the phone in the 3D space that can be used
    to track the world relative to the device if movement is applied. That is usually
    seen in a number of augmented reality games for the device. That is certainly
    a form of AR but in this book, we will be mainly concerned with one form of tracking
    that uses computer vision.

  zh: 增强现实可以采取多种形式。它总是以某种形式依赖于一种计算相对于我们周围现实世界的相对3D空间的技术。它可以使用许多技术来实现这一点。例如，iPhone上的陀螺仪可以用来跟踪手机在3D空间中的放置，如果应用了运动，可以用来跟踪相对于设备的世界。这通常在许多增强现实游戏中看到。这当然是一种AR形式，但在这本书中，我们将主要关注一种使用计算机视觉的跟踪形式。
- en: Computer vision tracking can be divided into two sections, marker tracking and
    markerless tracking. In marker tracking, there is a physical entity that the computer
    vision is trained to track; it positions the camera's perspective relative to
    it. The physical object used is usually called a trackable. The trackable is usually
    handled internally to be the origin and the center of the world, which the computer
    vision can orient itself to. Sometimes, the camera live feed is the one considered
    to be the center of the world, and the trackable or trackables are objects that
    orbit it in space so to speak.

  zh: 计算机视觉跟踪可以分为两个部分：标记跟踪和无标记跟踪。在标记跟踪中，有一个物理实体，计算机视觉被训练去跟踪；它将摄像机的视角相对于它定位。所使用的物理对象通常被称为可跟踪对象。可跟踪对象通常被内部处理，作为原点和世界的中心，计算机视觉可以据此定位自己。有时，摄像头实时流被认为是世界的中心，可跟踪对象或可跟踪对象是围绕它旋转的物体，从某种意义上说。
- en: Markerless tracking techniques are essentially similar to marker tracking in
    that they try to find an origin point to augment the reality relative to. They
    differ in the way they find the origin point that, unlike marker tracking, they
    achieve without using a predefined physical object that the computer vision is
    only trained to follow. In Markerless tracking, the computer vision is mainly
    programmed to follow certain colors and shapes with a degree of freedom. For example,
    the computer can be trained to follow green objects of a certain shade and cover
    them completely with a blue one. In this case, it simply tracks the color; if
    it finds a green area in the camera feed, it augments it with a blue virtual object.
    Computer vision can even be trained to recognize faces, such as all the famous
    camera apps that add animated effects around the user's head or face. Markerless
    tracking is definitely more versatile, but it offers less reliability than marker
    tracking. Also Markerless tracking is naturally more complicated to develop, contributing
    to the popularity of the Marker tracking augmented reality.

  zh: 无标记跟踪技术本质上与标记跟踪相似，因为它们都试图找到一个基准点来相对于现实进行增强。它们在寻找基准点的方式上有所不同，与标记跟踪不同，它们不需要使用预先定义的物理对象，计算机视觉只训练跟随该对象。在无标记跟踪中，计算机视觉主要被编程为跟随某些颜色和形状，具有一定的自由度。例如，计算机可以被训练去跟随某种色调的绿色物体，并用蓝色物体将其完全覆盖。在这种情况下，它只是跟踪颜色；如果它在摄像头输入中找到一个绿色区域，它就会用蓝色虚拟物体进行增强。计算机视觉甚至可以被训练去识别面部，例如所有那些在用户头部或面部周围添加动画效果的名人相机应用程序。无标记跟踪无疑更加灵活，但它提供的可靠性比标记跟踪要低。此外，无标记跟踪自然地更复杂，这促进了标记跟踪增强现实技术的流行。

    the services it offers is cloud-based recognition. The Cloud Recognition service
    provided by Qualcomm enables apps to have over one million Image Targets at the
    same time. It allows an easier management of a large number of targets as well.
    This service is well suited for large deployment of targets that are subject to
    change, such as for retail stores to create an AR shopping experience. The service
    is free but limited to 1000 total images for non-business use and paid but unlimited
    for business.

  zh: Vuforia 还提供了一系列图像目标行为的解决方案。它提供的一项服务是基于云的识别。高通提供的云识别服务使得应用能够同时拥有超过一百万个图像目标。它还允许更轻松地管理大量目标。这项服务非常适合需要经常更改的大型目标部署，例如为零售店创建
    AR 购物体验。这项服务免费，但非商业用途限制在总共 1000 张图像，而商业用途则需要付费且无限制。

    The game engine has a built in IDE and the ability to deploy to numerous platforms.
    More than one million developers, making it the most popular game engine in the
    industry to date, are using Unity. It is designed for ease of use and high productivity.
    And because of its relatively easy learning curve and the fact that there is a
    free version of it being offered, encouraged some schools to teach Unity as an
    introduction to game development.

- en: Unity's greatest strength is its ability to deploy on a large number of platforms
    with ease and few changes to the project's structure. Unity's name comes from
    that particular strength. Unity can deploy on Windows, OS X, iOS, Android, Web
    plugin, Flash, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii U. That kind of reach opens up

- en: 'Unity allows you to choose from three languages to write scripts with. The
    languages available are JavaScript, C#, or Boo. Unity ships with a customized
    version of MonoDevelop for debugging purposes. In the same project, a combination
    of scripts using any of these languages is allowable, though it is recommended
    to only use one scripting language throughout the entire project to avoid any
    conflicts and to be easier to read and understand. In this book, we will use C#
    as the scripting language. The reason for the choice is that Vuforia uses C# for
    its scripts, and that makes it easier to communicate with Vuforia scripts as we
    will see later on. Also C# is a well-structured language that, while having a
    higher learning curve than JavaScript, is much more robust and less prone to mistakes.
    It is the language of choice for most professional studios as well. The following

    C# 作为脚本语言。选择的原因是 Vuforia 使用 C# 编写脚本，这使得我们稍后将更容易与 Vuforia 脚本进行通信。此外，C# 是一种结构良好的语言，虽然它的学习曲线比

    without having to use Unity, Unity offers a lot of tools that would simply take
    too long to create using OpenGL. Unity is a game engine that offers a lot of tools
    that can make 3D content look incredibly good and realistic. Some of the best-looking
    iPhone and iPad games on the iTunes market are created using Unity engine. Some

- en: Also Unity simplifies game logic greatly with the robust structure it offers.
    It offers a window into how the 3D graphics will look exactly and even how interactions
    will look. Unity using Vuforia can utilize a webcam to detect trackables and even
    show you how exactly the AR content will be on the trackable without having to
    deploy on the device first. That saves a lot of time that could have been wasted
    simply deploying on devices to find out that the 3D content doesn't look or behave
    correctly on the trackable.
