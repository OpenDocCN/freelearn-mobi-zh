    will go over the concept of augmented reality in its many forms, to broaden our
    view of the scope of the concept and how it can be utilized. We will also go over
    the tools that will help us materialize this concept in the explosively growing

    technology that enables the addition of virtual content to the real world. This
    is usually associated with the addition of 3D content to a live feed from camera,
    though the term in itself has a much broader meaning and usage.'

- en: Perhaps the simplest form of augmented reality that people have been using for
    decades is the one available in photo cameras more than a decade ago. Many use
    it, but very few realized the nature of the concept applied. It's the part of
    the camera called "the viewfinder", which is the little window you look through
    to view the world through the camera. This little window is in fact an augmented
    reality in a very simple form. What it fundamentally does is look at the world
    around it through the lens and then add a layer printed on glass to highlight
    the center of the lens and the borders of the image to be captured. What it did
    here is what augmented reality in all its forms aspires to do, which is to layer
    relative information over the real world.

- en: In mobile platforms, augmented reality works on the same principles even if
    the method is slightly different. The camera captures a live feed of the world
    around it, and then the computer vision systems try to get a bearing in the visible
    3D space and display the augmented reality in a way that is seamless with the
    world. The process of calculating the relative position of the user to the reality
    around, to be able to correctly augment the content for the user, is called tracking.

- en: Augmented reality can take many forms. It always depends in one form or another
    on a technique to calculate the relative 3D space to the reality around us. It
    can achieve that using many technologies. For example, the Gyroscope on an iPhone
    can be used to track the placement of the phone in the 3D space that can be used
    to track the world relative to the device if movement is applied. That is usually
    seen in a number of augmented reality games for the device. That is certainly
    a form of AR but in this book, we will be mainly concerned with one form of tracking
    that uses computer vision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Computer vision tracking can be divided into two sections, marker tracking and
    markerless tracking. In marker tracking, there is a physical entity that the computer
    vision is trained to track; it positions the camera's perspective relative to
    it. The physical object used is usually called a trackable. The trackable is usually
    handled internally to be the origin and the center of the world, which the computer
    vision can orient itself to. Sometimes, the camera live feed is the one considered
    to be the center of the world, and the trackable or trackables are objects that
    orbit it in space so to speak.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Markerless tracking techniques are essentially similar to marker tracking in
    that they try to find an origin point to augment the reality relative to. They
    differ in the way they find the origin point that, unlike marker tracking, they
    achieve without using a predefined physical object that the computer vision is
    only trained to follow. In Markerless tracking, the computer vision is mainly
    programmed to follow certain colors and shapes with a degree of freedom. For example,
    the computer can be trained to follow green objects of a certain shade and cover
    them completely with a blue one. In this case, it simply tracks the color; if
    it finds a green area in the camera feed, it augments it with a blue virtual object.
    Computer vision can even be trained to recognize faces, such as all the famous
    camera apps that add animated effects around the user's head or face. Markerless
    tracking is definitely more versatile, but it offers less reliability than marker
    tracking. Also Markerless tracking is naturally more complicated to develop, contributing
    to the popularity of the Marker tracking augmented reality.

    even woven into the pop-culture in sci-fi movies as old as we can remember. Augmented
    reality as a technology did not reach the mainstream till quite recently. In the
    past, augmented reality was considered a niche, because of the expensive setup
    it needed to function. Augmented reality is demanding when it comes to hardware.
    It needs a camera to view the world with, computational power to calculate and
    render the augmented content, and a way for the user to interact with the virtual
    content. All of this was difficult to attain for mainstream users.

    its potential. Perhaps in the lead is Qualcomm, the biggest mobile chip manufacturer
    in the world. Qualcomm realized the huge potential of AR present in mobile phones,
    and developed the free SDK Vuforia. Vuforia, known as QCAR in the past, was created
    to enable developers to tap that potential in the mobile space. Vuforia started
    out on Android platforms, and later expanded to include iOS devices as well. Qualcomm
    always includes subtle optimizations to AR on their chips to further improve the
    experience. This shows how much they believe in the future of the technology.
    Qualcomm even invested in making a more mobile-friendly OpenCV SDK called Easy
    CV. Easy CV is a tool for image processing and computer vision that can further
    enhance the experience of AR along other uses that involve computer vision.

    in the form of a head mounted display equipped with a camera. The design is to
    be unobtrusive, but at the same time efficient at displaying augmented reality
    data based on the input of the real world. Interaction will be in the form of

    for all human interactions. This fact is particularly interesting for virtual
    interaction because what the human mind is trying to make sense of is not physically
    there. The more elaborate the lie, the easier the mind will believe it. So the
    art of immersion is the art of telling the perfect lie to the mind. And as all
    good liars will say, if they were honest for that moment, the way to tell the
    perfect lie is to mix it with the truth. By that definition, augmented reality

    to the content presented in a way most other virtual medias fall short of. Watching
    a user interact with augmented reality content for the first time is always wonderful.
    Often, we can see that the user forgets for a moment that they are watching the
    virtual content through the screen of their device and try to grab it with their
    hands as if to check it's not really there. It happens almost consistently and
    certainly subconsciously. This is indicative of how much the user is immersed
    in the action.

    augmented reality content. The user can view the content from almost all angles.
    They can walk around it, come close to it, and walk away from it. The fact that
    it stays consistent with the world around them, maintains the connection between
    the user and the content. If the experience is mixed with the right audio and/or
    video content, it can be something that brings a smile on the user's face.

    a great boost. It has one of the fastest tracking algorithms in the market that
    is less prone to trackable occlusion and even low light conditions. This makes
    the apps created using the SDK user-friendly and easy to use. Best of all, the
    Vuforia SDK is offered for free, making it widely used with an active community
    on the forums tackling most issues that might arise.

    when interacting together. For example, the SDK offers the ARCamera component.
    The ARCamera component will automatically take the video camera feed from the
    device and display it for the use. It will also detect trackables that the developer
    specified for the camera. The ARCamera will respond to the orientation of the
    user in relation to the trackable mostly without much intervention from the developer.

    to detect and show the AR content layered on top of it. By simply adding the content
    to this component and setting what image it needs to track, the AR content will
    appear relative to the trackable image in the real world. The following image

    from the physical object. It means that if an object is to rotate around the box
    being tracked, it can be developed so that the 3D is occluded when it passes behind
    the object being tracked.'

    technology that is Image Target. Using Image Targets, a natural experience can
    be delivered to the user because of how relevant the trackable image can be. For
    example, the trackable image can be an advertisement with information on it but
    also, if looked at through the AR app, it displays a video playback layered on
    the image as if the image came to life.
  prefs: []

    datasets, the data of the image such as the edges and contrasting areas are stored,
    and the ARCamera keeps on processing the live feed video looking for areas that
    match any of the images inside the dataset. When that happens, the trackable is
    considered found in the real world and AR content is layered on. The app can have
    more than one dataset active simultaneously. Each dataset can have up to 100 images.
    That is a lot of data the app can process in real-time, which shows how powerful
    Vuforia can be.
