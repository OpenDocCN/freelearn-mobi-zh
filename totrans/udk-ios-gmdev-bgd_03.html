Inside space stations, epic fantasy towns, a forest, even someone's own back yard. Something that all of these places have in common is that we use the same basic tools in order to make every kind of environment that we can imagine! You'll see how we can easily expand on what we've done here and afterwards in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Bringing it All Together">Chapter 6</a>,<em> Bringing It All Together</em>, we will explore how Geometry mode can make blocking out an area really easy, but for now, let's create a door.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec02"/>Time for action—creating an exterior</h1></div></div></div><p>At the moment, we have a single room that is textured and has some objects in it. This is great, but we can take some steps to expand this world to create something even better! First though, let's regroup and make sure we are all on the same page.<a class="indexterm" id="id198"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">From the top menu, select<strong> View</strong> |<strong> Viewport Configuration</strong> |<strong> 2x1 Split</strong>.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"/>Note</h3><p>There are many different options that you can use in determining how UDK is displayed and works for you, and I encourage you to take the time to figure out what you like and don't like. While having a<strong> Front</strong> viewport is fine, I like having a larger screen space for the<strong> Perspective</strong> view so I have a better idea of what the area I'm creating looks like. This is more my personal preference than anything, but it is what I will be using from now on.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">From the<strong> Top</strong> viewport, hold<em> Ctrl</em> +<em> Alt</em> and drag from slightly higher on the top left-hand side to past the bottom right-hand side of the room that we've created.<a class="indexterm" id="id199"/><p>While holding <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Alt</em> and dragging the mouse you will notice a red rectangle being created. When you let go of the right mouse button all of the objects inside of the area will be selected. This is useful for selecting many objects at once inside an area.
</p><p>If you cannot see the whole room inside the viewport, move back using the scroll wheel on the mouse. To move inside a viewport, you will first need to click inside it. To drag the screen, hold the right mouse button and drag in the direction you want to move it.
</p></li><li class="listitem">Zoom into the top left-hand side of the room and right-click on the top vertices on the left-hand side. You should notice the room snapping to the grid. If you do not see anything happen, you are either perfectly aligned or you have the grid lock off. To enable it again, there is a checkbox on the right-hand side of a number with half of a grid on the left-hand side. Make sure that that checkbox is checked. Right-click inside of the<strong> Side</strong> viewport and right-click on the top vertices on the left-hand side.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>At this point our room now fits to the grid. We want to build to the grid so that it will be easier for us to make sure that everything is seamless and we don't have holes inside of our geometry, which is a common problem that I see when people are starting out in UDK. Also note that right-clicking on a vertex moves the widget to that vertex. If you wanted to rotate an object by a certain vertex, this would be how you could do that.</p></div><div><img alt="Time for action—creating an exterior" src="img/image_1901_03_01.jpg" width="396"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Save your level and click on<strong> Build All</strong>. When finished, you will notice that the level looks the same, though it may have shifted a bit.</li><li class="listitem">Next confirm that the grid spacing size is<strong> 16</strong>. If the number is lower than<strong> 16</strong>, press the<em> ]</em> key until it is<strong> 16</strong>. If it is higher than<strong> 16</strong>, press the<em> [</em> key. You should see the grid on the level change based on what keys were pressed.</li><li class="listitem">Left-click on the brush on the left-hand side in the<strong> Top</strong> viewport. Right-click to enter the<strong> Perspective</strong> viewport and adjust your view so that you can see the middle of the wall.<a class="indexterm" id="id200"/><p>Remember, you may hold the left-hand side button to look left and right, right to pan, and both to move forward or backward. To zoom in and out in the viewport, simply use the scroll wheel. Another option for moving is holding the right mouse button and using the <em>W</em>, <em>A</em>, <em>S</em>, and <em>D</em> keys to move around like you would in a first person shooter.
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the<strong> Side</strong> viewport, click on the button that looks like a 3D cube to go into<strong> Geometry Mode</strong>. Right-click on the top vertices on the left-hand side of the brush and make sure you are in translation mode by either clicking on the menu icon that looks like four arrows crossing or pressing the<em> Space bar</em> until you see the arrows for translation.</li><li class="listitem">Hold the<em> Alt</em> key and drag the brush down using the red arrow in the<strong> Top</strong> viewport moving it down until you reach slightly less than half way through the brush.<a class="indexterm" id="id201"/><p>You should notice the object moving, but when you let go, you will see two brushes in its place. We have effectively made a copy of the previous wall for us to use to create a door.
</p><div><img alt="Time for action—creating an exterior" height="251" src="img/image_1901_03_02.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Drag the<strong> Top</strong> viewport down to the bottom of our newly created brush by holding, right-clicking, and dragging up. Holding<em> Ctrl</em> +<em> Alt</em>, select both vertices at the bottom of the wall. You should see the two blue squares change to red. Drag those vertices up until they are close to the other end of the brush, with enough space existing to create a door.<a class="indexterm" id="id202"/></li><li class="listitem">Using<em> Ctrl</em> +<em> Alt</em> in<strong> Geometry Mode</strong> will only select the vertices of the selected objects, which can be useful for only altering small parts of a larger object without worrying about things.<a class="indexterm" id="id203"/><div><img alt="Time for action—creating an exterior" height="134" src="img/image_1901_03_03.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">In the<strong> Side</strong> viewport hold<em> Ctrl</em> +<em> Alt</em> and select the bottom of our door and drag the object to be at the same level as the floor we created earlier. Next, select the last two vertices and drag it down so that it is higher than a person would go through, but with space for an overhead area for the door. I made mine 12 squares tall (at 16 units a box).<a class="indexterm" id="id204"/></li><li class="listitem">Switch back to<strong> Camera Mode</strong> (click on the<strong> Camera</strong> icon next to the<strong> Geometry Mode</strong> icon) and press<em> F4</em> to access the properties of the door brush.

This is because now that the room is open, it is trying to draw the point lights influence inside the entire world. However, we only care about the room and the area immediately outside of the room which won't take nearly for a while.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec03"/>Previewing the mobile editor</h1></div></div></div><p>There is a button in the top bar that looks like a small phone with a brown screen that, when highlighted, says<strong> Emulate Mobile Features</strong>. When clicked, this will change your display to look closer to what it will look like on the iOS device, and is a better tool to use while doing lighting. In my experience, Unreal tends to make things either too dark or too light, so it can be a challenge to find something that works well on both an iOS device and PC. If you are trying to create a game for both systems, you may want to have two separate forms of lighting and test it on the actual device until you are happy with it.<a class="indexterm" id="id226"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec02"/>Particles make everything better</h2></div></div></div><p>The world we live in is very complex and certain things, such as explosions and fires, are very hard to replicate inside a game engine, due to a number of factors, but mostly due to the limitations of what is possible to do at 60/30 frames per second (fps). The best way to do this at a small cost is to use something called a<strong> particle system</strong>. Some of the many things you can do include creating smoke, electric sparks, falling leaves, snow, dust, and fantasy elements like magic spells. Particles are usually subtle in games, but it is often the little things that make the biggest impact on us in creating the suspension of disbelief that we are going for in our games.<a class="indexterm" id="id227"/>
</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"/>Note</h3><p>It is worth noting that while particles are a relatively easy way to add special effects on a mobile device, they can also be one of the more expensive things to add to your level. This can be due to a number of factors; alpha blending caused by sprite-based particle systems heavily taxes the GPU's fill rate, while particle systems with high particle counts heavily tax the CPU due to an increased count of objects to update every frame. There's a fine balance to be found on mobile in this regard, and the right balance will heavily depend on what else is going on in the game. Playtesting your game on your intended device is the best way to see just how much your game can handle things.

</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"/>Note</h3><p>Like most things that you will run into on mobile devices, this is quite a balancing act. Fog on mobile devices should really only be considered in extreme cases where large view distances would cause significant visual pop in, or where the fog distance is low enough that a significant amount of the level will be culled.
