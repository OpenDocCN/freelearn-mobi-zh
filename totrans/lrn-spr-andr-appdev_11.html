<li>Spring is built on Java <strong>Standard Edition</strong> (<strong>SE</strong>), but can run Java <strong>Enterprise Edition</strong> (<strong>EE</strong>)</li>
<li>Almost all Java-supported IDEs where you can use Spring, such as NetBeans, and Visual Studio</li>
<li>Tomcat is a web server</li>
<li>You can also use Jetty and Undertow for Spring development</li>
<li>No. You can you use IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio—Xamarin, PhoneGap, Corona, and CppDroid, but Android Studio is highly recommended, and it is the official IDE for developing an Android app</li>

<li>Spring stands out as the most broadly utilized Java EE framework. Spring Framework's core ideas are <em>Dependency Injection</em> and <em>Aspect-Oriented Programming</em>. Spring Framework can also be utilized in normal Java applications to accomplish free coupling between various segments by actualizing dependency injection, and we can perform cross-cutting assignments.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li class="mce-root">Dependency injection configuration design enables us to expel the hardcoded dependencies and make our application approximately coupled, extendable, and viable. We can execute a dependency injection example to move the dependency goals from accumulate time to runtime. A portion of the advantages of utilizing Dependency Injection is Detachment of Concerns, Boilerplate Code decrease, Configurable segments, and simple unit testing.</li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Aspect-oriented programming</strong> (<strong>AOP</strong>) is a programming worldview that supplements <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> (<strong>OOP</strong>) by isolating the worries of a software application to enhance modularization.</li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Inversion of Control</strong> (<strong>IoC</strong>) is the instrument to accomplish free coupling among object dependencies. To accomplish free coupling and dynamic official of the objects at runtime, objects characterize their dependencies that are being injected by other constructing agent objects. Spring IoC container is the program that injects dependencies into an object and prepares it for our utilization.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Any normal Java class that is introduced by Spring IoC container is called Spring Bean. We utilize a Spring <kbd>ApplicationContext</kbd> to get the Spring Bean occurrence.</li>
<li class="mce-root">Much the same as MVC configuration design, a controller is the class that deals with all the customer requests and sends them to the arranged assets to deal with. In Spring MVC, <kbd>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</kbd> is the front controller class that introduces the context-dependent on the Spring beans configurations.</li>
<li><kbd>DispatcherServlet</kbd> is the front controller in a Spring MVC application, and it stacks the Spring Bean configuration file, stating every one of the beans that are arranged. In the event that annotations are empowered, it additionally filters the bundles and designs any beans annotated with the <kbd>@Component</kbd>, <kbd>@Controller</kbd>, <kbd>@Repository</kbd>, or <kbd>@Service</kbd> annotations.</li>
<li><kbd>ContextLoaderListener</kbd> is the audience to fire up and close down Spring's root <kbd>WebApplicationContext</kbd>. Its important roles are to tie the life cycle of <kbd>ApplicationContext</kbd> to the life cycle of the <kbd>ServletContext</kbd>, and to robotize the production of <kbd>ApplicationContext</kbd>. We can utilize it to characterize shared beans that can be utilized across various Spring contexts.</li>
<li>Boilerplate code is repetitive code that shows up again and again for similar purposes.</li>

<li>REST means REpresentational State Transfer; it is a generally new aspect of composing a web programming interface.
<p class="mce-root">RESTFUL is referred for web services composed by applying REST building idea are called RESTful services. It centers around system assets and how the condition of an asset ought to be transported over HTTP convention to various clients written in various dialects. In a RESTful web service, HTTP methods such as <kbd>GET</kbd>, <kbd>POST</kbd>, <kbd>PUT</kbd>, and <kbd>DELETE</kbd> can be utilized to perform CRUD activities.</p>
</li>
<li>The architectural style for creating a web API is as follows:
<ul>
<li>HTTP for client-server communication</li>
<li>XML/JSON as a formatting language</li>
<li>Simple URI as the address for the services</li>
<li>Stateless communication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <kbd>SOAPUI</kbd> tool for <kbd>SOAP WS</kbd> and Firefox <em>poster</em> plugin for <kbd>RESTFUL</kbd> services.</li>
<li>Web services dependent on REST architecture are known as RESTful web services. These web services utilize HTTP methods to execute the idea of REST architecture. A RESTful web service more often than not characterizes a URI (Uniform Asset Identifier), a service, gives asset portrayal, for example, JSON and set of HTTP methods.</li>
<li>URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. Every asset in REST architecture is recognized by its URI. The motivation behind a URI is to find a resource on the server facilitating the web service.</li>
<li>It is an HTTP success code: <kbd>OK</kbd>.</li>
<li>It is an HTTP client error code: <kbd>Not Found</kbd>.</li>

<li>H2 is an open source Java database that is very lightweight. It can be embedded in Java applications. It also runs on the client-server model.</li>
<li>A <em>resource</em> means how data will be represented in <em>REST</em> architecture. It allows a client to read, write, modify, and create resources using HTTP methods, for example <kbd>GET</kbd>, <kbd>POST</kbd>, <kbd>PUT</kbd>, <kbd>DELETE</kbd>, and so on.</li>
<li>CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.</li>
<li>DAO is an abstraction of data persistence. <em>Repository</em> is an abstraction of a collection of objects.</li>
