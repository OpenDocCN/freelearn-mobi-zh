    in software development. If we are to start completely from scratch, it will take
    a very long time to see any results.

    number of predefined classes and methods that will help in our game development
    process.

    the course of the book, we will learn each stage of game development. With each
    chapter, our game will mature from being just an idea to a complete entity, while
    extending our knowledge of Sparrow.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to develop applications for iOS, you need to have a Mac and, preferably,
    the latest version of Mac OS X. Although an Apple developer account and iOS Developer
    Program are not necessary, it is recommended as it allows you to run the examples
    on actual devices such as the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad and distribute your
    applications to the Apple App Store. Keep in mind that the iOS Developer Program
    comes with additional costs.
