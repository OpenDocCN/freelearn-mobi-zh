If we are to start completely from scratch, it will take a very long time to see any results.</p><p>With the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and subsequent devices in the following years, developing applications for mobile devices took off, and more than 1,000,000 apps can now be downloaded from the App Store.</p><p>Luckily, Sparrow, an open source game framework for iOS, provides us with a number of predefined classes and methods that will help in our game development process.</p><p>Instead of showing how to develop a part of a game example-by-example during the course of the book, we will learn each stage of game development. With each chapter, our game will mature from being just an idea to a complete entity, while extending our knowledge of Sparrow.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Beautifying Our Game">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Beautifying Our Game</em></span>, covers moving and animating our entities on the screen.

<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Integrating Third-party Services">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Integrating Third-party Services</em></span>, takes a look at how we could integrate third-party services such as Apple Game Center in the hope of improving our players' experience.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to develop applications for iOS, you need to have a Mac and, preferably, the latest version of Mac OS X. Although an Apple developer account and iOS Developer Program are not necessary, it is recommended as it allows you to run the examples on actual devices such as the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad and distribute your applications to the Apple App Store. Keep in mind that the iOS Developer Program comes with additional costs.</p><p>There is no need to have Sparrow and Xcode installed on your system; we will cover the installation process in the first chapter.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended for those who are interested in game development, those who have already dabbled in game development but haven't made any games for mobiles yet, and those who wish to publish a game on the Apple App Store in the future.</p><p>You need a solid understanding of Objective-C to follow the examples in the book, and some experience in game development is definitely helpful, although is not necessarily required.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find several headings appearing frequently.</p><p>To give clear instructions of how to complete a procedure or task, we use:</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Time for action &#x2013; heading"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec06"/>Time for action – heading</h1></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Action 1</li><li class="listitem">Action 2</li><li class="listitem">Action 3</li></ol></div><p>Instructions often need some extra explanation so that they make sense, so they are followed with:</p><div class="section" title="What just happened?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec03"/>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h2></div></div></div><p>This heading explains the working of tasks or instructions that you have just completed.</p><p>You will also find some other learning aids in the book, including:</p></div><div class="section" title="Pop quiz – heading"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec04"/>Pop quiz – heading</h2></div></div></div><p>These are short, multiple-choice questions intended to help you test your own understanding.</p></div><div class="section" title="Have a go hero – heading"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec05"/>Have a go hero – heading</h2></div></div></div><p>These practical challenges give you ideas for experimenting with what you have learned.</p><p>You will also find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "This class needs to be inherited from the <code class="literal">SPSprite</code> class."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows: </p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">// Setting the background
SPSprite *background = [[SPSprite alloc] init];

// Loading the logo image and bind it on the background sprite
SPSprite *logo = [SPImage imageWithContentsOfFile:@"logo.png"];
[background addChild:logo];</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">// Setting the background
