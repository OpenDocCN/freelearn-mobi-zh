    to life and watch it grow over time. Successful growth over time needs sustainability,
    a key factor for enduring ideas. The most common way of communicating a sustainable
    proposition for a new idea is the business plan.

    levers for growth over time.

    writing the plan, and the second is keeping it up to date as your business evolves.

    forgotten afterwards. Investor attention would tend to gravitate around targets
    and the company's performance in the direction of these targets, without paying
    attention to core aspects of the business. However, a business plan performs many
    functions throughout the life of your business. It should be treated as a living
    document, and it should be maintained and updated as your business evolves.

- en: Agile development has matured over the last decade, and Scrum and XP are common
    today in many organizations. Agile radically changed organizations that were used
    to building software in large monolith waterfall releases by moving them to an
    iterative model. This enables teams to work more closely with customers to build
    software.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where waterfall models usually expect that the problem definition was fixed,
    Agile practitioners went in with the assumption that the problem definition may
    be somewhat fluid. Note that in both cases, the solution is unknown. The engineering
    team works a close loop to iterate through solution definition, with the understanding
    that the problem definition may evolve along the way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While waterfall and Agile both assume some level of definition of the problem,
    customer development is all about problem discovery. We start with exploring an
    unknown problem through customer discovery, an open-ended exercise to find unmet
    needs. This then leads to a rapid cycle of working early and often with customers
    to validate their needs and then to scale the model.

    is an important concept that is a departure from the traditional big bang approach
    of building out a polished product and then taking it to the market. It represents
    the minimal set of features and functionality that would need to be built in a
    product in order to test market viability and maximize validate learning.

    tests can be simple landing pages, interactive wireframes, or functional prototypes.
    The key is to create an MVP that tests the validity of the hypotheses you created

    way to dip your toe in the water. It can test whether your target audience is
    interested in the solution and value proposition you developed in your BMC. You
    can also measure word-of-mouth referrals on a prototype, for example, to see how
    scalable your solution is.

    you think*. But this can be a challenge for many development teams who care about
    putting out polished work. If they feel that the product is incomplete, they will
    hesitate to put it out for review and testing.

    improve. Invariably, putting a minimal version of your product out in the market
    may lead to critical feedback about areas which you may have chosen not to pay
    attention to. This is where a balanced, pragmatic approach is important. You may
    choose to disregard feedback in these areas, since it was a deliberate choice
    that you made.
