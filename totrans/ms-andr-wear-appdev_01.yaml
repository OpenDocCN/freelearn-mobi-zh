    used as a calculator during the *Qing dynasty* ([http://www.chinaculture.org/classics/2010-04/20/content_383263_4.htm](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2584437/Is-wearable-computer-300-year-old-Chinese-abacus-ring-used-Qing-Dynasty-help-traders.html)):'

    a computer happens anywhere and everywhere and through any device around them.
    Let's say, for example, that you are working on an important business proposal
    using your office desktop computer and you are almost done with your proposal
    document, but it's time to leave the office and pick up your kid from school and
    take her to swimming practice. You left work, picked up your kid, and took her
    to the swimming school. While she is doing her swimming practice, you continue
    to work on the business proposal from where you left off using your smartphone
    and send the document to the client just before she is done with the swimming
    practice.

- en: While you are driving home, you get a response e-mail from the client. The computer
    integrated into the car you are driving is equipped with an app or system like
    *Siri* or *Alexa* that reads the e-mail message you received from the client out
    loud. And when you reach home, you respond to the client's business proposal using
    your smartwatch and even set up a date and place for the next meeting.

- en: This example might sound a little exaggerated, but the important point to make
    here is that it's not the technology taking over human lives, it's the humans
    doing what they want to do whenever and wherever, seamlessly, and using simple
    interactions. The devices around them would help them do what they want to do
    without knowing or feeling that they do. That is the foundation philosophy of
    ubiquitous computing. It just lets you do things wherever you need to without
    asking or needing to know if that can be done there.

    Communications** (**NFC**), **Radio Frequency Identifications** (**RFID**), and

- en: Application developers, designers, and service providers should design their
    apps and services so that the users may interact with them anywhere and using
    any devices around them. Every device has its own form factor and is built for
    certain needs. Understanding the user context and the need for interaction with
    the device is very important when building apps that will provide great user experience.
    For instance, it may not be practical to have a keyboard-like UI component in
    a watch app due to its size and form factor, whereas it may be feasible to use
    voice input using a text-to-speech feature provided within wearable platforms.
