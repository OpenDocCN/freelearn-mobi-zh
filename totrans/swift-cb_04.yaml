    the type we are interacting with directly. This is helpful because it means we
    know the capabilities that the type has; we can put those capabilities to use
    and ensure that the outputs have the correct type. However, we now have a construct

    types, even if the concepts are the same.

    principles and builds on them to create expressive and powerful language features.
    The concept of mathematical operators, such as *+*, *-*, ***, and */* for addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively, seems so fundamental
    as to not warrant a mention. However, in Swift, this common mathematical functionality
    is built on top of an underlying operator system that is extensible and powerful.

    in relation to the `Device` class. Nesting the type also allows us to simplify
    the names of these types. It would be customary to name them `DeviceCategory`
    and `DeviceOrientation` to avoid confusion, but since they are nested, we can
    remove the `Device` prefix.

    without any qualifiers; however, this is not the case for use outside of the containing
