			<p>Many people still carry cash, but cash can be lost or stolen, and carrying a lot of cash can be cumbersome. Thus, many people rely on credit and debit cards instead.</p>
			<p>Although credit and debit cards can be lost or stolen too, they're so much easier to carry than large amounts of cash. However, one huge problem with credit and debit cards is that their numbers can be stolen and used by thieves. </p>
			<p>To protect your credit and debit card numbers from thieves, Apple introduced Apple Pay. The main idea behind Apple Pay is that you use an existing credit or debit card, but instead of giving out that credit or debit card to merchants, you use Apple Pay instead, which hides your credit or debit card number. By protecting your credit or debit card number from merchants, Apple Pay reduces the threat of others stealing your crucial credit or debit card numbers by hacking into a merchant's network.</p>
			<p>Since Apple Pay is linked to your iPhone, it requires Touch ID (your fingerprint) or Face ID (your face) to authorize payment either in person or online. So, not only does Apple Pay protect your credit or debit card numbers, but it also prevents anyone from getting access to your credit or debit card numbers stored on your iPhone. Apple Pay offers a safe and secure way to make purchases.</p>

			<p class="callout"> Apple Pay may not be available in all areas of the world.</p>
			<p>The topics this chapter covers are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting up Apple Pay</li>
				<li>Defining a shipping address</li>
				<li>Paying with Apple Pay</li>
				<li>Getting an Apple Card</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor613"/><a id="_idTextAnchor614"/><a id="_idTextAnchor615"/><a id="_idTextAnchor616"/>Setting up Apple Pay</h1>
			<p>Before you can use <a id="_idIndexMarker1021"/>Apple Pay, you must already have a valid credit or debit card. Once you have a valid credit or debit card, or if you apply for an <strong class="bold">Apple Card</strong>, then you can <a id="_idIndexMarker1022"/>set up Apple Pay by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Wallet</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Wallet</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. A <strong class="bold">Card Type</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 18.1</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 18.1 – The Card Type screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure18.1_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 18.1 – The Card Type screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Credit or Debit Card</strong>. An <strong class="bold">Apple Pay</strong> screen appears. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Continue</strong>. An <strong class="bold">Add Card</strong> screen appears that lets you either manually enter credit card numbers or scan an image using the iPhone camera.</li>
				<li>Scan your credit or debit card with the iPhone camera and tap <strong class="bold">Next</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Card Details</strong> screen appears.  <p class="callout-heading">Important note: </p><p class="callout">Apple Pay's photo-detection method only works with embossed numbers. If your credit or debit card has flat numbers, you will have to enter the numbers manually.</p></li>
				<li>Type the expiration date and <a id="_idIndexMarker1023"/>security code for the credit or debit card and tap <strong class="bold">Next</strong>.</li>
				<li>Follow the remaining on-screen instructions. You will need to choose a verification method such as receiving an email, text, or phone call to receive a verification code that you will need to enter on the screen to complete the process.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Depending on your bank, you may need to go through another step to authorize your credit or debit card for Apple Pay. Once you go through this additional authentication process, you'll be ready to start using Apple Pay with your chosen credit or debit card.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor617"/>Adding multiple cards to your Apple Pay account</h2>
			<p>You can actually assign multiple credit or debit cards to your Apple Pay account. Then, you can choose which card to use when you use Apple Pay by defining a default card to use.</p>
			<p>To change the default card to use if you have assigned multiple cards to an Apple Pay account, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 18.2</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 18.2 – The Wallet &amp; Apple Pay screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure18.2_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 18.2 – The Wallet &amp; Apple Pay screen</p></li>
				<li>Scroll down and tap <strong class="bold">Default Card</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Default Card</strong> screen appears, listing all the credit<a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/> and debit cards stored in your Apple Pay account.</li>
				<li>Tap the card you want to use.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-298"><a id="_idTextAnchor618"/>Removing cards from your Apple Pay account</h2>
			<p>If you have added a credit or debit card to Apple Pay and later want to remove it, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</strong> screen appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 18.2</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the credit or debit <a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/>card you want to remove. More detailed information about that card appears.</li>
				<li>Scroll all the way down and tap <strong class="bold">Remove This Card</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've defined a credit or debit card to use with Apple Pay, you should also define a shipping address. This way, if you purchase items online using Apple Pay, your iPhone can send your shipping address to the merchant automatically so that you won't have to type in your address yourself.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor619"/>Defining a shipping address</h1>
			<p>A shipping address defines where <a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/>you want goods to be sent when you purchase them online. If you move or simply want to ship items to another address other than a home address, you should define a shipping address for Apple Pay to use. </p>
			<p>To define a shipping address for Apple Pay, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</strong> screen appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 18.2</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Shipping Address</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Shipping Address</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>If multiple addresses appear, tap on the address you want to use by default. If you want to add a new address, tap <strong class="bold">Enter New Shipping Address</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Any time you change addresses, make sure you update your shipping address to ensure that any packages you order get sent to your current location.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor620"/>Paying with Apple Pay</h1>
			<p>When you're in a store that<a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/> accepts Apple Pay, you can use your iPhone to pay for merchandise. Even if you have the credit card itself with you, it's safer to use Apple Pay because it won't let a merchant store your credit or debit card numbers, which an unauthorized person could steal off that merchant's network. </p>
			<p>You can use Apple Pay whenever you see one of the following two symbols, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 18.3</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 18.3 – The Wallet &amp; Apple Pay screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure18.3_B14100.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 18.3 – The Wallet &amp; Apple Pay screen</p>
			<p>To use Apple Pay with<a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/> Face ID, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Double-tap the side button and glance at your phone to authorize Apple Pay. </li>
				<li>Hold your iPhone near the contactless reader until a checkmark appears on your screen.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To use Apple Pay<a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/> with Touch ID, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Rest your finger on the Home button, which contains the fingerprint recognizer. </li>
				<li>Hold your iPhone near the contactless reader until a checkmark appears on your screen.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you use Apple Pay, you may want to review your recent transactions to help you track your spending habits.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor621"/>Viewing past transactions</h2>
			<p>When you make <a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/>purchases with Apple Pay, some banks (but not all) will store your recent transactions so that you can view them again in two different ways. To view Apple Pay transactions through the Wallet app, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Wallet</strong> app on the Home Screen. Your default Apple Pay credit or debit card appears. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Credit or Debit Card</strong>. A list of transactions appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 18.4</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 18.4 – Viewing Apple Pay transactions from the Wallet app&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure18.4_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 18.4 – Viewing Apple Pay transactions from the Walle<a id="_idTextAnchor622"/><a id="_idTextAnchor623"/>t app</p>
			<p>Another way to view recent Apple Pay transactions is through the Settings app, which you can view by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</strong> screen appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 18.2</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap a payment card.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Transactions</strong> tab. The list <a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/>of transactions appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 18.5</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 18.5 – Viewing Apple Pay transactions from the Settings app&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure18.5_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 18.5 – Viewing Apple Pay transactions from the Settings app</p>
			<p>Apple Pay is meant to provide a secure form of payment using an existing credit card. Since Apple Pay is meant to provide contactless payments, you might prefer to dedicate a credit card just for <a id="_idIndexMarker1032"/>Apple Pay. For many people, such a dedicated Apple Pay credit card could be Apple's own credit card, known as <strong class="bold">Apple Card</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor624"/>Getting an Apple Card</h1>
			<p>An Apple Card is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1033"/>credit card created by Apple but issued by <strong class="bold">Goldman Sachs</strong>. Although the Apple Card's primary <a id="_idIndexMarker1034"/>purpose is to link with Apple Pay, Apple will send you a physical Apple credit card to use in places that accept credit cards but do not accept Apple Pay.</p>
			<p>To apply for an Apple Card through your iPhone, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Wallet</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Wallet</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. A <strong class="bold">Card Type</strong> screen appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 18.1</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Apply for Apple Card</strong>. An Apple Card application screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 18.6</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 18.6 – Applying for an Apple Card&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure18.6_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 18.6 – Applying for an Apple Card</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Continue</strong> and follow the instructions. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Remember, just because <a id="_idIndexMarker1035"/>you apply for an Apple Card, does not mean you will automatically get one. To better understand the approval process for an Apple Card and the various features <a id="_idIndexMarker1036"/>available with the Apple Card, visit Apple's website (<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/financial-health">https://www.apple.com/apple-card/financial-health</a>). </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor626"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Every few years, the news releases a story about how hackers have broken into the computer network of a major corporation and stolen all the credit card numbers that the company stored from their customers. Since you can't protect your credit or debit card number once it's stored on another company's computers, you can do the next best thing and protect your credit or debit card from getting read and stored by merchants in the first place. </p>
			<p>By using Apple Pay whenever possible, you can protect your credit or debit card numbers because that information will never be given to any merchants, whether you shop online or in-person.</p>
			<p>Since Apple Pay is linked to your fingerprint (Touch ID) or face (Face ID), it's extremely difficult for anyone to use your Apple Pay account without your permission. So, Apple Pay protects your credit or debit card numbers from thieves, whether they try to steal your credit or debit card numbers from another company or try to steal your iPhone.</p>
			<p>Apple Pay can turn your iPhone into a secure, contactless payment system. With Apple Pay, the risk of hackers or thieves stealing your credit or debit card numbers drops dramatically.</p>
