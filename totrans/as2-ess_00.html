Mobile operating systems are available not only for smart phones, but tablets as well, therefore increasing the possible market share for these applications.</p><p>Android has characteristics that make it pleasant for developers such as open source and having a high level of community, driven development. Android has always been in competition with iOS (the Apple mobile system) in everything and with XCode, iOS presented itself as a more centralized development environment. The new Android Studio IDE makes this centralization finally available for Android developers and makes this tool indispensable for a good Android developer.</p><p>This book about Android Studio shows users how to develop and build Android applications with this new IDE. It is not only a getting started book, but also a guide for advanced developers on building their applications faster and more productively. This book will follow a tutorial approach from the basic features to the steps to build for release, including practical examples.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
