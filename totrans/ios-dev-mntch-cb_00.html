Portable devices, such as media players, smartphones, and tablets, have brought huge advancements and changes in the way people communicate, share, and consume digital content. Developers need to be up-to-date with the available platforms these devices work on, if they want to be "part of the game".</p><p>iOS, Apple’s operating system for its own portable devices, is undoubtedly one of the leading portable platforms today. If it weren’t for MonoTouch, .NET developers would have to spend time to learn a new programming language to expand their creativity to the iOS ecosystem.</p><p>This book, through a series of multiple recipes and with an almost equal number of complete projects, will help you become part of this ecosystem, with the help of MonoTouch and C#. When you finish reading it, you will be a capable iOS developer, ready to unleash your creativity to one of the most popular portable platforms today.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text are shown as follows: "Apple provides another base class, the<code class="literal"> UIViewController</code>, which is responsible for managing views."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public override void ViewDidLoad (){
base.ViewDidLoad();
this.myLabel.Text = "View loaded!";
}
</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public override void ViewDidLoad (){
base.ViewDidLoad ();

this.PresentModalViewController(new ModalController(), true);
} ;
}
</pre></div><p>
New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: " Any file that is marked as<span class="strong"><strong> Content</strong></span> is being copied as-is in the application bundle".</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip00"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div>
