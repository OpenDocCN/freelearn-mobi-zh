		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Chapter 5</em>: Sending Text <strong class="bold">Messages</strong></h1>
			<p>Talking on the iPhone is just one of many ways you can communicate with others. Besides talking, another popular way to communicate is through text messages. Unlike phone calls, which require both parties to be free to chat at the same time, text messages allow you to carry on a conversation by typing in messages to each other and responding when it's convenient. Best of all, text messaging works for everyone who has a smartphone. </p>
			<p>Text messaging was originally called <strong class="bold">Short Message Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SMS</strong>) and was designed as a cheaper way to communicate. Sending audio over cellular networks required large amounts of data but sending text required far less data, making it faster and cheaper to use. </p>
			<p>Text messaging has grown beyond alphanumeric characters to include pictures, audio, and video as well as emoji symbols, such as a smiling face. <strong class="bold">Multimedia Messaging Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">MMS</strong>) is an expanded version of text messaging that lets you share all types of data with others. </p>
			<p>Whatever it's called, the basic idea is to send text, pictures, audio, or video to your friends without making an actual phone call. On the iPhone, you send and receive text messages through the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you'll learn different ways to send and use text messages on an iPhone. Some of the topics covered include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sending and receiving text messages</li>
				<li>Sending pictures</li>
				<li>Sending emojis and audio</li>
				<li>Sending video</li>
				<li>Sending animated drawings</li>
				<li>Sending money through Apple Pay</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you don't want to make a phone call, or if you live in an area that charges extra for cellular data, consider sending a text message as a cheap and fast way to communicate with others.<a id="_idTextAnchor246"/><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/><a id="_idTextAnchor248"/><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>Understanding text messages</h1>
			<p>Text messages work by <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>sending data to and from the phone number of a smartphone. That means you can't send or receive text messages to or from a landline telephone that requires a cable plugged into the wall. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Do not send or read text messages while performing other actions such as driving or walking. Text messages can distract you from seeing obstacles and dangers around you, jeopardizing your own life as well as the lives of others. If you must send or read text messages, make sure you only do so from a safe location where you aren't driving or won't walk into obstacles such as walls or other people, and where you won't pose an obstacle to others.</p>
			<p>You can freely send and receive text messages with any mobile phone that supports text messaging. However, when sending text messages to another iPhone via iMessage, messages will appear in a blue bubble. When sending text messages from any other mobile phone (such as an Android phone) or when using SMS from an iPhone, text messages will appear in a green bubble, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.1</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt=" Figure 5.1 – Blue and green text message examples&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.01_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>

			<p class="figure-caption"> Figure 5.1 – Blue and green text message examples</p>
			<p>One advantage of sending text<a id="_idIndexMarker277"/> messages to iPhone users is that you can verify when your message has been received by another iPhone. That way, you know for sure that your text message went through, which is impossible to verify when sending text messages using SMS.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>Sending a text message</h2>
			<p>Text messages are sent to<a id="_idIndexMarker278"/> phone numbers, so it's usually best to store someone's name and phone number in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. That way, you can send a message to an actual person's name. </p>
			<p>If you do not want to store a name and phone number in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app, you can still send a text message by typing the person's phone number before sending the text message. This method is clumsy since it requires typing a complete phone number, but it can be handy if you don't want to store a person's name and phone number in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app for any reason.</p>
			<p>To send a text message by typing in a mobile phone number, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> icon on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the new message icon at the upper-right corner of the screen. A <strong class="bold">New Message</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.2</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.2 – The new message icon and the New Message screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/><a id="_idTextAnchor253"/></p><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – The new message icon and the New Message screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap in the <strong class="bold">To:</strong> text field and <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>type a mobile phone number, including any area code or country code. Alternatively, tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> sign inside the circle at the far right of the <strong class="bold">To:</strong> text field to display any names currently stored in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. From this list, you can tap a person's name and mobile phone number to send a text message to.</li>
				<li>Tap your text in the <strong class="bold">Text Message</strong> text field, and then tap the send icon at the far right when you're done, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.3</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.3 – The Text Message text field and send icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.03_B14100.jpg"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/></p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – The Text Message text field and send icon</p>
			<p>Most people just send plain text, but you can also send pictures as well. This lets you capture a picture using your iPhone's camera and <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>send that image by text message.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Sending pictures as a text message</h2>
			<p>Once you've defined where to <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>send your text message (by typing a specific mobile phone number or choosing a mobile phone number stored in your<a id="_idIndexMarker282"/> <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app), you can type text to send. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, you might want to send a picture as well.</p>
			<p>This picture can be any picture stored in your iPhone's <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app, or it can be any image you capture using the iPhone camera. To send a picture in a text message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app and type in a mobile phone number or choose a mobile phone number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</li>
				<li>Tap the camera icon that appears to the left of the text message icon, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.4</em>. Tapping the camera icon displays the Camera screen:<div><img alt="Figure 5.4 – The camera icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – The camera icon</p></li>
				<li>Aim your iPhone's camera at an image and tap the white button at the bottom center of the screen. Alternatively, tap the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app icon at the upper-left corner of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.5</em>, to open the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app so that you can select an image: <div><img alt="Figure 5.5 – The Camera screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5 – The Camera screen</p><p>Whether you capture<a id="_idIndexMarker283"/> an image through the camera or choose <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>an image stored in the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app, your chosen image appears in a text message bubble, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.6</em>:</p><div><img alt="Figure 5.6 – An image selected to send as a text message&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6 – An image selected to send as a text message</p></li>
				<li>Tap in the text field and type a<a id="_idIndexMarker285"/> message to send with your picture (sending text with a picture is optional). </li>
				<li>(Optional:) Tap the<a id="_idIndexMarker286"/> close icon (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) at the upper-right corner of your selected picture if you do not want to send the picture after all. </li>
				<li>Tap the send icon at the far right of the text message field to send your chosen picture.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sending pictures can be fun, but you might also want to send emojis as well to express your mood.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Sending emojis as a text message</h2>
			<p>Emojis represent silly <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>and fun icons of different images, such as animals <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>or smiley faces. Many people send emojis as pictorial comments or in addition to text to spice up a text message. </p>
			<p>To send an emoji in a text message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app and type in a mobile phone number or choose a mobile phone number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</li>
				<li>Tap in the <strong class="bold">Text Message</strong> text field so<a id="_idIndexMarker289"/> that the virtual keyboard appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the globe icon at the bottom-left corner of the virtual keyboard, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.7</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.7 – The globe icon on the virtual keyboard displays different keyboard options&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.07_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7 – The globe icon on the virtual keyboard displays different keyboard options</p><p>You may need to tap<a id="_idIndexMarker290"/> this globe icon multiple times to cycle through any other virtual keyboards that may appear. A list of emojis appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.8</em>:</p><div><img alt="Figure 5.8 – The emoji keyboard&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.08_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8 – The emoji keyboard</p></li>
				<li>Tap an emoji category at the<a id="_idIndexMarker291"/> bottom of the screen to view a different set of emojis, such as smiley faces or sports images. You can also <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>swipe left or right to view different emoji categories.</li>
				<li>Tap on an emoji that you want to send. Your chosen emoji appears in the text bubble. </li>
				<li>Tap in the text field and type a message to send with your emoji (sending text with an emoji is optional). </li>
				<li>Tap the send icon at the far right of the text message field to send your chosen emoji.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Emojis represent different<a id="_idIndexMarker293"/> ways to express yourself in pictures instead of words. Some people just send emojis, while others send text and emojis. For another way to send pictures as text messages, consider using stickers as well.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Sending stickers as a text message</h2>
			<p>Stickers represent silly <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>and fun icons of different images, such as animals or smiley faces. Many people also send stickers as pictorial comments or in<a id="_idIndexMarker295"/> addition to text to spice up a text message. </p>
			<p>To send a sticker in a text message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app and type in a mobile phone number, or choose a mobile phone number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</li>
				<li>Tap the applications icon to display a list of options, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.9</em> (skip this step if the list of options is already visible):<div><img alt="Figure 5.9 – The applications icon shows/hides a list of options&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.9 – The applications icon shows/hides a list of options</p></li>
				<li>Tap the stickers icon to display a list of different stickers, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.10</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.10 – The stickers icon displays different stickers to select&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.10_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.10 – The stickers icon displays different stickers to select</p></li>
				<li>Tap on a sticker to send. Your selected sticker appears in a text bubble, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.11</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.11 – Sending a sticker&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.11_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.11 – Sending a sticker</p></li>
				<li>Tap in the text field and type a message to send with your sticker (sending text with a sticker is optional). </li>
				<li>(Optional:) Tap the<a id="_idIndexMarker296"/> close icon (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) at the upper-right corner of your<a id="_idIndexMarker297"/> selected sticker if you do not want to send the picture after all. </li>
				<li>Tap the send icon at the far right of the text message field to send your chosen sticker.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Stickers are just another way to send cartoon images to others. While you can use the pre-designed stickers that Apple provides, you can also customize your own stickers. That way, you can make cartoon images of yourself or others.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>Creating Memojis</h2>
			<p>Rather than<a id="_idIndexMarker298"/> sending pre-drawn stickers, take a moment to design your own stickers, called Memojis. Even if you aren't artistically inclined, you can simply choose different colors and options to create a Memoji that looks good, whether you have <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>any drawing talent or not. In just a few minutes, you'll be surprised at how creative you can get making your own Memoji that either looks like you or looks like a cartoon version of another person.</p>
			<p>To create a Memoji, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app and type in a mobile phone number, or choose a mobile phone number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</li>
				<li>Tap the applications icon to display a list of options (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.9</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the stickers icon to display a list of different stickers (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.10</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon at the upper-left corner of the stickers screen. The Memoji creation screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.12</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.12 – Creating a custom Memoji&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.12 – Creating a custom Memoji</p></li>
				<li>Tap a <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>category, such as <strong class="bold">Skin</strong>, <strong class="bold">Hairstyle</strong>, <strong class="bold">Brows</strong>, <strong class="bold">Eyes</strong>, <strong class="bold">Head</strong>, <strong class="bold">Nose</strong>, <strong class="bold">Mouth</strong>, <strong class="bold">Ears</strong>, <strong class="bold">Facial Hair</strong>, <strong class="bold">Eyewear</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Headwear</strong>. Each<a id="_idIndexMarker301"/> category will display different options to select so that you can further customize your Memoji, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.13</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.13 – Choosing different options for customizing a Memoji&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.13_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.13 – Choosing different options for customizing a Memoji</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong> when <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>you've finished creating your<a id="_idIndexMarker303"/> Memoji. After you've created at least one custom Memoji, you can select and view its variations any time you tap the stickers icon, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.14</em>:</li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.14 – Viewing variations of a custom Memoji</p>
			<p>Once you've created one or<a id="_idIndexMarker304"/> more custom Memojis, you may later want to<a id="_idIndexMarker305"/> duplicate them, edit them, or delete them altogether. To duplicate, edit, or delete a<a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> Memoji, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/><strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app and type in a mobile phone number, or choose a mobile phone<a id="_idIndexMarker308"/> number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</li>
				<li>Tap the applications icon to display a list of options (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.9</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the stickers icon to display a list of different stickers (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.10</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the Memoji you want to edit. The three-dot icon inside a circle appears at the upper-left corner.</li>
				<li>Tap this three-dot icon. A Memoji editing screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.15</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.15 – The Memoji editing screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.15 – The Memoji editing screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap an option (<strong class="bold">New Memoji</strong>, <strong class="bold">Edit</strong>, <strong class="bold">Duplicate</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Delete</strong>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Memojis are a<a id="_idIndexMarker309"/> unique way to <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>send graphical images through a text message. For<a id="_idIndexMarker311"/> those who prefer exercising their artistic skills, you can also send drawings made with your fingertip.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Sending a Digital Touch drawing as a text message</h2>
			<p>Digital Touch is a way to <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>draw simple pictures or letters with your fingertip. Then, you can send these simple finger drawings or writings as <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>a text message. </p>
			<p>As an option, you can also take a picture and add drawings to that picture. That way, you can highlight different parts of a picture, such as pointing out a problem or a specific item that you want someone to see.</p>
			<p>To send a Digital Touch image in a text message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app and type in a mobile phone number, or choose a mobile phone number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</li>
				<li>Tap the applications icon to display a list of options (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.9</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the Digital Touch icon to display a drawing area, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.16</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.16 – The Digital Touch drawing area&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.16_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.16 – The Digital Touch drawing area</p></li>
				<li>Tap the color on the left side to display other colors. Then, tap the color you want to use. When <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>you select a color, a camera icon appears on the right side of the drawing area.</li>
				<li>Tap the camera icon<a id="_idIndexMarker315"/> that appears on the right side of the drawing area. A Digital Touch camera screen appears, letting you add drawings to an image that you can record, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.17</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.17 – Adding Digital Touch drawings to a camera image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.17 – Adding Digital Touch drawings to a camera image</p></li>
				<li>Tap a color<a id="_idIndexMarker316"/> and draw<a id="_idIndexMarker317"/> an image. </li>
				<li>Tap the white button to capture a still image, or tap the red button to capture a video. A blue <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>send icon appears at the bottom-right corner of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the send icon. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sending drawings that <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>can include pictures can be fun, but another way to send a message is through audio.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>Sending audio as a text message</h2>
			<p>Sometimes, typing a message<a id="_idIndexMarker320"/> can be troublesome or simply not<a id="_idIndexMarker321"/> possible due to physical limitations. For another way to communicate through text messaging, send audio clips. That way, you can speak your message and the other person can hear your message.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Sending audio as a text message is only possible when texting another iPhone user. You cannot send audio to someone using a different smartphone, such as an Android device.</p>
			<p>To send audio in a text message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app and type in a mobile phone number, or choose a mobile phone number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. Make sure the person you're texting has an iPhone, which you can identify by seeing previous text messages appearing in blue text bubbles.</li>
				<li>Tap the applications icon to display a list of options (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.9</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap and hold the audio button that appears at the far right of the text message field, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.18</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.18 – The audio button&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.18 – The audio button</p></li>
				<li>Speak your <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>message while continuing to hold down the <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>audio button. When you're done speaking, release the audio button. Your audio message appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.19</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.19 – A recorded audio message ready to be sent&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.19_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.19 – A recorded audio message ready to be sent</p></li>
				<li>(Optional:) Tap the close button (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) to the left of the audio recording if you want to delete the audio recording without sending it.</li>
				<li>Tap the <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>send icon (an up arrow) to send your audio. Your audio appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.20</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.20 – A sent audio recording&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.20_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.20 – A sent audio recording</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Keep</strong> if you want <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>to save your audio recording. If you do not tap <strong class="bold">Keep</strong>, your audio recording will disappear after a few minutes.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Audio recordings make it easy to send messages without typing. For another way to send messages without typing, try sending animated activity images, which display simple animation, such as a rotating soccer ball or a waving flag. These animated images can spice up your text message and provide a fun addition to any text you might also want to type.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Sending animated fitness images as a text message</h2>
			<p>Animation can catch <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>someone's eye much faster than a static image. If you want to add animated images to a text message, you can choose<a id="_idIndexMarker327"/> from the fitness category, which displays moving images.</p>
			<p>To send an animated fitness image in a text message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app and type in a mobile phone number, or choose a mobile phone number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</li>
				<li>Tap the applications icon to display a list of options (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.9</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the fitness icon to view a list of animated images, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.21</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.21 – The fitness animated images&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.21_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.21 – The fitness animated images</p></li>
				<li>Tap an animated image. Your chosen animated image appears in a text message bubble, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.22</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.22 – Sending an animated image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.22_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.22 – Sending an animated image</p></li>
				<li>(Optional:) Tap the close button (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) if you change your mind about sending the animated image.</li>
				<li>(Optional:) Type<a id="_idIndexMarker328"/> some text to send along with your animated image.</li>
				<li>Tap the send icon<a id="_idIndexMarker329"/> to send your animated image.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Let's take a look at another kind of animated image that we can send via text messages. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>Sending animated images as a text message</h2>
			<p>Since a picture is worth<a id="_idIndexMarker330"/> a thousand words, you might want to send an animated image as a text message. Your iPhone comes with a collection of<a id="_idIndexMarker331"/> animated images, so you can select the one that best matches your mood. To send an animated image as a text message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app and type in a mobile phone number, or choose a mobile phone number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</li>
				<li>Tap the applications icon to display a list of options (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.9</em>). You may need to swipe left or right to see all the available options. </li>
				<li>Tap the images icon to view a list of animated images, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.23</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.23 – Choosing an animated image&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.23_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.23 – Choosing an animated image</p></li>
				<li>(Optional:) Tap the close button (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) if you change your mind about sending the animated image.</li>
				<li>(Optional:) Type some text to send along with your animated image.</li>
				<li>Tap the send icon to send<a id="_idIndexMarker332"/> your animated image.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sending animated<a id="_idIndexMarker333"/> images can be a fun way to share your feelings and thoughts without typing. If you're listening to a particular song that reflects your mood, you can share your music taste with others as well without typing a thing.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor264"/>Sending a song you're currently playing as a text message</h2>
			<p>Many people use their iPhones<a id="_idIndexMarker334"/> to play music that they can enjoy while moving around or sitting in place. As another fun way to share your feelings with <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>others, you can let others know which songs you recently played without typing a single letter yourself.</p>
			<p>To let others know your musical tastes in a text message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app and type in a mobile phone number, or choose a mobile phone number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</li>
				<li>Tap the applications icon to display a list of options (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.9</em>). You may need to swipe left or <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>right to see all the available options. </li>
				<li>Tap the music icon to <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>view a list of recently played songs, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.24</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.24 – Choosing from a list of recently played music&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.24_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.24 – Choosing from a list of recently played music</p></li>
				<li>Tap a recently played song. Your iPhone automatically types text listing the song you chose, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.25</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.25 – Text automatically created after choosing a recently played song&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.25_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.25 – Text automatically created after choosing a recently played song</p></li>
				<li>Tap the send icon to<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> send your text message.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sending your currently<a id="_idIndexMarker339"/> playing song can be fun, but sometimes you may want to send money as well, which you can do through Apple Pay (only available in certain regions of the world). By sending money through Apple Pay, you can easily transfer cash between iPhone users.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>Sending money through a text message</h2>
			<p>These days, more people are relying on <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>digital cash instead of <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>carrying coins or paper bills, and for iPhone users, one of the most popular ways of carrying digital cash is through Apple Pay.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Apple Pay is only available for iPhone<a id="_idIndexMarker342"/> or iPad users who have previously set up Apple Pay. That means you cannot send money through Apple Pay to Android devices or any non-iOS device. Both you and the recipient must also set up Apple Cash as well, which you can do when sending money through Apple Pay for the first time. Apple Cash will need to be linked to a debit card. Also, Apple Pay may not be available in all countries and regions</p>
			<p>To send money through Apple Pay with a<a id="_idIndexMarker343"/> text message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app and type in<a id="_idIndexMarker344"/> a mobile phone<a id="_idIndexMarker345"/> number, or choose a mobile phone number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. Make sure the person you're texting has an iPhone, which you can identify by seeing previous text messages appearing in blue text bubbles.</li>
				<li>Tap the applications icon to display a list of options (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.9</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the Apple Pay icon. An Apple Pay screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.26</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.26 – Choosing an amount to send through Apple Pay&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.26_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.26 – Choosing an amount to send through Apple Pay</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">–</strong> or <strong class="bold">+</strong> keys to increment the amount you want to send.</li>
				<li>(Optional:) Tap <strong class="bold">Show Keypad</strong> to display a numeric<a id="_idIndexMarker346"/> keypad so that you can type in the precise <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>amount to send, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.27</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.27 – Choosing an amount to send through Apple Pay with a numeric keypad&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.27_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.27 – Choosing an amount to send through Apple Pay with a numeric keypad</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Pay</strong>, and then tap<a id="_idIndexMarker348"/> the send icon.</li>
				<li>Authorize the payment through Touch ID or Face ID.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sending money through Apple Pay can be <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>handy for sharing cash. However, sometimes you may just want to keep in touch with friends by sharing activities. </p>
			<p>Sending text messages can be fun, but receiving them can be even better since it means other people want to communicate with you. It's time to learn how to read and respond to messages that you rece<a id="_idTextAnchor266"/><a id="_idTextAnchor267"/>ive.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor268"/>Receiving and responding to text messages</h1>
			<p>Each time you receive a text <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>message, you'll see a notification number at the upper-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> icon on the Home Screen. This number displays the<a id="_idIndexMarker351"/> number of unread messages you've received, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.28</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.28 – The Messages icon displaying notifications of new messages&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.28_B14100.jpg"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.28 – The <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> icon displaying notifications of new messages</p>
			<p>If you're using your iPhone when you receive a message, you'll see a brief message at the top of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.29</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.29 – Getting real-time notifications of an incoming message&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.29_B14100.jpg"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.29 – Getting real-time notifications of an incoming message</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app lists <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>everyone who has contacted you in the past. If you have <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>added their names and mobile phone numbers in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app, that person's name will appear. Otherwise, only that person's mobile phone number will appear.</p>
			<p>When you receive a text message, you can read it by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app on the Home Screen. A blue dot appears to the left of any text message conversations containing unread messages, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.30</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.30 – Blue dots identify conversations containing unread messages&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.30_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.30 – Blue dots identify conversations containing unread messages</p></li>
				<li>Tap a conversation that<a id="_idIndexMarker354"/> contains the messages you want to read. A list of past messages appears.</li>
				<li>Scroll down to view the <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>latest message you've received from someone.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Text Message</strong> text field, type in your text, and tap the send icon to send a response back to that person. </li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor269"/>Responding to text messages with symbols</h2>
			<p>While text messages are meant to be<a id="_idIndexMarker356"/> short, even typing a few words can be troublesome. That's why the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app offers common symbols (such as a thumbs up or thumbs down) to let others know what you think without having to type a reply.</p>
			<p>To respond to someone's message with a symbol, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app on the Home Screen. A list of message conversations appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on the conversation that contains a message you want to respond to.</li>
				<li>Press and hold your fingertip over a message that you want to respond to. A list of symbols appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.31</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.31 – Press and hold over a message to display symbols&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.31_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.31 – Press and hold over a message to display symbols</p></li>
				<li>Tap a symbol to send it in response to your chosen text message. (Note that in <em class="italic">Figure 5.31</em>, you also have the option of choosing <strong class="bold">Copy</strong> to copy an entire text message. That way, you can paste it anywhere you like, such as in the Notes app, a word processor, an email, or <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>another text message.)</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor270"/>Hiding a text message conversation</h2>
			<p>If you belong to a particularly<a id="_idIndexMarker358"/> active conversation, you may receive messages constantly, which can be annoying if your iPhone constantly beeps or vibrates each time you get a new message. To mute any type of alerts when you receive a new message in a particular conversation, you can choose to hide alerts. </p>
			<p>To hide alerts for a conversation in the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app on the Home Screen. A list of message conversations appears.</li>
				<li>Swipe left on the conversation you want to modify. A blue hide alerts and a red delete button appear, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.32</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 5.32 – Left swiping on a conversation displays a delete option&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.32_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.32 – Left swiping on a conversation displays a delete option</p></li>
				<li>Tap hide alerts. From now on, you won't receive any alerts when a new message arrives in this conversation. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>To turn alerts back on again, simply repeat the preceding steps, except instead of choosing hide alerts, you'll be able to choose a show alerts button.</p>
			<p>If you no longer want to keep certain conversations because you don't need them or won't be communicating with that person again, you can choose to delete a conversation altogether.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor271"/>Deleting a text message conversation</h2>
			<p>Sometimes, you may have a <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>conversation with a friend or co-worker, but later you no longer need to communicate with that person again. To clear the number of conversations displayed in the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app, you can delete them.</p>
			<p>To delete a conversation in the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app on the Home Screen. A list of message conversations appears.</li>
				<li>Swipe left on the conversation you want to modify. A hide alerts and a delete button appear (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.32</em>). An action sheet appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.33</em>, asking you to verify that you want to delete the entire conversation and any messages stored inside:<div><img alt="Figure 5.33 – An action sheet asking to verify deleting an entire Messages conversation&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_5.33_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.33 – An action sheet asking to verify deleting an entire <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> conversation</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app deletes your chosen conversation for good.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Go through your conversations periodically and delete the ones you no longer need. If you feel some messages might be important, simply copy and paste them to save them for future reference. </p>
			<p>In general, delete any unnecessary conversations so that the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> app will only contain conversatio<a id="_idTextAnchor272"/>ns and messages that<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> are actually important to you.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor273"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Text messaging is a common way to communicate quickly and easily with anyone with a mobile phone. While you can always share your thoughts and ideas as text, don't feel limited to just typing. Consider sending pictures, audio, or even digital cash through Apple Pay. </p>
			<p>Text messaging is meant to help you stay in touch with important people or information, so consider hiding alerts if certain text messaging conversations alert you too often. Periodically, go through your text messaging conversations and delete the ones you no longer need so that you can focus attention on those conversations you currently want and need right now.</p>
			<p>Text messaging can be a great way to communicate with others, but in the next chapter, you'll learn how to talk to Siri, Apple's voice assistant, who can answer questions and help you search the internet without you having to type anything at all.</p>
