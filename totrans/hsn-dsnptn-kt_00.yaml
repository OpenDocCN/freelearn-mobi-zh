- en: Design patterns enable you as a developer to speed up the development process
    by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Reusing design patterns helps
    prevent complex issues that can cause major problems and improves your code base,
    promotes code reuse, and makes the architecture more robust.

- en: The mission of this book is to ease the adoption of design patterns in Kotlin
    and provide good practices for programmers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book begins by showing you the practical aspects of smarter coding in Kotlin,
    explaining the basic Kotlin syntax and the impact of design patterns. Furthermore,
    the book provides an in-depth explanation of the classic design patterns, such
    as Creational, Structural, and Behavioral, before heading into functional programming.
    It then takes you through Reactive and Concurrent patterns, teaching you about
    Streams, Threads, and Coroutines to write better code. Toward the end, you will
    learn about the latest trends in architecture, exploring the design patterns for
    microservices, and discuss the considerations when choosing between different
    architectures, such as microservices and MVC.

    faced while developing applications and be comfortable working on scalable and
    maintainable projects of any size.
