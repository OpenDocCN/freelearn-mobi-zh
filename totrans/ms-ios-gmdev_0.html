<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "We will add another <code class="literal">NSString</code> class at the top of our <code class="literal">MultiplayerHelper.m</code> file."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">- (void)match:(GKMatch *)match didFailWithError:(NSError *)error {
    
    if (_match != match) return;
    
    NSLog(@"Match failed with error: %@", error.localizedDescription);

    [_delegate matchEnded];
}</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">- (void)update:(NSTimeInterval)delta {
    
    CGPoint gravity = CGPointMake(0.0, -450.0);
    
    CGPoint gravityStep = CGPointMultiplyScalar(gravity, delta);
    
<strong>   CGPoint movingForward = CGPointMake(750.0, 0.0);</strong>
<strong>   CGPoint movingForwardStep = CGPointMultiplyScalar(walking, delta);</strong>

    self.velocity = CGPointAdd(self.velocity, gravityStep);</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "For this project, we are—obviously—going to select <strong>iOS</strong> | <strong>Application</strong> | <strong>Single View Application</strong> and then click on <strong>Next</strong>.".</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
