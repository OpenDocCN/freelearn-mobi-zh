            <p>Now that you have learned Swift, which will help you to understand a lot of the boilerplate
               code you will see later, it is time to start building our <em>Let's Eat</em> app. Let's begin by getting an overview of what we are going to build. We will review
               the finished product and then get into how to build this app. Before we start, there
               will be a lot of new terms and things with which you may or may not be familiar. Learn
               as much as you can and do not let the finer details stop you from progressing.
            </p>
            
            <p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>

            <p>View Controllers (<kbd>UIViewControllers</kbd>) are blank scenes that you can use to hold other UI elements. They give you the ability
               to create a custom interface.

            <p>A Table View Controller (<kbd>UITableViewController</kbd>), which inherits from <kbd>UIViewController</kbd>, is one of the most common UI elements and is used to display a list of items. For
               example, Apple's Settings screen uses Table View Controller to display the list of
               settings a user can access and change:

            <p>Collection View Controllers (<kbd>UICollectionViewControllers</kbd>) are typically used when you want to display elements within a grid. They are highly
               customizable and, because of that, are becoming more popular in non-grid based layouts.
            </p>
            
            <p>The App Store, for example, currently uses <kbd>UICollectionViewControllers</kbd> for both its featured page and its app detail page:

            <p>A Navigation Controller (<kbd>UINavigationController</kbd>) is a UI element that allows you to build a drill-down interface for hierarchical
               content. When you embed a Navigation Controller into a View Controller, Table View
               Controller, or Collection View Controller, it manages navigation from one controller
               to another controller.

            <p>The Tab Bar Controller (<kbd>UITabBarController</kbd>) manages an array of View Controllers. Our <em>Let's Eat</em> app will use a Tab Bar Controller. This controller will give us the ability to have
               navigation for our app with minimal setup.
            </p>
            
            <p>Apple has a few apps with which you might be familiar that use the Tab Bar Controller:</p>

            <p>A <kbd>UITabBarController</kbd> can only have five tabs on the iPhone. If your <kbd>UITabBarController</kbd> has more than five tabs on the iPhone, the fifth tab and any after that move underneath
               a <span class="packt_screen">More</span> button:

            <p>A storyboard is a file displays a visual representation of your app's UI. This is
               what a storyboard looks like for an app:

            <p>Storyboards let you create your entire app visually using View Controllers, Table
               View Controllers, and Collection View Controllers as scenes. Along with creating your
               app visually, you can connect scenes and set up transitions between scenes using segues.

            <p class="packt_figure">Segues are used to connect one controller to another controller. In the storyboard,
               segues are represented by an arrow with an icon:

            <p>Segues also give you the ability to specify a transition from one scene to another,
               with very little to no programming.

            <p>Auto layout is an excellent tool that allows you to support different screen sizes
               and device rotation. With auto layout, you can set different constraints on UI elements
               for it to adjust to changes in size and rotation. Using auto layout in your app allows
               you to use one storyboard for all devices.

            <p>MVC is a standard software design pattern, which is a solution for commonly occurring
               problems within software design. Apple has built iOS apps on the MVC design pattern.
               This pattern divides our app into three camps known as the Model, View, and Controller.
               We will cover this in detail later in this book.

            <p class="packt_figure">The <em>Let's Eat</em> app that we are building is a restaurant reservation app that allows users to find
               restaurants in a specific area and create reservations from within the app (although
               our app does not book those reservations). I chose a restaurant reservation app for
               the purposes of the lessons in this book, because most of the new iOS 11 features
               work well together in such an app. The app covers a lot of different aspects from
               maps to iMessage extensions. Let's take a look at the overall flow of the app, so
               that, as we build, you have a good idea of the direction we are heading in:

            <p>When the app launches, you will see the <span class="packt_screen">Explore</span> tab. This tab will allow users to pick a particular cuisine that they would like
               and to select a specific predefined location. Let's break down each component in this
               view:

            <p>For this screen, we will work with an empty View Controller, which is where all of
               our UI components live. As you can see, this view in our app is designed to be a grid,
               so we will be using a Collection View Controller. We will be setting up this Collection
               View Controller ourselves.
            </p>
            
            <p>When I build apps, I typically start with a blank Collection View or Table View, because
               it gives more flexibility in my code as well as with my user interface.

            <p>The Locations view is a list of cities that is accessed from the <span class="packt_screen">Explore</span> tab. We load this list of cities from a local file-and, if the user selects a city,
               the app loads all of the restaurants from that area:

            <p>In Restaurant listings, we see restaurants in the area by the selected cuisine:</p>

            <p>We will be covering both <kbd>UICollectionViews</kbd> and <kbd>UITableViews</kbd> in this book, but, as an introduction, you should know that <kbd>UICollectionViews</kbd> are very powerful. The reason they are powerful is that you can customize them to
               look how you want. For example, the App Store detail is a custom <kbd>UICollectionView</kbd>.
            </p>
            
            <p>One great feature when using <kbd>UICollectionView</kbd> is that, when you are building a universal app like this one, you can make your view
               look like a list for the iPhone, but appear as a grid on the iPad with minimal effort.

            <p>Our Restaurant detail has more information about the restaurant. This view is built
               using a <kbd>UITableView</kbd> that uses static cells:

            <p>Now that we have gotten a tour of the app, we are going to build the <em>Let's Eat</em> app. First, we need to create the app, then work on the UI and lastly, design our
               app in a storyboard.
            </p>
            
            <p>For the initial setup of the app, we will look at some basics of iOS, starting with
               creating a new project.

            <p>In this chapter, we covered useful terms that we will use throughout the book. We
               also looked at what we are going to build throughout the app and now we have a good
               idea of what the app will look like.
            </p>
            
            <p>Next, let's dig in and start working inside of storyboard and getting the UI of the
               application set up. In the next few chapters, we will work strictly in the storyboard
               to get our app set up. Once we have everything set up, we will focus on code throughout
               the rest of the book.
