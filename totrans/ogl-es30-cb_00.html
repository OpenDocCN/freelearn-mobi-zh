It is used for visualizing 2D and 3D graphics with the modern programmable graphics pipeline. "Write once, use anywhere" is truly the power behind OpenGL ES, which has made it an embedded industry standard. OpenGL ES 3.0 is a cross-platform graphics library and opens its gates to many other cutting-edge technologies, such as parallel processing libraries (OpenCL) and digital image processing (OpenCV) that works in conjunction with many other open community solutions.</p><p>The main strength of this book is that it covers development of real-time rendering graphics and visualization development using OpenGL ES 3.0 from scratch. It lets the user know how to define the framework for the OpenGL ES 3.0 application. These are some of the techniques that make this book entirely different from other books available on the market. The idea behind this book is to give you an in-depth knowledge of this new version of graphics API and use it to implement computer graphics fundamentals and advance concepts from scratch using Android and iOS as embedded platforms. This book covers a lot of ground, from basic concepts of modern 3D graphics to advanced real-time rendering techniques using OpenGL ES 3.0.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. OpenGL ES 3.0 on Android/iOS">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>OpenGL ES 3.0 on Android/iOS</em></span>, takes you through the process of how to develop the Android and iOS OpenGL ES 3.0 application. This chapter shows you how to load and compile a shader program apart from the process to program shaders in GL shading language 3.0.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. OpenGL ES 3.0 Essentials">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>OpenGL ES 3.0 Essentials</em></span>, provides you with a detailed description of the basic concepts that are required to understand 3D graphics and implement them using OpenGL ES 3.0. We will build prototypes using the GLPI framework and implement touch events and scene with model, view, and projection analogy.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. New Features of OpenGL ES 3.0">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>New Features of OpenGL ES 3.0</em></span>, helps you understand the various new features introduced in OpenGL ES 3.0 and GL shading language 3.0. This chapter tells you how to manage variable attributes with qualifiers and render multiple objects with geometry instancing and primitives with primitive restart.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Working with Meshes">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Meshes</em></span>, teaches you how to create simple meshes using Blender, which is an open source 3D modeling tool. In addition, this chapter covers various aspects of the 3D mesh model that will be helpful to render them in 3D graphics. This chapter also teaches how to use the created mesh model in OpenGL ES 3.0 applications.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Light and Materials">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Light and Materials</em></span>, introduces the concepts of light and materials in 3D graphics. It also covers some important common illumination techniques, such as Phong and Gouraud shading, which will help you implement realistic looking lighting models in computer graphics.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Working with Shaders">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Shaders</em></span>, gives you an in-depth understanding on the shaders programming technique. It discusses various techniques that can be implemented using the vertex and fragment shader, revealing their capabilities. This chapter helps you play with fragments by programing them using procedural shaders.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Textures and Mapping Techniques">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Textures and Mapping Techniques</em></span>, sheds some light on textures, which is a very interesting part of the 3D computer graphics study. Texturing is a technique in which the surface of a 3D mesh model is painted with static images. This chapter is all about image texturing and explains its various applications in the field of 3D computer graphics. This chapter covers ample techniques on mapping, such as environment, bump, displacement mapping, and so on.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Font Rendering">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Font Rendering</em></span>, provides a detailed description on how to build the font engine and render different languages with Harfbuzz and text on Head Up Display (HUD).</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Postscreen Processing and Image Effects">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Postscreen Processing and Image Effects</em></span>, unfolds the endless possibilities of scene-based effects and image-based effects, which are widely used in the field of data visualization and after effects. This includes applications such as edge detection, image blurring, real-time glow, emboss effect, and so on.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Scene Management with Scene Graphs">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scene Management with Scene Graphs</em></span>, introduces a scene graph paradigm that allows you to program and manage complex scenes efficiently. This chapter will help you create a small architecture that allows you to manage multiple scenes. Each scene consists of multiple lights, cameras, and models.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Anti-aliasing Techniques">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Anti-aliasing Techniques</em></span>, tells you how to implement fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA), adaptive anti-aliasing, and anti-aliased circle geometry.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Real-time Shadows and Particle System">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Real-time Shadows and Particle System</em></span>, shows you how to implement shadows using shadow mapping and improve it with percentile closer filtering and variance shadow mapping technique. It also discusses the basics of particle rendering. This chapter teaches you the transform feedback with sync objects and fence, which help you implement high-performance, GPU-driven, and real-time graphics applications.</p><p><a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Supplementary Information on OpenGL ES 3.0">Appendix</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Supplementary Information on OpenGL ES 3.0</em></span>, covers all the basic requirements that we need to develop OpenGL ES 3.0 applications on the iOS and Android platforms. This chapter teaches you two ways of Android application development with Android ADT and Android Studio. This also provides you a simple overview of OpenGL ES 3.0 architectures. This overview also helps you understand the technical jargon of various computer graphics terminology.</p></div></div>
