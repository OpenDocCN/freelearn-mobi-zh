			<p>Welcome to <em class="italic">Software Architecture with Kotlin</em>, a comprehensive guide designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to build robust software systems using Kotlin. As the demand for efficient and scalable applications continues to grow, understanding architectural principles becomes indispensable for engineers <span class="No-Break">and architects.</span></p>
			<p>In this book, we will break down a selection of software architecture styles into basic components by the first principle, so these components can be rearranged and combined to solve real-world problems. Each chapter focuses on specific areas, introducing key concepts, best practices, and real-world examples illustrating how to apply these principles <span class="No-Break">in Kotlin.</span></p>
			<p>Whether you are a seasoned engineer looking to deepen your understanding of software architecture or a newcomer eager to learn, this book provides practical insights that can be immediately applied. You will find hands-on exercises, code snippets, and case studies that will help you grasp complex ideas and implement them in <span class="No-Break">your projects.</span></p>
			<p>As you embark on this journey, I encourage you to experiment with the concepts presented here. Software architecture is more than patterns and styles – it is about creativity, problem-solving, flexibility, and adapting solutions to meet the unique challenges of your applications. Happy reading! </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for software engineers who want to enhance their architectural knowledge and mindset to solve daily engineering problems. Prior experience in engineering will be useful but <span class="No-Break">not essential.</span></p>
			<p>If you have just started learning how to write Kotlin code, are expanding your technical experience from Android development to backend, or are transitioning from writing Java code, you will find this <span class="No-Break">book useful.</span></p>
			<p>If you are a software architect interested in discussing and exploring unique architectural ideas, this is the book <span class="No-Break">for you.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B21737_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">The Essence of Software Architecture</em>, revisits the importance of software architecture and the role of software architects in an organization. It covers how the structure of an organization affects architectural decisions. Then it discusses choosing a framework and the factors to consider in the process. Several industry-standard documents and diagrams are introduced, which will be used for illustrations in <span class="No-Break">subsequent chapters.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor045"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Principles of Software Architecture</em>, explores multiple ways to visualize and quantify software architectures, extracting quality attributes for measurement and analysis. It then delves into three key concepts: the separation of concerns, cohesiveness, and coupling. Popular architecture principles such as SOLID, the Law of Demeter, YAGNI, and future-proofing are also covered. These principles lay the foundation for further exploration of architecture styles in the <span class="No-Break">following chapters.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor067"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Polymorphism and Alternatives</em>, uses a real-life problem and solves it using multiple styles in Kotlin code. It starts with a polymorphic solution, then explores two solutions involving Kotlin sealed classes. Next, a solution using delegation is presented, followed by a functional approach. Finally, all approaches are compared based on system <span class="No-Break">quality attributes.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Peer-to-Peer and Client-Server Architecture</em>, focuses on network communication in distributed systems. It includes a step-by-step guide to implementing a client-server solution with an API-first approach using OpenAPI specifications and the Http4K framework in Kotlin. The chapter then implements a peer-to-peer solution to the same problem and compares the two approaches, discussing which is suitable for <span class="No-Break">different situations.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor125"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring MVC, MVP, and MVVM</em>, shifts focus to frontend applications. Using a sample Android application, we apply MVC, MVP, and MVVM to observe the evolution of the implementation with different architecture styles. The three patterns are compared along with other commonly <span class="No-Break">used styles.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor212"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Microservices, Serverless, and Micro</em><em class="italic">frontends</em>, moves the focus to the backend. This chapter shows how monolithic applications and service-oriented architectures evolve into microservices and nanoservices. It explains how serverless architectures impact modern software systems through cloud provider services. Finally, the frontend counterpart of microservices, the micro-frontend, <span class="No-Break">is discussed.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor255"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Modular and Layered Architectures</em>, starts with three layered architectures—Clean architecture, Hexagonal architecture, and Functional Core Imperative Shell—that have similarities and differences. They are demonstrated and compared using Kotlin code for the same real-life problem. Later, the chapter explores the Connect pattern, providing a modular approach to integrate with <span class="No-Break">remote systems.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor289"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</em>, takes a deep dive into DDD design activities. It starts with basic concepts and terms, then looks at the bigger picture of the domain with Strategic Design. A bounded context is selected for Tactical Design. The chapter also walks through three popular domain modeling activities with a <span class="No-Break">real-life example.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor307"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Event Sourcing and CQRS</em>, extends the DDD practices from the previous chapter into two powerful architecture patterns. It first illustrates the use of Event Sourcing with a real-life example, then explains how CQRS can be applied. Finally, it combines Event Sourcing and CQRS as a solution to the same problem to unlock the potential of both <span class="No-Break">architecture styles.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor334"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Idempotency, Replication, and Recovery Models</em>, discusses three related architectural concepts. It starts with idempotency in distributed systems, providing practical examples of how to implement it. Next, several replication models are explored and compared using the CAP Theorem. The chapter concludes with system recovery, using RAFT leader election as a <span class="No-Break">case study.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor358"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Auditing and Monitoring Models</em>, demonstrates a sample audit trail structure in Kotlin that can be used by multiple services but centrally recorded. It also discusses various monitoring data formats and approaches for collecting data for monitoring purposes. The chapter covers structural and contextual logging with Kotlin code, as well as automated alerts, incident management, <span class="No-Break">and metrics.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor379"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Performance and Scalability</em>, focuses on measuring performance using defined metrics. It showcases performance testing through basic approaches and micro-benchmarking. The chapter guides you through performance testing workflows while discussing strategies for performance improvement using Kotlin code. Additionally, a voting system is used to illustrate the process of enhancing performance and scaling <span class="No-Break">the system.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor418"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Testing</em>, explores the role of Quality Assurance. It examines various testing methods within the Testing Pyramid and highlights best practices for each type. The chapter includes a step-by-step journey through a Test-Driven Development exercise with the <span class="No-Break">Kotest framework.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor442"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Security</em>, focuses on safeguarding software systems and their data from malicious attacks. It starts with securing network communication using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Then, the chapter covers Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for user identity verification. It also addresses common methods of authorization and data entitlement, techniques for hiding and anonymizing sensitive data, and various network security approaches. The chapter concludes with a discussion of DevSecOps and a Threat <span class="No-Break">Modeling exercise.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B21737_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor474"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Beyond Architecture</em>, covers various engineering topics beyond software architecture. First, it explores several Kotlin language features that help engineers achieve better code quality and software architecture. Next, it discusses the transition from Java to Kotlin with the help of IDE features. The chapter compares two CI approaches: feature-based and trunk-based development. It then covers release strategies, briefly touches on Developer Experience, and concludes with a look at current trends in <span class="No-Break">software architecture.</span></p>
