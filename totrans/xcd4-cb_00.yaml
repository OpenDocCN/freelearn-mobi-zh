    Interfaces – Creating the UI*, introduces the concept of views and how they are
    part of a complete iOS application. Exploring a large number of various view components,
    you will create different applications that will help you understand how each
    component works. We will also learn about the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern
    and how to use it to create applications suitable for enhanced user experience.
    Through this chapter, you will also learn about the most useful controllers, which
    will be part of many of your projects in the future.'

    gains an understanding of what Storyboards are and how we can apply the various
    transitions between views. We will take a look into how we are able to create
    and configure scenes and storyboard files, to present these programmatically.
    Finally, we will learn how to integrate Twitter capabilities into our application
    to tweet photos and standard messages using the new iOS 6 `Social` frameworks.'

    focuses on how to effectively use Instruments within our applications to track
    down memory leaks and eliminate bottlenecks that could potentially cause our application
    to crash on the user''s iOS device. We will also take a look at how to add and
    configure instruments, as well as learn how to use the System Trace Instrument
    to monitor system calls and track down performance issues within the application.'
