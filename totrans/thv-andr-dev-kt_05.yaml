- en: In this second part, you will learn to create an Instagram-like social networking
    app, Packtagram, by setting up its structure, developing user interfaces for stories
    and news feeds, and implementing data retrieval and caching. You will then explore
    integrating CameraX to enhance photo capturing and editing functionalities, including
    using machine learning to generate hashtags. Finally, you will add video capabilities
    to the app, learning to capture, edit with FFmpeg, and upload videos to Cloud
    Storage for Firebase, transforming Packtagram into a comprehensive multimedia
    platform.
