In this chapter, we'll move on from high-level planning to start designing the screens that'll make up our app.</p><p>During the screen designing process, you'll usually complete the following steps:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>First draft wireframing</strong>: This is where you begin to layout your screens by making quick sketches with paper and pencils. A wireframe is a low-fidelity, visual representation of your app's layout; sometimes, it is referred to as a skeleton, outline, page schematic, or screen blueprint. To help you focus on each screen's layout, functionality, and usability, wireframes are usually stripped of all look and feel elements, and at least initially, most content and text.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Digital wireframe</strong>: Once you're happy with your pencil-and-paper wireframes, it's time to refine these first drafts using digital software. This step is also where you check whether your emerging designs are suitable for the kind of content you want to display, by starting to add the content and text that each screen will eventually display.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Prototyping</strong>: The next step is creating a prototype based on your digital wireframe using paper and pencil.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Usability testing</strong>: This is where you test your paper prototypes on an actual user. This type of testing is crucial for highlighting any issues with your navigation and helping you get an idea of how easy your user interface is for users to understand.</li></ul></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note53"/>Note</h3><p>In design, low-fidelity refers to a rough representation of concepts, design alternatives, and screen layouts. By creating low-fidelity prototypes and wireframes, you can test various ideas without having to invest too much time and effort in the design process. The high-fidelity design is where you fill in all the details missing from a design's low-fidelity predecessors. In this chapter, we'll create low-fidelity wireframes using paper and pencils, and then develop these initial ideas into more detailed, high-fidelity digital wireframes.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec41"/>What is wireframing?</h1></div></div></div><p>Think of a wireframe as a skeleton of a screen's layout that describes how major UI components should be arranged in the screen's hierarchy. The purpose of wireframing is to focus on things such as functionality, usability, behavior, and the positioning and priority of your content. Wireframing <em>isn't</em> about graphic design. In fact, at this stage, it's better to leave out all design-related elements. You may even want to make your wireframes look very rough and sketch-like on purpose to help you focus on what each screen <em>does</em> and not what it looks like.</p><p>Your wireframes typically won't include color, unless you're using color to distinguish certain elements of your UI; for example, you might want to grab a colored pencil and draw a box around related content groups, or to add elements that don't have a physical onscreen presence such as interaction and movement.</p><p>You can create wireframes using pencil and paper, by scribbling on a whiteboard or using a wide range of free and commercial software applications. However, for the first drafts, it makes sense to wireframe via quick sketches using a pencil and paper.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec88"/>What are the benefits of wireframing?</h2></div></div></div><p>Wireframing may sound straightforward, but these deceptively simple sketches are an important step in designing more effective application screens. Here are a few of the reasons why it's well worth breaking out your pencil case, grabbing a notebook, and wireframing your app:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Wireframing is ideal for rapidly testing different layouts.<p>Creating sketches is quick and easy, which means wireframing is the perfect opportunity to explore lots of different potential layouts.</p><p>Wireframes encourage you to get creative and experiment with different positioning and sizing of UI elements as well as different navigation. They're also an easy ways of mapping out the relationship between your UI elements.</p><p>By wireframing lots of different possibilities, you can discover the optimal layout for each screen that makes up your app.</p><p>While <em>technically</em> there's nothing stopping you from getting experimental at every stage of the design process, the more time and effort you invest in your project, the less inclined you'll be to experiment with new ideas and alternate layouts.</p><p>One thing you should be aware of while wireframing lots of different layouts is that wireframes are static representations of your screens. Wireframes <em>aren't</em> very good at displaying interactive details or moving elements. You'll need to use your imagination to get a better idea of how any interactive or moving elements work in your layouts, or spend some extra time prototyping and testing your layouts, which is something we'll cover later on in this chapter.</p></li></ul></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">They help you identify problems early in the design process.<p>As with everything in life, sometimes things work better in theory than they do in practice, so what seemed like a good idea on a screen map or in your head may break down as soon as you try and implement it.</p><p>Whether your app goes through multiple extensive design changes or simply a few tweaks, design changes are an inevitable part of creating a mobile app, so isn't it better to discover potential problems as early as possible? Wireframing is one of the quickest and easiest ways of uncovering issues with your designs, and revising a wireframe is approximately 1 billion times easier than revising a high-fidelity mockup or, even worse, a user interface that's already under development.</p><p>Discovering issues at the wireframing stage also means you're more likely to make whatever changes are necessary to properly resolve the issue, even if it means drastically changing your design. When you uncover issues further down the line, you're naturally going to be tempted to look for workarounds and quick fixes that'll patch the issue without causing too much disruption to your design. This approach may make your life easier in the short term, but it probably isn't going to make for very happy end users in the long run.</p></li></ul></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">They encourage you to capture a complete design rather than winging it.<p>Do you feel like you have a crystal-clear picture in your mind's eye of how your app should look? Maybe you've had this vision before you even started the planning process.. If this is the case, then great, but you still need to capture this vision on paper!</p><p>Mental pictures have a tendency to be a bit fuzzy around the edges, and sometimes, you don't even quite realize how fuzzy they are until you try to capture them on paper. Once you start trying to recreate what you see in your mind's eye, you may realize that there are still a few question marks hanging over certain parts of your design.</p><p>And as you move through the design process, it's far easier to redraft and refine something that's physically there in front of you, rather than an image that's floating around in the ether.</p></li></ul></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">They give everyone a common design language.<p>At their core, wireframes are basically just labeled and annotated sketches, so they're something that everyone can understand. This is good news if your app is a team effort, as wireframes help to bridge the gap between <em>developing</em> an app and <em>designing</em> an app <em>without</em> resorting to any developer or designer lingo.</p><p>If you're developing an app for a client, wireframes are also a great way of making sure your client has a clear picture of how their project is progressing. You can then get the client's input and, hopefully, their sign-off on your design before you move onto the next stage of your project.</p><p>People are naturally more reluctant to pick fault with a design that someone's clearly spent hours, perhaps even days, perfecting. Although it's nice to want to spare a team member's feelings, this isn't going to help you create the best possible app in the long run.</p><p>Make sure your wireframe <em>looks</em> like a quick sketch, and even the politest member of your team should feel comfortable pointing out its flaws.</p></li></ul></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">They encourage you to start thinking about navigation in more detail.<p>It's impossible to overestimate the negative impact of poorly-designed navigation. If a user can't navigate through your app with ease, they're going to navigate straight <em>out</em> of your app.</p><p>We touched on navigation in the previous chapter, but up until now, navigation has been nothing more than a set of up, down, and side-to-side arrows on a screen map. Wireframing is the perfect opportunity to start thinking about <em>how</em> you're going to implement your app's navigation. How exactly are your users going to move from the home screen to the Settings screen? Via tabs, action bars? How about their device's <strong>Back</strong> button? Wireframing is an essential step in designing effective navigation. In fact, whenever you create a wireframe, the first thing you'll need to do is decide what navigational elements should appear on the screen, as you'll see later on in this chapter.</p></li></ul></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec89"/>Creating a Wireframe</h2></div></div></div><p>Creating a wireframe may seem fairly straightforward. Anyone can slap a bunch of sketches together, right? While wireframing is supposed to be quick and easy, if you're going to get the maximum value out of your wireframing sessions, then you'll want to put as much thought as possible into your wireframes.</p><p>For the early drafts, the most effective method of wireframing is to simply sketch out your screens using paper and pencils. Ideally, you should produce several versions of each screen, and paper sketches are the quickest way to test out a few ideas. Once you've finished sketching, simply place your sketches side by side and decide which is the most effective design, or you may even decide to combine elements from multiple sketches to create the perfect layout.</p><p>Even if you prefer the thought of digital wireframing and are itching to sit down in front of your computer and boot up your favorite image-editing program, you should still take the time to create rough sketches first, as this is the perfect way to get your ideas flowing, and quickly test out multiple designs before moving onto the more time-consuming process of digital wireframing.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec48"/>Creating your first wireframe</h3></div></div></div><p>During your wireframing sessions, it's helpful to have your screen map handy, so you can keep referring to it. When approaching a new project, it usually makes sense to start with the first screen the user will see when they launch your app. In our recipe app, this just so happens to be the home screen.</p><p>Draw a rough outline of your screen, and then work out what navigational elements you need to include. For our recipe home screen, these are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The screens the user can reach the home screen <em>from</em>. Essentially, you need to consider how the user will navigate back to the previous screen. A lot of the time, this is handled automatically by the device's <strong>Back</strong> button, but you can also provide backward navigation via the left-point caver that appears in the action bar or a UI element, such as a <strong>Return to previous screen</strong> button. To keep things simple, let's assume that the backward navigation is handled automatically by the device's <strong>Back</strong> softkey.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The screens the user can navigate <em>to</em>. In our recipe example, this is the list of saved recipes, the list of categories, and the search screen. To present all these options in a compact way, I'm going to add them to a menu that'll appear along the left-hand side of the screen:</li></ul></div><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05061_6_1.jpg" alt="Creating your first wireframe"/></div><p>
</p><p>Next, decide what content you need to display. Start by adding the most important content such as images, headings, subheadings, and other large blocks of content, and then work your way down the content hierarchy.</p><p>For my home screen, I want to display the app's title and logo, plus a few tantalizing images of the meals that users can cook by following the recipes included in this app:</p><p>

</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip54"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>Feeling uninspired?</strong></p><p>If you're struggling for inspiration, then taking a critical look at other apps is a great way to kickstart the creative process. The best places to draw inspiration from are high-rated apps on the Google Play store or Google's own suite of apps. The latter are particularly useful as they're usually good examples of the latest best practices and design principles, particularly Material Design.</p><p>Spend some time flicking through the different screens and ask yourself what you like about each screen's layout and whether there are any improvements you could make. It may help to create wireframes of any screen you particularly like, and then look for any similarities, elements, or just general design principles that you can use in your own wireframes.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec90"/>Exploring more wireframes</h2></div></div></div><p>Every time you create a wireframe, the process will differ slightly depending on factors such as the kind of app you're creating, the content you want to display, the screen's purpose, and your target audience. However, it is possible to identify certain <em>types</em> of screens that occur across multiple apps as these often share similar characteristics and UI elements.</p><p>Case in point: our home screen wireframe. Many apps have some form of home screen, and these screens often feature things such as headings, logos, and main menus–exactly like our recipe app home screen. In addition to the home screen, this app is a great example of a few other common <em>types</em> of screens. Since you're likely to encounter these screens in your own projects at some point, let's look at how you can approach creating wireframes for each of these screens.</p><p>I'll start with what I'm going to call a <em>details</em> screen. This is a screen that appears when the user selects an item on a previous screen, and the app displays a new screen containing more information about the selected item. In our recipe app, the screen containing each recipe is a details screen; users scroll through a list of recipes, spots one they like the look of, and then tap the recipe. At this point, they're taken to a separate screen containing all the information they need to recreate this meal.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note55"/>Note</h3><p>In our screen map, we have referred to this screen as the <em>detailed recipe view</em>.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec49"/>Wireframing a details screen</h3></div></div></div><p>As the name suggests, details screens are all about displaying information, which is typically a mix of text and media, such as images, videos, or audio.</p><p>Let's follow the same process we used for wireframing our home screen and start by identifying all the navigational elements we need to add. Taking a look at the screen map, I can see that I need to add the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The screens the user can reach the detailed recipe screen <em>from</em>. Since we glossed over backward navigation in our home screen wireframe, let's explore it in more detail here. According to the screen map, the user can reach the detailed recipe screen from the search results screen, the list of recipes for a given category, and the list of saved recipes. Although we could potentially rely on the user tapping their device's <strong>Back</strong> softkey to return to the previous screen, wireframing is all about exploring different options, so I'm going to try something different and add a <strong>Back to previous screen</strong> button to this particular wireframe.</li></ul></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The screens the user can navigate <em>to</em>. In our simple screen map, the detailed recipe screen looks like it's the final screen in the app, but in reality, you rarely encounter this kind of <em>dead end</em> in a mobile application. When users add this recipe to their list of saved recipes, I think it'd be helpful if the app takes users to their online scrapbook, so they can view all their saved recipes. To create this effect, I'm going to add an <strong>Add to scrapbook</strong> button that, when pressed, performs this action <em>and</em> takes the user to their online scrapbook.</li></ul></div><p>Now, it's time for content. In no particular order, I want this screen to display the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The recipe's title</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How difficult the recipe is to make</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An estimate of how long it takes to cook</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An estimate of how much the ingredients cost</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How many people the recipe feeds</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An enticing, mouth-watering photo of the finished result</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The recipe itself</li></ul></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip56"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>Do you really need a details screen?</strong></p><p>The golden rule of creating a details screen is that it <em>must</em> contain enough information to warrant its status as a separate screen. For example, imagine you've just downloaded an app where you can check what films are being shown at your local cinema.</p><p>The first screen is a timetable that displays all the films alongside their showing times. You can tap every film in the timetable and the app will load a new screen that's dedicated to the selected film. What new information might you expect to find on this screen? Maybe a synopsis or a list of the lead actresses and actors? How about a star rating or links to reviews, so you can decide whether this is a film that you <em>need</em> to see on the big screen with popcorn, or whether you should just wait for it to come out on Netflix instead?</p><p>Now, imagine you didn't see any of this additional information, and the details screen simply reiterated the information that you'd already seen on the main screen. Would you feel like this was a well-designed app that was giving you a great user experience? The answer is a resounding <em>nope</em>.</p><p>If you <em>do</em> decide to include a details screen, then make sure it contains some new information. If it doesn't, then it has no value, and therefore, it has no place in your app.</p></div></div><p>As always, add the most important content to your wireframe first. In this example, that's the <strong>Heading</strong>, an image of the finished product, and the <strong>Recipe</strong> itself:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05061_6_3.jpg" alt="Wireframing a details screen"/></div><p>
</p><p>As you work your way down the content hierarchy, you may encounter content that could work in numerous positions in your screen layout. If you do, then this is the ideal time to experiment with different layouts by creating multiple wireframes. You can then place these drawings side by side and decide which layout you prefer, or you can combine elements from multiple wireframes to create your perfect layout. Here's a selection of the wireframes I created for the detailed recipe screen:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05061_6_4.jpg" alt="Wireframing a details screen"/></div><p>
</p><p>This wireframe contains several elements that could conceivably work in different locations–specifically, the text boxes that contain the estimated time, estimated cost, and the number of people this recipe feeds, plus the recipe's star rating. Wireframing gives you a quick and easy way of testing out these elements in several different positions.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05061_6_5.jpg" alt="Wireframing a details screen"/></div><p>
</p><p>While wireframing these elements in various positions, I've decided to keep the major content areas the same in all these wireframes:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05061_6_6.jpg" alt="Wireframing a details screen"/></div><p>
</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note57"/>Note</h3><p>There's lots more content we could add to this screen; for example, it might be nice for users to be able to post comments, upload photos, or award each recipe a rating out of 10. You might also want to include multiple photos of the finished results, so the user can scroll through these photos. To keep this chapter short, I'm not going to wireframe all these options, but if you're feeling creative, you might want to grab a piece of paper and a pencil, and create your own wireframes that include all this additional content.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec50"/>Wireframing search screens</h3></div></div></div><p>Many apps have some form of search functionality, and our recipe app is no exception, so let's take a look at wireframing the search screen.</p><p>You know the drill by now! Look at the screen map and work out all the navigational elements you need to include:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">All the screens the user can reach the search screen <em>from</em>. According to the screen map, users can reach the search screen from the home screen only.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">All the screens the user can navigate <em>to</em>. The only screen the user can reach from the search screen is the search results screen.</li></ul></div><p>In the previous wireframes, we handled backward navigation by relying on the device's <strong>Back</strong> softkey and by creating a <strong>Return to previous screen</strong> button, so let's try something different this time around! I'm going to use a left-facing caret in the action bar.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note58"/>Note</h3><p>When you're creating Android apps in real life, you'll typically select one method of navigation and use it across your app, rather than the mixture we're using in this chapter. Although I'm experimenting with lots of different navigational options, just be aware that in a real-life project, you'd select one form of navigation and apply it across your entire app to avoid confusing and frustrating your users.</p></div></div><p>Let's create our search functionality. I'm going to keep things simple and use the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An <code class="literal">EditText</code> where users can enter the keyword(s) they want to search for.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A button the user presses to submit their search term(s). I'm going to label this button with the standard search system icon  to ensure that the user instantly knows what action this button performs.</li></ul></div><p>You might have noticed that in the previous wireframes, we were talking in general terms, such as heading boxes and images, and now, we're using the technical term <em>EditText.</em> This is because there are no strict rules when it comes to wireframing, so if you already have an idea of how you're going to create certain UI elements, and you want to add this information to your wireframes, then go ahead!</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note59"/>Note</h3><p>The only exception is when you're planning on sharing your wireframes with other people, particularly if these people aren't Android developers themselves! If you're creating wireframes as a collaborative effort with non-Android types, then you should stick to civilian terms such as text boxes and images.</p></div></div><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05061_6_7.jpg" alt="Wireframing search screens"/></div><p>
</p><p>While there's nothing wrong with this layout, there's no denying that it's pretty basic. It would be better if our users could search for recipes based on a few different criteria:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How easy a recipe is to make</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How much the ingredients cost to purchase</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How many people the recipe feeds</li></ul></div><p>There are lots of ways of implementing this functionality, but the two that immediately spring to my mind are here:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Give the user the ability to filter recipes based on different criteria by adding checkboxes to the existing search screen wireframe. Users can then enter any keyword they want to search for <em>and</em> select the relevant checkboxes; for example, they might search for recipes that contain the words <code class="literal">prawn madras</code> (yum, yum) and then select the checkboxes marked <strong>Costs £2-£3</strong> and <strong>Takes 15-20 minutes to cook</strong>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Stick with our simple search screen, but add filters to the search <em>results </em>screen. The user searches for keywords as normal and is taken to the search results screen, which contains additional filters that allow the user to narrow down their search results.</li></ul></div><p>Both of these are viable options, so I've quickly wireframed each approach. This is a great example of how you can use wireframes to quickly test out various layouts:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05061_6_8.jpg" alt="Wireframing search screens"/></div><p>
</p><p>In this wireframe, the user performs a search as usual, but the search results screen contains three new buttons (<strong>Price</strong>,<strong>Time</strong>, and <strong>Feeds...</strong>), which they can use to filter their search results based on different criteria.</p><p>The following wireframe is a new version of the Search screen where users enter their search terms into the <code class="literal">EditText</code> as normal, but then uses various checkboxes to be more specific about the search results they want to see:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05061_6_9.jpg" alt="Wireframing search screens"/></div><p>
</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl4sec15"/>The search screen as a fragment</h4></div></div></div><p>Regardless of where you are in the design and development process, you should always be thinking about how to support as many different Android devices as possible.</p><p>When you're busy wireframing, it's easy to fall into the trap of designing with one device in mind. Although this does make wireframing easier, it won't make for a very effective UI in the long run.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip60"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>Wireframing for landscape and portrait</strong></p><p>Playing around with the sizing and positioning of your content during the wireframing phase not only helps you work out how you might better support multiple screen configurations, but it also helps you to design an app that functions equally well in both landscape and portrait modes.</p></div></div><p>Planning for multiple screens may mean creating several wireframes that target different screen configurations, or it could mean combining your content in different ways using fragments.</p><p>In the previous chapter, we mentioned displaying our search screen as a standalone activity on smaller devices, but displaying it as a fragment alongside the home screen on devices with larger screens. Since we've already wireframed the first possibility, it only seems right to wireframe how the search screen might function as part of a multi-pane layout.</p><p>To speed up this process, I'm going to reuse the home screen wireframe that we created earlier as well as the original, basic search screen wireframe.</p><p>As always, let's start with navigation. Most of the navigational elements from our home screen wireframe are still valid apart from the <strong>Search for recipes</strong> item in the left-hand menu. Since the search box will appear alongside the home screen in this scenario, we can remove this link from the menu.</p><p>Similarly, the original search wireframe included an action bar with a left-facing caret that's no longer necessary; since the fragment appears as part of the home screen, there's nowhere for the user to navigate back <em>to</em> apart from exiting the app, and we don't want to help them do that!</p><p>With navigation sorted, let's look at the content. All the content from the original home screen and search wireframes is still relevant, and therefore, it has a place in our multi-pane layout.</p><p>Let's take a look at the finished result:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05061_6_10.jpg" alt="The search screen as a fragment"/></div><p>
</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note61"/>Note</h3><p>
<strong>Feeling overwhelmed?</strong></p><p>Working out the best position for each element while also trying to design for multiple devices may leave you staring at a blank sheet of paper and wondering <em>where do I start?</em> If you're feeling overwhelmed, then it may help to think of wireframes as a series of drafts.</p><p>When creating you first draft, you should wireframe without stressing about trying to support multiple devices. Instead, concentrate on defining how your app looks in its <em>natural</em> state. How wide would you like that heading to be, if you didn't have to worry about running out of space on smaller handsets? Ideally, how far would that button be placed from the edge of the screen? And do you <em>really</em> want to display two images side by side? Are you sure you wouldn't prefer three? Or four? How about five?</p><p>Grab a pencil and wireframe without a care in the world. Then, after you've finished patting yourself on the back for an excellent first draft, you can start worrying about how this wireframe might translate across different devices.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec91"/>Digital wireframes</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you're satisfied with your paper wireframes, you should develop them further. This may mean creating a more detailed, thought-out sketch using your trusty pencil and paper, or it may mean developing these paper wireframes into <em>digital </em>wireframes.</p><p>If you do decide to digitize your wireframes, there's plenty of wireframing software out there, from professional image-editing programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Fireworks, right through to tools created specifically for wireframing, such as Pidoco, Axure, InDesign, Sketch, Omnigraffle, and Balsamiq Mockups.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B05061_6_11.jpg" alt="Digital wireframes"/></div><p>
</p><p>The previous image is an example of our recipe app home screen, created with the Balsamiq digital wireframing tool.</p><p>If you're unsure about what tool to use, then a quick Google search will return lots of potential wireframing software, at which point you'll be faced with a whole new problem–too much choice!</p><p>If you're struggling to decide between several potential wireframing tools, then ask yourself the following questions:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Does this tool have all the features I need? Before taking the plunge, you should make sure your chosen tool has all the features you need to quickly and easily create wireframes for your <em>specific</em> project. This is especially important if you're investing cold hard cash in professional wireframing software. If you download free wireframing software, and then realize that it isn't quite right for you, then at least you haven't wasted any of your hard-earned cash! To avoid being swayed by persuasive website copy, jot down all the features your ideal wireframing tool should include. You can then check whether each potential tool meets your list of criteria; and if it doesn't, then you can move onto the next one.</li></ul></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Is it customizable? Being able to tweak the wireframing program to meet your exact needs is always positive, but this is particularly important if you're developing an unusual or niche UI.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Can you store reusable elements? You'll typically use many UI elements across multiple screens such as action bars, menu, and buttons. To supercharge the wireframing process, keep an eye out for tools that allow you to easily store and reuse visual elements.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What's the learning curve? Professional vector illustration tools may sound like just the thing your project needs, but complex tools may leave you scratching your head, particularly if you're not overly familiar with design. The whole purpose of wireframing is to save yourself time by quickly testing out multiple layouts. However, this whole exercise becomes pretty pointless if you end up spending hours with your head buried in the program's user manual rather than actually creating wireframes.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Are you already familiar with software that has wireframing potential? Even if this program isn't the most modern or feature rich, if you can use it to create effective wireframes in a reasonable amount of time, then it may make sense to use this old favorite, rather than investing time in getting to grips with some new software.</li></ul></div><p>If you're struggling with the sheer variety of wireframing tools out there, then you may want to focus on free wireframing software, rather than jumping headfirst into purchasing a professional image-editing tool. The huge benefit of free tools is that you can see firsthand whether they're right for you by downloading a few and giving them a quick trial <em>without</em> racking up a massive bill.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec51"/>Adding content to your wireframes</h3></div></div></div><p>Up until now, we've made a point of not adding content to our wireframes; but at some point, you'll need to test whether the way your screens are shaping up is suitable for the kind of content you want to display. Once you have a set of digital wireframes you're happy with, it's time to test whether your content fits into these wireframes, or you need to make some adjustments to said wireframes.</p><p>Content, mainly copy, doesn't really look appealing on <em>any</em> platform, but this is even more true on mobile devices. The smaller screen of a smartphone or tablet can make large blocks of undifferentiated text seem even larger.</p><p>If you're going to present your app's copy in an elegant way, then you need to put some thought into its design, and wireframes are the perfect place to start.</p><p>As you move into digital wireframing territory, you can start experimenting with design elements, such as different fonts, text sizes, bullets and numbered lists, as well as headings and subheadings. The end result? A UI that blends your sparkling, engaging copy with appealing presentation and design–basically, text that your users will actually <em>want</em> to read.</p><p>If you leave content and copy design issues until you have the final screen design in front of you, then chances are that you'll try and convince yourself that it isn't <em>really</em> that big a problem; or you'll look for the quickest and easiest workarounds even if they don't make for the best screen design.</p><p>When adding content to your wireframes, it's crucial to keep in mind what <em>real</em> content looks like. It's tempting to use text that just so happens to be the right size and length to fit neatly into your wireframe. Unfortunately, unless you're <em>very</em> lucky, this simply isn't the way real content works, so it's important to use realistic text in your wireframes.</p><p>Although you can use the classic <code class="literal">Lorem ipsum</code> Latin filler text or some dummy content, the best way to test that your layout is suitable for the kind of content you want to display is to use the same copy that'll eventually appear on the screen.</p><p>In the case of our recipe app, this presents a bit of a problem as the text on each detailed recipe screen will be different. For example, each recipe title will be a different length, so how do we ensure all these titles will fit into the available space?</p><p>The answer is to look at the full range of titles that are ultimately going to have to fit into the heading box, and then work out the average length. You should also go out of your way to find awkward content, as this'll help you plan how your UI will support these edge cases. In this instance, this means finding the longest and shortest recipe titles, and then working out how to display them effectively.</p><p>When the detailed recipe screen has to display a short title, will the size of the heading box remain fixed or will it shrink? And if it does shrink, how can we prevent lots of empty whitespace appearing around the newly shrunken box? Will the box expand to accommodate recipes with unusually long-winded titles? Will the text wrap onto multiple lines?</p><p>You don't have to wireframe <em>every</em> possibility, but you should try to identify all the major problems varying copy and content could cause your layout. Only then will you be able to create a wireframe that's flexible enough to take unusual copy and content in its stride.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec42"/>What is paper prototyping?</h1></div></div></div><p>Once you've created a digital wireframe that you're relatively happy with, it's a good idea to put this design to the test via paper prototyping.</p><p>Paper prototyping is where you create rough drawings of the different screens that make up your app, representing each screen as a separate sheet of paper. You then test this paper prototype on a user (or ideally, <em>users</em>) and incorporate the user's feedback into your digital wireframes. This method of usability testing may seem simple, but it's actually a valuable way of reviewing and refining your design so it's the best it can possibly be.</p><p>Creating a paper prototype is an important step in the design process for two main reasons:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>They're great for identifying any usability problems that you might have overlooked</strong>: Spotting the faults in your own design isn't always easy. Paper prototyping gives you a way of testing your app on your target audience without you having to write any code. And as we've already discussed, the earlier you can identify flaws in your design, the easier it is to fix those flaws.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>They help you test your app's navigation up-front</strong>: Designing easy and frictionless navigation is an essential part of creating a successful app, but it's difficult to properly evaluate navigation until you have actually experienced that navigation. Prototypes are a way of taking your planned navigation for a test drive and seeing first-hand how easy or difficult it is for users to navigate your app. If you skip the paper prototyping stage, the danger is that you won't realize there's a problem with your navigation until you've actually started to build your app. And since navigation should be consistent across your app, if you realize that you need to tweak the navigation on one screen, you may find that you need to change the navigation across <em>all</em> your screens; and this is not something you want to discover at the last minute! Paper prototyping increases your chances of getting navigation right the first time around.</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec92"/>Usability testing</h2></div></div></div><p>Paper prototypes are perfect for usability testing. Ideally, you'll want to test your prototypes on a member of your target audience, but colleagues, friends, and family members make good stand-ins as long as they haven't been involved in the design process.</p><p>For the most effective usability testing, you'll want someone's genuine reaction to approaching your app <em>blind</em>, just as a regular user would after downloading your app from the Google Play store. If you enlist the help of someone who has insider knowledge of your project, then this isn't really replicating the typical user experience.</p><p>In usability testing, your test subject interacts with the paper prototype while you manipulate the prototype to reflect the user's actions. For example, if they tap a <strong>Go to home screen</strong> button, you should switch pages and present them with your home screen prototype. Okay, so this may sound a bit silly, but it's also one of the most effective ways of discovering potential usability issues before you invest any more time in designing and developing your app, so it's well worth feeling a bit silly for.</p><p>Ask the user for feedback as they're interacting with your paper prototype, and be sure to prompt them to explain why they're performing each action and what they expect to happen next. You should also encourage them to speak up about anything that confuses them, or if there's anything about your UI that they don't like. Do they understand how to navigate to the next screen? Do they immediately understand what task they need to perform on each new screen, or do they need to stop and think about it?</p><p>Ideally, you'll get enough information to warrant making some revisions to your digital wireframes. If you do make any significant changes to your wireframes, then consider creating a new set of paper prototypes and testing them on the same user. Repeat this process until your test subjects are navigating your paper prototypes with ease and have no further feedback or suggestions.</p><p>At this stage, you should have a set of digital wireframes that you feel confident about. We'll be using these wireframes to create more detailed, digital prototypes in the next chapter.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec52"/>Rapid prototyping</h3></div></div></div><p>If your app is a team effort, you may want to consider using paper prototyping as part of a rapid prototyping approach.</p><p>In rapid prototyping, each team member creates a paper prototype and tests it on a single user. The team then comes together to share their feedback and ideas, at which point each person creates a second prototype. Again, each prototype is tested on a single user before the team meets again to share their feedback. You can then update your digital wireframes based on the collective feedback. This is one of the quickest and easiest ways of collecting feedback from multiple users and incorporating all this valuable information into your design.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec43"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>When it comes to developing Android apps, it's impossible to overestimate the value of planning.</p><p>In this chapter, we looked at how to translate the high-level plans that we made in the previous chapter into actual screen designs. We created quick paper wireframes, and then used them as the basis for detailed digital wireframes complete with content and copy. Finally, we created paper prototypes and looked at how usability testing can help you refine your screen designs, making them the best they can possibly be. In the next chapter, we'll look at how to create more complex and polished digital prototypes using Android Studio and the Android SDK.</p><p>If this chapter was your first taste of wireframing and prototyping, then you may still be feeling overwhelmed, but the important thing to remember is that as long as you're doing <em>some </em>form of wireframing and prototyping, then you're already doing much more planning than you were before.</p><p>The only word of warning is don't invest too much time and effort perfecting your screen designs early on in the design process. Your designs should start off very rough around the edges and gradually become more refined and detailed as you move through the different planning stages.</p><p>If you're still unsure, then take another look at the recipe wireframes included in this chapter and ask yourself "how could I improve these designs?" Then, wireframe the results! You may even want to create prototypes based on these wireframes. Alternatively, boot up one of your favourite Android apps and create wireframe and prototype versions of all the main screens. These are both valuable ways of refining your skills so that by the time you come to plan your own real-life Android projects, you'll be a wireframing and prototyping pro.</p><p>Now that we've got a rough design for our application, it's time to dive into some development work. In the next chapter, you'll use Android Studio to create a working digital prototype based on your wireframes and paper prototypes.</p></div></body></html>
