		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Chapter 1</em>: Getting Familiar with Xcode</h1>
			<p>Welcome to <a id="_idTextAnchor017"/><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/><em class="italic">iOS 15 Programming for Beginners</em>. I hope you will find this a useful introduction to creating and publishing iOS 15 apps on the App Store.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you'll learn how to download and<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> install <strong class="bold">Xcode</strong> on your Mac. You'll familiarize yourself with the different parts of the Xcode user interface, and you'll create your first <strong class="bold">iOS app</strong> and run it in the <strong class="bold">iOS simulator</strong>. You will then learn how to connect an <strong class="bold">iOS device</strong> to Xcode via USB so that you can run the app on it, how to add an <strong class="bold">Apple ID</strong> to Xcode so the necessary digital certificates can be created and installed on your device, and how to trust the certificate on your device. Finally, you will learn how to connect to your device over Wi-Fi, so you no longer need to plug and unplug your device every time you want to run an app.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will know how to create and run apps on the iOS simulator or an iOS device, which you will need to do when you build your own apps.</p>
			<p>The following topics will be covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Downloading and installing Xcode from the App Store</li>
				<li>Understanding the Xcode user interface</li>
				<li>Running the app in the iOS simulator</li>
				<li>Using an iOS device for development</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To do the exercises for this chapter, you will need the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An Apple Mac computer running macOS 11 Big Sur or macOS 12 Monterey</li>
				<li>An Apple ID (if you don't have one, you will create one in this chapter) </li>
				<li>Optionally, an iOS device running iOS 15</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>Xcode project for this chapter is in the <code>Chapter01</code> folder of the code bundle for this book, which can be downloaded here:</p>

			<p>You'll start by downloading Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) for developing iOS apps from the App Store, in the next section.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">The size of the download is very large (11.7 GB at the time of writing) so it may take a while to download. Ensure that you have enough disk space prior to downloading.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Downloading and installing Xcode from the App Store</h1>
			<p>Before you begin<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> writing iOS apps, you need to download and install <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>Xcode from the App Store. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">App Store</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Apple</strong> menu.</li>
				<li>In the search field in the top-right corner, type <code>Xcode</code> and press the <em class="italic">Return</em> key.</li>
				<li>You should see <strong class="bold">Xcode</strong> in the search results. Click <strong class="bold">Get</strong> and click <strong class="bold">Install</strong>.</li>
				<li>If you have an Apple ID, type it in the <strong class="bold">Apple ID</strong> text box. If you don't have one, click the <strong class="bold">Create Apple ID</strong> button and follow the step-by-step instructions to create one:<div><img src="img/Figure_1.01_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1: Apple ID creation dialog box&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.1: Apple ID creation dialog box</p><p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p><p class="callout">You can see more information on how to create an Apple ID using this link: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204316#appstore">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204316#appstore</a>.</p></li>
				<li>Once <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>Xcode has been installed, launch it. You <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>should see the following <strong class="bold">Welcome to Xcode</strong> screen. Click <strong class="bold">Create a new Xcode project</strong> in the left-hand pane:<div><img src="img/Figure_1.02_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2: Welcome to Xcode screen&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.2: Welcome to Xcode screen</p></li>
				<li>You will <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>see the new project screen as follows. In the <strong class="bold">Choose a template for your new project:</strong> section, select <strong class="bold">iOS</strong>. Then choose <strong class="bold">App</strong> and click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_1.03_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3: Choose a template for your new project screen&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.3: Choose a template for your new project screen</p></li>
				<li>You will <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>see the <code>ExploringXcode</code> in the text field.</li><li><code>com.yourname</code> for now. This is known as reverse domain name notation format, and is normally used here.</li><li><strong class="bold">Interface</strong>: The method used to create the user interface for your app. Set this to <strong class="bold">Storyboard</strong>.</li><li><strong class="bold">Language</strong>: The programming language to be used. Set this to <strong class="bold">Swift</strong>.<p>Leave the other settings as their default values and make sure all the checkboxes are unticked. Click <strong class="bold">Next</strong> when done.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>You'll see a <strong class="bold">Save</strong> dialog box. Choose a location to save your project, such as the <strong class="bold">Desktop</strong> or <strong class="bold">Documents</strong> folder, and click <strong class="bold">Create</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_1.05_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 1.5: Save dialog box&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.5: Save dialog box</p></li>
				<li>If you<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> see a dialog box saying <strong class="bold">No author information was supplied by the version control system</strong>, click <strong class="bold">Fix</strong>.<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p><p class="callout">The reason why you see this dialog box is because the <strong class="bold">Source Control</strong> checkbox is ticked. Apple recommends that Source Control be turned on.

				<li><strong class="bold">Author Name:</strong> – Your own name</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Author Email:</strong> – Your email address</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Close the <strong class="bold">Source Control</strong> preference screen by clicking the red Close button in the top-left corner when done. The<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> Xcode main window will appear.</p>
			<p>Fantastic! You have now successfully downloaded and installed Xcode and created your first project. In the next section, you will learn about the Xcode user interface.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Understanding the Xcode user interface</h1>
			<p>You've just<a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> created your first Xcode project! As you can see, the Xcode user interface is divided into several distinct parts, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.07_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 1.7: Xcode user interface&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.7: Xcode user interface</p>
			<p>Let's look at<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> each part in more detail. The following descriptions correspond to the numbers shown in the preceding screenshot:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Toolbar (1)</strong> – Used to build and run your apps, and view the progress of running tasks.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Navigator area (2)</strong> – Provides quick access to the various parts of your project. The <strong class="bold">Project navigator</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>displayed by default.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Editor area (3) </strong>– Allows you to edit source code, user interfaces, and other resources.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inspector area (4)</strong> – Allows you to view and edit information about items selected in the Navigator area or Editor area.  </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Debug area (5)</strong> – Contains <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>the <strong class="bold">debug bar</strong>, the <strong class="bold">variables view</strong>, and<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> the <strong class="bold">Console</strong>. The<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> Debug area is toggled by typing <em class="italic">Shift + Command + Y</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, let's examine the toolbar more closely. The left side of the toolbar is shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.08_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 1.8: Xcode toolbar (left side)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.8: Xcode toolbar (left side)</p>
			<p>Let's look at each part in more detail. The following description corresponds to the numbers shown in <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>the preceding screenshot:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Navigator button (1)</strong> – Toggles <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>the Navigator area on and off.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stop button (2)</strong> – Only appears next to the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button when the app is running. Stops the currently running app.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Play button (3)</strong> – Used to build and run your app.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scheme menu (4)</strong> – Shows the specific scheme to build your project (<strong class="bold">Exploring Xcode</strong>) and the destination to run your app on (<strong class="bold">iPhone SE (2nd generation</strong>). <p>Schemes and destinations are distinct. Schemes specify the settings for building and running your project. Destinations specify installation locations for your app, and exist for physical devices and simulators.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Activity View (5)</strong> - Displays the progress of running tasks.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The right side of the toolbar is shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.09_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 1.9: Xcode toolbar (right side)&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.9: Xcode toolbar (right side)</p>
			<p>Let's look at each part in more detail. The following description corresponds to the numbers shown in the preceding screenshot:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Library button (1)</strong> – Displays user interface elements, code snippets, and other resources.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inspector button (2)</strong> – Toggles the Inspector area on and off.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Don't be overwhelmed by all the different parts, as you'll learn about them in more detail in later chapters. Now that you are familiar with the Xcode interface, you will run the app you just created in the iOS simulator, which displays a representation of your iOS device.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Running the app in the iOS simulator</h1>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> iOS simulator is installed when you install Xcode. It provides a simulated iOS device so that you can see what your app looks like and how it behaves, without needing a physical iOS device. It can model all the screen sizes and resolutions for both iPad and iPhone so you can test your app on multiple devices easily.</p>
			<p>To run your app in<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> the simulator, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click the <strong class="bold">Scheme</strong> menu in the toolbar and you will see a list of simulators. Choose <strong class="bold">iPhone SE (2nd</strong><strong class="bold"> generation)</strong> from this menu:<div><img src="img/Figure_1.10_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 1.10: Xcode Scheme menu with iPhone SE (2nd generation) selected&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.10: Xcode Scheme menu with iPhone SE (2nd generation) selected</p></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> to install and run your app on <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>the currently selected simulator. You can also use the <em class="italic">Command + R</em> keyboard shortcut.</li>
				<li>If you see the <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> of the Mac's administrator account, and click <strong class="bold">Continue.</strong></li>
				<li>The simulator will launch and show a representation of an iPhone SE (2nd generation). Your<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> app displays a white screen, as you have not yet added anything to your project:<div><img src="img/Figure_1.11_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 1.11: iOS Simulator&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.11: iOS Simulator</p></li>
				<li>Switch <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>back to Xcode and click on the <strong class="bold">Stop</strong> button (or press <em class="italic">Command</em> + <em class="italic">.</em>) to stop the currently running project.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You have just created and run your first iOS app in the simulator! Great job!</p>
			<p>If you look at the <strong class="bold">Scheme</strong> menu, you may wonder what the <strong class="bold">No Devices</strong> and <strong class="bold">Build</strong> sections <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>are for. Let's a look at them in the next <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>section.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">If you are using an M1 Mac you will see <strong class="bold">My Mac (Designed for iPad)</strong> instead of <strong class="bold">No Devices</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Scheme</strong> menu.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Understanding the No Devices and Build sections</h2>
			<p>You<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> learned how to choose a simulator in the <strong class="bold">Scheme</strong> menu to run your app in the previous section. In addition to the list of simulators, the <strong class="bold">Scheme</strong> menu also has <strong class="bold">No Devices</strong> and <strong class="bold">Build</strong> sections. These allow you to run apps on actual iOS devices, and prepare apps for submission to the App Store.</p>
			<p>Click the <strong class="bold">Scheme</strong> menu in the toolbar to <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>see the <strong class="bold">No Devices</strong> and <strong class="bold">Build </strong>sections at the top of the menu:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_1.12_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 1.12: Xcode Scheme menu with Any iOS Device (arm64) selected&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.12: Xcode Scheme menu with Any iOS Device (arm64) selected</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">No Devices</strong> section currently displays text stating <strong class="bold">No devices connected to 'My Mac'... </strong>, because you currently don't have any iOS devices connected to your computer. If you were to plug in an iOS device, it would appear in this section, and you would be able <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>to run the apps you develop on it for testing. Running your apps on an actual device is recommended as the simulator will not accurately reflect the performance characteristics of an actual iOS device, and does not have some hardware<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> features and software APIs that actual devices have.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Build</strong> section has only one menu item, <strong class="bold">Any iOS Device (arm64)</strong>. This is used when you need to archive your app prior to submitting it to the App Store. You'll learn how to do this in <a href="B17469_26_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor496"><em class="italic">Chapter 26</em></a><em class="italic">, Testing and Submitting Your App to the App Store.</em> </p>
			<p>Now let's see how to build and run your app on an actual iOS device. The vast majority of the instructions in this book do not require you to have an iOS device though, so if you don't have one, skip the next section and go straight to <a href="B17469_02_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Simple Values and Types</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Using an iOS device for development</h1>
			<p>Although you'll be <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>able to go through most of the exercises in this book using the simulator, it is recommended to build and test your apps on an actual iOS device, as the simulator will not be able to simulate some hardware components and software APIs.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">For a comprehensive look at all the differences between the Simulator and an actual device, see this link: <a href="https://help.apple.com/simulator/mac/current/#/devb0244142d">https://help.apple.com/simulator/mac/current/#/devb0244142d</a>.</p>
			<p>In addition to your device, you'll need an Apple ID or a paid Apple Developer account to build and run your app on your device. You'll use the same Apple ID that you used to download Xcode from the App Store for now. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Use the cable that came with your iOS device to connect your device to your Mac, and make sure the iOS device is unlocked.<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">You can view connected devices by choosing <strong class="bold">Window </strong>|<strong class="bold"> Devices and Simulators</strong> in the Xcode menu bar.</p></li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Scheme</strong> menu, choose<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> your device (<strong class="bold">iPhone</strong> in this case) as the run destination:<div><img src="img/Figure_1.13_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 1.13: Xcode Scheme menu with actual iOS device selected&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.13: Xcode Scheme menu with actual iOS device selected</p></li>
				<li>Wait for Xcode to finish indexing and processing, which will take a while. Once complete, <strong class="bold">Ready</strong> will be displayed in the status window.</li>
				<li>Run the project by clicking the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button (or use <em class="italic">Command + R</em>).

			</ol>
			<p>Congratulations! Note that you have to connect your iOS device to your Mac using the cable to build and run your app. You'll learn how to connect to your device over Wi-Fi in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Connecting an iOS device wirelessly</h2>
			<p>Unplugging <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>and replugging your iOS device to your Mac gets pretty cumbersome after a while, so you'll configure Xcode to connect to your iOS device over Wi-Fi now. Follow these steps:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned how to download and install Xcode on your Mac. You familiarized yourself with the different parts of the Xcode user interface. You created your first iOS app, selected a simulator, and built and ran the app. You learned what the <strong class="bold">No Device</strong> and <strong class="bold">Generic iOS Device</strong> menu items are for. This enables you to create and run iOS apps on your Mac without requiring an iOS device.</p>
			<p>You learned how to connect an iOS device to Xcode via USB so that you can run the app on it. You added an Apple ID to Xcode so the necessary digital certificates can be created and installed on your device, and trusted the certificate on your device. This gives you the ability to run your apps on an actual device, so you can more accurately determine their performance, and make use of features not available in the iOS simulator.</p>
			<p>Finally, you learned how to connect to your device over Wi-Fi, so you no longer need to plug and unplug your device every time you want to run an app. This makes it much more convenient to build and test your apps on an iOS device as any new builds can be transferred immediately over the air.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you'll start exploring the Swift language using Swift Playgrounds, and learn how simple values and types are implemented in Swift.</p>
