- en: This chapter will cover the basics of how UIKit Dynamics manages your application's
    behaviors. We will cover specific behaviors, such as gravity, bounce, and other
    physics properties. Additionally, we will learn how to create physical boundaries
    so that our views have something to collide with. Without these boundaries, our
    views would continue moving forever without stopping. We will cover how our views
    will interact with one another, including collision detection/notifications and
    attaching views to one another. Lastly, we will talk about motion effects and
    about creating a parallax effect similar to iOS 7's home screen that moves when
    tilting your device. We have a lot to cover, so let's get started!

    that has been used since the introduction of the iPhone and iOS. In its place
    is a new and refreshing flat design that features muted gradients and minimal
    interface elements. Apple has strongly encouraged developers to move away from
    a skeuomorphic and real-world-based design in favor of these flat designs.

    that your user interface have a real-world *feel*. Some may think this is a contradiction;
    however, the goal is to give users a deeper connection to the user interface.
    UI elements that respond to touch, gestures, and changes in orientation are examples
    of how to apply this new design paradigm. In order to help assist in this new
    design approach, Apple has introduced two very nifty APIs, UIKit Dynamics and
    Motion Effects.

    You can manipulate specific properties to provide a more real-world feel to your
    interface. This includes gravity, springs, elasticity, bounce, and force to name
    a few. Each interface item will contain its own properties and the dynamic engine
    will abide by these properties.

    on the home screen. Tilting the device in any direction will pan the background
    image to emphasize depth. Using motion effects, we can monitor the data supplied
    by the device's accelerometer to adjust our interface based on movement and orientation.

    a realistic feel that brings it to life. To demonstrate UIKit Dynamics, we will

    animator is the physics engine itself wrapped in a convenient and easy-to-use

    assigned to it. Each behavior will interact inside of this physics engine.

    all define individual responses to the physics environment. This particular behavior
    mimics the effects of gravity by applying force. Each behavior is associated with
    a view (or views) when created. Because you explicitly define this property, you
    can control which views will perform the behavior.

    been assigned behaviors. Each behavior can be assigned to multiple objects, and
    each object can have multiple behaviors. Because our labels have no behaviors
    associated with them, the UIKit Dynamics physics engine simply ignores it.

    the date label but continues to fall, pushing the date label with it.

    fall immediately. Although it does not respond to gravity, the label will still
    be moved because it is a physics object after all. This approach is not ideal,

    items are. Rather than referencing dynamics as views, they are referenced as items,
    which adhere to the `UIDynamicItem` protocol. This protocol defines the center,
    transform, and bounds of any object that adheres to this protocol. `UIView` is
    the most common class that adheres to the `UIDynamicItem` protocol. Another example
    of a class that conforms to this protocol is the `UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes`

    create a new square view and then attach it to our food image view, but only when
    a collision occurs. Because our food image view will bounce a couple of times,
    the collision will be detected each time. To keep from creating multiple squares,

    and you will see that on the first bounce, a green square is created. Because
    we attach this new view to the food image view, you will see that as it bounces
    the second and third times, the square view moves with it as if attached.

    UIKit Dynamics provides a built-in behavior that will snap an item from its starting
    point to a specified end point with built-in damping. Let's have our food image
    view snap from the top of the screen into its final position.

    position of the image view. We set the damping value to be a bit higher to give
    a milder spring effect (the lower the number, the more springy the item will be).

    Switch to **Main.storyboard** and drag the food image view to the top of the screen
    as high as you wish (even offscreen). It is important to note that the greater
    the distance of the starting point to the end point, the more springy the snap,
    so take this into consideration when setting the `damping` property.
