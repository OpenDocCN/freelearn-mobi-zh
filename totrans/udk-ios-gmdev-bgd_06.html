I would keep placing static meshes to hide areas of geometry that I missed, or adding in blocking volumes in order to make it actually possible to go through some places. One of the key reasons I had problems was that I didn't realize how to create a good workflow, and the key to mapping things in CSG super easily is<strong> Geometry Mode</strong>. Before we take care of that, let's first get our current level ready.<a class="indexterm" id="id345"/>
</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec02"/>Time for action—starting our level</h1></div></div></div><p>We are now building our level from scratch using the pieces that we have built in previous chapters. As we already have a basis to draw from let's start our game off. We can start our level as follows:<a class="indexterm" id="id346"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In the Editor, select our<strong> PlayerStart</strong> actor. Move it to the left-hand side of the first door in our level by using Translation Mode.</li><li class="listitem">Move the spawn point for our first enemy to be in front of the door using<strong> Translation Mode</strong>. There is a small light blue colored arrow on the actor. The arrow represents the direction in which the actor is facing. With that in mind, rotate the enemy's position in Rotation mode so it is facing away from the hero.</li><li class="listitem">Move the<strong> PathNode</strong> such that the second enemy is spawned right in front of the door through which it comes (the second door to the right).</li><li class="listitem">Left-click on your current floor of the level and move it down by 32 units, using the grid snap by pressing the<em> [</em> and<em> ]</em> keys will decrease and increase the grid snap points until you get there.</li><li class="listitem">Change the<strong> World Properties</strong> by selecting<strong> View</strong> |<strong> World Properties</strong> and set the<strong> Kill Z</strong> to<strong> -64</strong> so we won't die when we hit the floor.</li><li class="listitem">Create three walls to encase our hero at his starting point as well as a ceiling above him and floor below him all with a width of<strong> 32</strong>. Create the first wall, then by holding<em> Alt</em> and dragging the wall in the top viewport, duplicate the original wall to the other side.</li><li class="listitem">In front of our door make a duplicate of our floor by moving it 64 units in front, along the axis. Go into<strong> Geometry</strong> mode and hold the<em> Ctrl</em> +<em> Alt</em> keys and drag until you select both the vertices on the left-hand side in the top viewport. Drag the floor until it faces the door. Select the two vertices at the top and drag it down until it is in front of the door, and do the same for the bottom. At this point you should have a box in front of your door.</li><li class="listitem">Right-click on the side viewport and select<strong> Viewport Type</strong> |<strong> Front</strong> to place the view into the front mode. Our screen should look like the following screenshot by now.<div><img alt="Time for action—starting our level" height="156" src="img/image_1901_06_01.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">At that point in<strong> Geometry</strong> mode select our box and only click on the top right vertex. From there use the translation tool to move it to the left by 64 degrees coming to the same point as the other vertices at the top, as shown in the following image:<a class="indexterm" id="id347"/><div><img alt="Time for action—starting our level" src="img/image_1901_06_02.jpg" width="243"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Build the map by selecting<strong> Build</strong> |<strong> Build All</strong>. You should see a ramp going into your room that we created.<a class="indexterm" id="id348"/></li><li class="listitem">Return the viewport back to its previous position by right-clicking and selecting<strong> Viewport Type</strong> |<strong> Side</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Press<em> L</em> in the center of the room to create a light. Selecting the light, put it in the direct center of the room in the X, Y, and Z axes. Open the<strong> PointLight actor</strong> properties, change its radius to<code class="literal"> 512</code>, and its<strong> Falloff Exponent</strong> to<code class="literal"> 16</code>. Inside the<strong> Light Component</strong> set the light color to a light blue and change the brightness to<code class="literal"> 0.6</code>. Press<em> Alt</em> +<em> 3</em> to go into Unlit mode until you are ready to see the game's lighting, but you will have to build every time you change something to see it correctly.<a class="indexterm" id="id349"/><p>Having a good reference can be key when creating new areas or gameplay. Characters in Unreal are defaulted to 96 units tall and while we can create a box of that size or right-click to get the measuring tape out to adjust, we can just place a mesh in our level to give us an idea of human proportions. Note that this is the character size of Epic Games' characters, but UDK does not limit the size of your characters. If you wish to create your own custom characters you may do so, but it is important that no matter what you remain consistent.
</p></li><li class="listitem">Go into the<strong> Content Browser</strong> and scroll your<strong> Packages</strong> column until you can click on<strong> UDK Game</strong>. With that selected type<code class="literal"> Iron</code> in the search bar while checking the<strong> Skeletal Mesh</strong> option in the<strong> Object Type</strong> field. Left-click on the<strong> IronGuard Skeletal Mesh</strong>. Right-click in our level and place the object on top of the ground in our level. Note that you may have to move the mesh and adjust your grid spacing to get it just right. The following screenshot shows this process.<div><img alt="Time for action—starting our level" src="img/image_1901_06_03.jpg" width="227"/></div><p>Having a reference is a great thing, especially if you are trying to recreate a real life building, however note that often at times in games you will have to compensate for different aspects of the world due to the differences in both gameplay and camera work. For example, hallways in games are usually two to three times larger than they would really be especially in games that can be multiplayer, such as <em>Left 4 Dead</em>.
<a class="indexterm" id="id350"/>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Left-click on our new actor and open up its properties by clicking<em> F4</em>. Type<code class="literal"> Hidden</code> in the search bar and check the<strong> Hidden Game</strong> property.<a class="indexterm" id="id351"/><p>Since we are in the games ourselves we don't need to see our reference, however if you'd like to keep our new actor in until you're ready then by all means go for it.
</p></li><li class="listitem">Select the walls inside of our room by left-clicking on them in the perspective viewport.</li><li class="listitem">Select the other walls in the room, taking care to remember that the door has two parts and a top. You can do this by holding<em> Ctrl</em> and clicking on each of the elements or right-clicking and selecting<strong> Select Adjacent Walls</strong>, but this option may also select the walls outside of the building as well. Also select the inside of the door, pressing<em> Alt</em> +<em> W</em> to hide static meshes to select them, remembering to press<em> Alt</em> +<em> W</em> again when finished.<a class="indexterm" id="id352"/></li><li class="listitem">Go to the<strong> Content Browser</strong> and pick out a wall material to use. I personally used<code class="literal"> M_LT_Walls_BSP_Recycle06b</code> which is located in the<strong> LT_Walls</strong> package. Once you have left-clicked on the material you wanted to use, right-click on a selected wall in the perspective viewport and select<strong> Add Material : M_LT_Walls_BSP_Recycle06b</strong>. The following image shows the material that has been added to the walls:<div><img alt="Time for action—starting our level" src="img/image_1901_06_04.jpg" width="227"/></div><p>Now you may notice that the material may look a bit off in terms of placement and how it doesn't match up; that's okay because that is what we're going to fix next.
</p></li><li class="listitem">Press<em> F5</em> to enter the<strong> Surface</strong> properties menu. The first and easiest step is to change our alignment so that the brushes will work together so we have a seamless transition between brushes. To do this, find the<strong> Alignment</strong> property, click on the<strong> Box</strong> selection and click on<strong> Apply</strong>. Since our object is in fact shaped similarly to a box, it makes sense that the material can be applied this way, as shown in the following screenshot:<a class="indexterm" id="id353"/><div><img alt="Time for action—starting our level" src="img/image_1901_06_05.jpg" width="76"/></div><p>However, I think that the texture is too small for the room I created; this is a simple fix as well. Above the <strong>Alignment</strong> box there is another area of the properties called <strong>Scaling</strong>. Under the <strong>Simple</strong> Option select <code class="literal">2.0</code> and click on the <strong>Apply</strong> button. Now our texture is twice as big as it was before. The <strong>Scaling</strong> box is shown in the following screenshot:
<a class="indexterm" id="id354"/>
</p><div><img alt="Time for action—starting our level" height="58" src="img/image_1901_06_06.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now, we're on the right track, but I want to move the image down and over until I get to just the right place I want the texture to be. Panning the material will do just that. Adjust the<strong> U</strong> and<strong> V</strong> position of the texture by clicking on the buttons until you get the position you want for the material. I personally took the silvery part and made it a baseboard of sorts for my room. This is shown in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="Time for action—starting our level" height="63" src="img/image_1901_06_07.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Choose a ceiling and floor material for your room.

Go to<strong> Geometry</strong> mode and right-click on the top right vertices to change the position of our translate tool. Hold<em> Alt</em> and drag the item to the right-hand side so that it would be where the previous door would have been. Right-click and select<strong> Transform</strong> |<strong> Mirror Y Axis</strong> and move the room until it creates a room in front of the one that we previously created. Delete any extra<strong> PathNodes</strong> or<strong> PlayerStart</strong> actors you may have created.</li><li class="listitem">Build our game by selecting<strong> Build</strong> |<strong> Build All</strong> and click on<strong> Close</strong> when finished.</li><li class="listitem">Save your project and start your game by clicking on the<strong> Start Mobile Previewer</strong> button on the main toolbar, saying<strong> yes</strong> when it asks you to save the package.

Taking this into consideration we will be able to create a larger environment and complete our sample level.<a class="indexterm" id="id356"/>
</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec03"/>Geometry mode</h1></div></div></div><p>We talked about building a simple room earlier in the book, and when we created our doorway in <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Using Kismet and Matinee">Chapter 4</a>,<em> Using Kismet and Matinee</em>, we began to explore<strong> Geometry Mode</strong> and how we can use it. In much the same way we can use it to create gameplay areas quickly and effectively.<a class="indexterm" id="id357"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec02"/>Setting up the workflow</h2></div></div></div><p>You may have noticed a grid of sorts in all the viewports other than the perspective one. We will be using the grid as a guideline in the creation of our levels in much the same way that you could use paper to draw things out, which is something some level designers I know do to get the general feel of an area. In order to build a general area you need to have this planned ahead of time—things such as having a general idea of how you want to place buildings, as well as an idea of how you want to guide the traversal of the player.<a class="indexterm" id="id358"/>
</p><p>As mentioned before, pressing the<em> [</em> and<em> ]</em> keys in the editor will decrease and increase the grid snap points making the level more or less detailed in your brush placement. For the purposes of this book, unless I say differently, I have my grid spacing set to 32. Some people will want to use a smaller area, but I argue that when blocking something out we really only care about the big picture and getting the overall feel of the area. In case your brush is not aligned to the grid you can right-click on the vertices, and it will automatically snap it to the grid. If you notice the brush changing to have an<strong> X</strong> on it, which is alright, but it is advisable to go to the<strong> Brush Properties</strong> and reapply collision to it. This can be extremely useful, especially when working on the things discussed in previous chapters to get it to fit in line with the grid you are now using. Working with the grid is a fundamental way of making sure that you are not getting any holes and/or overlays of your brushes when creating a level. This is another way to make sure that your subtractive brushes will work as you intend them to; however I never use subtractive brushes if I can at all help it.<a class="indexterm" id="id359"/>
</p><p>One thing to note when using<strong> Geometry</strong> mode: you will not see any changes that we make when editing in<strong> Geometry</strong> mode until we build our BSP brushes again.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"/>Tip</h3><p>In all of the Unreal Tournament games (and<strong> UTDeathmatch</strong> games like we're using), 1 Unreal Unit is equal to 2 centimeters. That means that the 96 Unit character is in fact 6 feet tall! That being said, building things to scale can often seem much smaller than they really are because of the players field of view(FOV)" but it's a nice thing to use as a basis when building from real life.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec03"/>Some keyboard tips</h2></div></div></div><p>Holding<em> Ctrl</em> +<em> Alt</em> at the same time and dragging will allow you to select all objects that are contained within it. If you are in<strong> Geometry</strong> mode it will allow you to select individual/overlapping vertices, allowing you to increase or decrease the size of your brushes very easily, which we will be using to create our buildings in the next section.<a class="indexterm" id="id360"/>
</p><p>Another useful tip is if you hold<em> Ctrl</em> and drag the left mouse button anywhere in a viewport it will move the brush, actor, and/or vertices that you have selected from any position. This is a good way to move objects that may not be far away or when you don't have to move the screen and don't want to use the widget that is usually used by the object.</p><p>If you just left-click on a brush in the perspective viewport it will select the face of the object. While this is fine for putting a material on the brush, on the other viewports it will select the brush for editing. If you hold<em> Ctrl</em> +<em> Shift</em> and left-click on your map you will notice that you will now select the brush that you clicked on. However, it can sometimes not pick the brush that you think you're selecting, which is why I primarily use the top and/or side viewport.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec04"/>Seeing double</h2></div></div></div><p>Duplicating things that we have already created such as walls or buildings is an effective way of blocking out an environment very quickly. We did this in our previous example by duplicating the room that we created. What we care about most here is creating the best gameplay possible, so we pay less attention to fine details and basically want to just block out an area so we can iterate as quickly as possible. After all, you'd be a lot more willing to get rid of a huge box than a ridiculously detailed office building.</p><p>With the brushes we create we can then give the level to your team's environmental artist (or you if you are gifted with 3D modeling knowledge), who will in turn change the BSP brushes into meshes to place in our level to give it the visual flair that we are looking for.</p><p>After placing a single brush in our level, you don't really need the builder brush again. Unless you are creating something other than a box you can just duplicate brushes and mould them using the<strong> Geometry</strong> tool to quickly shape out areas, which usually makes it much quicker to build. If you too feel as if you can live without the builder brush, you can press the<em> B</em> key to toggle the building brush on and off.<a class="indexterm" id="id361"/>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec04"/>Building our level</h1></div></div></div><p>With knowledge of how to start a workflow, we can now apply that knowledge by building the rest of our level!</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec05"/>Time for action—building our level</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that the beginning of our level is completed, let's add simple buildings and shapes that we can fill with the scripting we created earlier! This is done as follows:<a class="indexterm" id="id362"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">From the top viewport duplicate one of the walls from the rooms that we made previously by left-clicking on it, holding<em> Alt</em> and dragging it down, placing the top end so that the wall covers up the gap between the two doors. In<strong> Geometry</strong> mode grab the two bottom vertices and drag them down to create a square like shape and then in the side viewport drag the vertices up in order to create a building. This is how our screen would look.<div><img alt="Time for action—building our level" height="137" src="img/image_1901_06_09.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">With that first building created we can build others quite easily. Duplicate it by dragging and create three buildings of different sizes to create a blocking path leading the player towards the left. The following screenshot shows this.<a class="indexterm" id="id363"/><div><img alt="Time for action—building our level" height="173" src="img/image_1901_06_10.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Not only can we extend and modify brushes, we can also modify volumes!

We do not want the door to go as far out as the previous version that we created, so select the top six points and drag the door over, adjusting the two at the top afterwards, to create an even door. However, the KActor of the door itself will not change, so right-click on the prefab and select<strong> Convert PrefabInstance into Normal Actors</strong>. From there, you can move the door into its proper spot using the top and side viewports as your guide, building when necessary to help you visualize what the level looks like.</li><li class="listitem">Duplicate buildings changing the heights, placing one to the north of the new door that we added and another north of it to open up a little area for the player to explore. This can be seen in the following top viewport screenshot.<div><img alt="Time for action—building our level" src="img/image_1901_06_12.jpg" width="205"/></div><div><img alt="Time for action—building our level" height="177" src="img/image_1901_06_13.jpg"/></div><p>Note that I purposefully made the building in front of the door's holder to show the player that there is a path that can be taken giving the player a sense of choice in the level.
<a class="indexterm" id="id365"/>
</p><p>At this point, the player can choose one of two paths, which we will converge into a large area. Create buildings of different sizes and shapes to fill a center courtyard, taking care to make the buildings on the furthest north side the lowest of the bunch as that is where we are going to lead the player.
<a class="indexterm" id="id366"/>
</p><div><img alt="Time for action—building our level" src="img/image_1901_06_14.jpg" width="265"/></div></li><li class="listitem">In the center of our courtyard place an elevated pedestal by first creating a box around 32 units high. Build the map then left-click on the face of the brush in the perspective viewport. Change to Scaling mode and shrink the top face. If you build the game you will notice that now the brush has slants. Play the game to make sure that you can walk up and down on the pedestal before moving forward.<p>Elevated ground will draw the player to this position, plus we will place enemies there later so it's a good way to draw attention to the area.
</p></li><li class="listitem">Create ramps leading to the top of the furthest building in much the same way we created ramps for our first room. I personally created a ramp forward, then a straight part and then another ramp for a left turn.

At the <strong>Actor Factory</strong> action click on the plus icon to add a new item to the spawn point list and if it isn't filled already click on the arrow pointing left in order to fill the value with the object we have selected. Exit the subsequence and hook up the items again that were attached to it. When you run your game next it should start working again.
