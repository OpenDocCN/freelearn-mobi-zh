    Xcode, Apple’s programming environment, which is also known as the **Integrated
    Development Environment** (**IDE**). After that, you will start learning the foundations
    of Swift 6, the programming language used in iOS apps, and see how it is used
    to accomplish common programming tasks.

    running it on Simulator or a device, and you’ll have a working knowledge of how
    to use the Swift programming language in order to accomplish common programming
    tasks. This will prepare you for the next chapter and will also enable you to
    create your own Swift programs. Let’s get started!
