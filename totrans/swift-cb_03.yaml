    taking information, inspecting it, making decisions, and producing an output.
    So far, we have seen a lot of ways to represent information, but in this chapter,
    we will explore how to make decisions based on that information using a number
    of Swift's control flow statements. We will find out how they differ and the situations
    where each is appropriate.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The metaphor used in Swift error handling (as well as other languages) is *throwing*
    and *catching*. A method can *throw* an error if a problem occurs during its execution,
    at which point nothing further in the method will be executed, and the error is
    passed back to where the method was called from.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to receive this error (perhaps to provide the details of the error
    to the user), you must *catch* the error at the place the method is called.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To throw an error, you have to declare that the method has the potential to
    throw an error. Declaring that a method `throws` allows the compiler to expect
    potential errors from the method and ensure that you don't forget to catch these
    errors.

    block, within which we may call methods that can throw, and we then define a `catch`
    block that will be executed if any of these methods do throw an error. Each call

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to the `catch` block. Therefore, by placing code after the `try` methods are called,
    we are guaranteeing that it will only be executed if the methods do not throw
    an error. By printing `Dinner is served!` after all the state transitions are
    called, we know this will only print if we have successfully moved through all
    the states. Try changing the order of these state change calls, and you'll see

    is complete or to clean up values that are no longer needed. Let's look at an
    example of updating the state with a `defer` statement.

    classification was a long-running process, and we wanted to keep track of the
    state of the classifier, so we can externally check if the classifier was in the
    middle of classifying or was completed.

- en: As discussed earlier, the last defined `defer` statement is executed first.
    So on the first classification, once the method returns, the last `defer` statement
    is executed and the state is changed to `complete`, because `numberOfClassifications`
    will be `0`. Next, the first `defer` statement is executed, which adds `1` to
    the `numberOfClassifications` variable, which will now be `1`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the second classification, once the method returns, the last `defer` statement
    will execute and change the state to `completeAgain` since `numberOfClassifications`
    is greater than `0`. Finally, the first `defer` statement will execute, incrementing
    `numberOfClassifications` and making it `2`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the `defer` statements had been the other way around, the state would always
    change to `completeAgain`, as `numberOfClassifications` would have incremented
    to `1` before the check was made.

    a classifier object to classify one, and only one, movie review.
