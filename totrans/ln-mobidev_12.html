                    <h1 class="header-title">Do Things That Do Not Scale</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Your very first goal, once you have an MVP, is to push that experiment through its first iteration cycle in order to test your hypothesis. At this stage, the primary purpose is validated learning. Only after you have proved your hypothesis should you consider scaling and optimization.</p>
<p>In the Lean model, improvement happens over time as a result of user feedback. When you make that feedback loop the centerpiece of your initial experiments, a nontraditional set of business practices begins to emerge.</p>
<p>Look at the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to acquire early adopters and establish a small-scale laboratory and why doing so can drastically improve your learning</li>
<li>How to maximize learning with some of the most popular wireframing and prototyping tools</li>
<li>How to balance the need for quality against speed-to-market requirements, budget requirements, or other limitations</li>
<li>The best way to develop a technical debt management plan, which is vital for any app that does begin to scale</li>
</ul>
<p>Before covering these topics, however, let's look at why you should do things that do not scale.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What we mean by "things that do not scale"</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Your goal at this stage is to conduct an experiment, maximize learning, and minimize the time it takes to complete one turn of the build-measure-learn cycle. With the feedback loop as your bull's eye, you will find yourself engaging in activities that may seem superficially illogical, but which greatly accelerate your learning.</p>
<p>For instance, it probably seems extraordinarily inefficient for CEOs or founders to interact directly with customers. If a startup wants to shorten the feedback loop and understand its customers' needs on a deeper level, though, the purpose of this tactic becomes clearer.</p>
<p>Similarly, it may seem wasteful to hand users an interactive wireframe or to present a prototype made up of coding shortcuts and workarounds. When viewed as a stage in an MVP test, however, such an approach makes more sense.</p>
<p>The tools and techniques we explore next may not scale, but they will greatly accelerate early learning and prevent technical errors from overwhelming you as your MVP evolves.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Three reasons to do things that do not scale</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Doing things that do not scale within a narrow market has significant benefits when it comes to experimentation, learning, and product development. Here are three of the biggest reasons to adopt a user-centric focus instead of a traditional production-oriented approach.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Improved testing and data collection</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As we will see, the following are the direct interactions with early adopters, which will provide information that is much more valuable than downstream data collection. Additionally, this feedback will help you implement appropriate changes, features, and redesigns. The sooner you receive necessary feedback, the more money you will save.</p>
<p>Tapping into your customers' minds early on will help prevent costly errors. For instance, take a look at the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up-front data helps you develop the features that customers actually need instead of the ones you think they need</li>
<li>User testing, especially with some of the tools and methods mentioned as follows, will help you create a design that your customers like</li>
<li>Early interactions with your MVP will also make you aware of usability issues sooner rather than later</li>
</ul>
<p>Your first users will help you find the features, designs, and usability workflows that matter most, so you can focus on what's important before you start scaling.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Failure that can be controlled</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Not every experiment will succeed. If your idea is going to fail, then it is better to fail early and fail fast, for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A low-budget experiment that fails inside a contained environment will have a smaller fallout than a full-featured product that fails in a large market</li>
<li>The sooner you discover a mistake or disprove a hypothesis, the sooner you can cut your losses</li>
<li>Failing early with a small audience will limit or eliminate any impact on you or your company's reputation</li>
</ul>
<p>When the Lean methodology is correctly applied, failure becomes a mechanism for learning and adaptation, giving you the opportunity to pivot or start over.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Development of products that are more lovable</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As mentioned previously, an MVP lets you create a product that is targeted, relevant, and useful. Functionality, however, is only half of the equation. People should use your products not just because they need to, but because they want to.</p>
<p>Lovable products have significant advantages over products that are merely usable:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who enjoy using a product will use it more often for longer periods of time</li>
<li>A tribe of passionate users are more likely to talk about your products</li>
<li>Customers who love your product will stay more loyal</li>
</ul>
<p>A lean, learn-first approach should seek to understand not only what your customers want, but how they use apps. When you prioritize the user experience from the very start, you can create products that work with your users, their chosen platforms, and their lives.</p>
<p>Since early adopters are those who feel the strongest need for your product, they will also be your most valuable asset when it comes to improving the user experience.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to acquire early adopters and establish a small-scale laboratory</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you conduct your first tests in a real-world laboratory, your strategies should aim to accelerate the build-measure-learn cycle. As mentioned, since the focus is on learning, not production, much of this early work will be impractical on a larger scale.</p>
<p>The exact nature of the unscalable work will vary from situation to situation. However, the following three strategies will help you accelerate the feedback loop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working within a narrow marketplace facilitates expansion and provides a miniature laboratory within which to work</li>
<li>Manual recruitment of—and interaction with—your users will give you immediate, detailed information about your audience and your ideas</li>
<li>At this early stage, perfecting the user experience with early adopters is often more effective, more efficient, and more economical than doing it later in the process</li>
</ul>
<p>Unscalable work could mean performing tasks manually, doing work outside your comfort zone, or working outside your area of expertise. User acquisition and customer service, for instance, may be arduous or tedious to a coder.</p>
<p>However, given the overwhelming benefits that these strategies offer the lean developer, their importance cannot be emphasized strongly enough. The following three strategies will help you establish a testing ground for your MVP, shorten the build-measure-learn cycle, and push your experiment closer toward scalability.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Focusing on a narrow marketplace</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the beginning, it is very useful to confine an experiment to a narrow marketplace, such as a specific geographic area or a small group. There are several reasons for this, which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expansion and saturation within a targeted marketplace is much easier than within a large one.</li>
<li>A narrow market is a good way to achieve a critical mass of users that will take you from a tribe of early adopters to a majority of users. Once you achieve saturation in one demographic, geographic area, or marketplace, you can use that position as leverage to scale even further.</li>
<li>Data collection and testing is easier, cheaper, and more useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of a small market as a laboratory for the experiment. When proving your first hypotheses, it is often better to learn about your customers in a confined environment. Doing so on a large scale is usually unaffordable and wasteful.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Manually recruiting early adopters</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Paul Graham, cofounder of the renowned startup incubator Y Combinator, probably coined the phrase, "Do things that don't scale."</p>
<p>In a much-cited essay bearing the same name, he said, "The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually." While cumbersome and slow, Graham says that nearly all startups must do this. To make his point, he relates the story of how the payment processing company stripe got started. The founders approached new users in person and used their laptops to create new stripe accounts right there on the spot.</p>
<p>Though certainly not scalable, manual recruitment may be necessary to acquire users. After you have gathered a group of early adopters, you can begin learning from them and evolving your product.</p>
<p>Another significant reason to manually acquire users is genchi genbutsu, a core principle of the Toyota Production System. Jeffrey Liker wrote about this concept in his book, <em>The Toyota Way</em>, which represents two decades of study of Toyota. He said, "You cannot be sure you really understand any part of any business problem unless you go and see for yourself firsthand."</p>
<p>This is why the first users and the firsthand data you collect at this stage are worth their weight in gold. Firsthand interaction will tell you how your users perceive your idea, whether they see it as useful, and whether you will want to pay money for it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Perfecting the user experience</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Steve Jobs once said, "You've gotta start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology."</p>
<p>A similar sentiment was echoed by Airbnb's founders, who said, "We start with the perfect experience and then work backward." It is worth noting that the user experience does not limit itself to a user's interactions with a product—it also includes the user's experience with the company and the company's services.</p>
<p>Since users sit at the center of the lean mindset, it is vital to also place them at the center of product designs. Perfecting the user experience during the experimental phase accomplishes several goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you make their experience as good as possible from the very outset, they will be more willing to offer feedback and forgive any inevitable usability issues</li>
<li>The emotions a product evokes are just as important as how functional it is—improving the emotional experience has as much an impact as improving features or usability</li>
<li>Happier users are more likely to become loyal followers and recommend your products to others</li>
</ul>
<p>To get the most out of your users' participation—from collecting data to building a tribe of advocates—you must do more than just monitor and respond to feedback. It is necessary to offer over-the-top concierge treatment. In other words, treat your first users like royalty.</p>
<p>In the early years of my old company, I used to call customers directly to see if they were happy with the product and their services. I had very little time in my schedule, but getting direct feedback from the ones who used my software told me where I was making mistakes and helped keep the customers satisfied and engaged.</p>
<p>Airbnb's founders also became famous for their hands-on involvement. When their product's growth in New York suffered due to low-quality listings, the founders flew to New York to personally help users fix the problem.</p>
<p>Chebbia said, "We went door to door with cameras taking pictures of all these apartments to put them online. I lived in their living rooms. And home by home, block by block, communities started growing. And people would visit New York and bring the idea back with them to their city."</p>
<p>This example illustrates not only how far your products must go in order to please your users, but also how much you can learn from engaging with them directly.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to transition from an unscalable MVP to scalable code</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>On the one hand, you have the setting for your experiment, which includes your users, the marketplace, and real-world conditions. On the other hand, you have the MVP itself. Although its earliest iterations are just an experiment, it is also an actual product. From the beginning, it is necessary to plan for potential growth.</p>
<p>In this section, we will discuss tools and techniques that will help you test economically and scale sustainably, without being overwhelmed by the ever-present danger of technical debt:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="179" src="img/19b234cc-902c-4238-9a9a-1cdd357cf12b.png" width="271"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Focusing on learning with wireframes and prototypes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As discussed earlier in <a href="aecbb4ed-9567-4aa2-a498-7e11787dda2f.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>A Pragmatic Approach</em>, wireframes and prototyping do not directly scale as actual software code, but they help avoid a lot of downstream problems by giving you something you can present to your users. It is also possible to gather preliminary feedback at these early stages by collecting data on how your users react to your product. As you move forward with design options, you can incorporate this data to determine when and how to add or modify design functionality.</p>
<p>Wireframe sketches and prototypical designs are ideal low-cost options for early design stages. These can come, for instance, in the form of hand-drawn sketches, photoshop files, or HTML mockups. There are also paid tools that bridge the gap between these design files and actual interactive prototypes.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are a number of design tools on the market that specifically assist teams with collaborative design, development, and user testing. These are three of the most popular and useful, although there are others. My team has used all three for quite some time and found them to be very useful. Employing these tools has saved us a lot of time, money, and customer goodwill by ensuring that we learned through prototyping rather than customer complaints.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Zeplin</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Zeplin is aimed at bridging the gap between designers and developers.</p>
<p>Designers can import files from photoshop or sketch, and Zeplin can be used to generate design specs, such as font details and color palettes. It can export sized image files, CSS files, and color files for major platforms. It integrates with Slack and is very simple to use.</p>
<p>I have found that Zeplin is extremely useful in avoiding past pitfalls, where you hand off designs for developers to cut up and apply with the application. Often these hand-offs can be messy, in that the tested designs end up compromised in the process—either consciously or unconsciously—by the developers. Zeplin hands off all the files ready for use, which saves a great deal of time and heartache.</p>
<p>Zeplin is free to try out and pricing can be fairly reasonable, depending on your budget, so it is worth a look if you want to ensure that your tested designs are followed to the pixel.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">InVision</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>InVision is a must-try toolbox for designing and testing in low or high fidelity. It allows product teams to collaborate, co-create, and communicate in real-time with each other and with users. This software suite is ideal for early-stage UI design and experimentation, since you can create interactive designs, present them to test users or stakeholders, and collect qualitative data immediately.</p>
<p>InVision also continues to add more tools and features on a regular basis, further shortening the gap between the drawing board and the prototype. Craft, for instance, allows you to turn sketch or photoshop designs into interactive prototypes that can be tested directly on your phone. The Inspect tool operates like Zeplin by pulling coding specs—such as font information and color palette information—from design files.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">UserTesting.com</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>UserTesting.com offers a range of testing solutions for apps and websites. Video recording, audio recording, and analytics are available for websites, published apps, and unpublished apps. Data is turned around quickly, so you can respond quickly.</p>
<p>One perk of UserTesting.com's tools are that they offer video and audio recording via the users' devices. These allow you to present hard data and real human reactions to stakeholders and other team members. In some cases, when it's necessary to make a case for one design versus another, then this feature can be invaluable by giving you executable feedback from test subjects.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Focusing on scaling and sustainability</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>At this point in the chapter, you understand how and why it is important to acquire early adopters, operate inside a narrow marketplace, and present them with interactive designs and prototypes. However, as your experiments progress, it will become necessary to transition from unscalable prototypes into scalable code. As your MVP evolves, you will be required to make a number of technical decisions. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When to take coding shortcuts</li>
<li>When to automate and optimize</li>
<li>How to handle technical debt</li>
</ul>
<p>From the very beginning of your experiments, these issues should have their place on the table. Understanding such technical considerations will help you deal with them as they arise, so they do not become too costly or overwhelming.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Writing perfect code versus getting the job done</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>At every stage, you must make choices that balance practical needs, such as budgets and release dates, against coding efficiency and stability.</p>
<p>We have seen how the founders of two extremely successful companies prioritize the customer experience and doing whatever it takes to push their product into the marketplace. This means, fortunately or unfortunately, that you cannot be a perfectionist when it comes to coding. When creating your MVP and working within tight constraints, you must put learning first and set aside any attachments to ideal code.</p>
<p>To use a phrase that I love, "Don't make perfect the enemy of good."</p>
<p>Perfecting an experiment should be an ongoing process achieved through customer-guided iterations. If you perfect designs, code, or features that haven't been validated, you run the risk of improving something that will be rejected by your users. To avoid burning money, focus on delivering iterations to market as quickly as possible so you can learn from the real world.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Automation and optimization</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When speed to market is critical, testing and quick delivery take precedence within reason.</p>
<p>At a certain stage in the development lifecycle, you will need to transition from unscalable processes to scalable ones. Although such manual, quick-and-dirty business practices are more economical and even necessary in small marketplaces, they are unsustainable as you improve and grow over time.</p>
<p>Automation—whether in code, deployments, or monitoring—is the foundation of stable, secure, and performant apps. It can be delayed at the start of your project, so you can learn and adapt quickly, but it must be applied over time so as to minimize technical debt and avoid delivering pain to your users via a buggy and unreliable app.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to handle technical debt</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Technical debt, or the extra work that you accrue when taking coding shortcuts, is like financial debt. A little bit can sometimes be necessary but too much can kill you.</p>
<p>As mentioned, if you are a perfectionist, your product will risk going over budget or being delayed indefinitely. However, quick-and-dirty programming will need to be fixed at some point. While perfectionism can overwhelm you in the short run, technical debt can overwhelm you in the long run.</p>
<p>There are different ways of viewing technical debt. You can view it as long-term versus short-term, prudent versus reckless, or intentional versus unintentional. Practically speaking, technical debt, like financial debt, is sometimes necessary to achieve a certain goal. However, in the same way that both types of debt can be useful, they can also get out of control.</p>
<p>The best way to manage technical debt is by intentionally and iteratively eliminating it from the backlog as you proceed through the lifecycle of your product. Notice a pattern here around iterative practices? It is simple; good agile practices can help prevent technical debt from burying you.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for dealing with technical debt:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a technical debt management plan</strong>: A properly executed plan is the first step towards tackling technical debt. It should be engaged with consistently as part of your sprint cycles and should prioritize debt based on how much it affects your customers—from the most impactful to the least impactful.</li>
<li><strong>Log your debt</strong>: A backlog will help you track when, where, and why certain decisions were made. Your log should include estimates for how long shortcuts will take to fix, while remembering that every loan you take out accrues interest over time.</li>
<li><strong>Quantify the debt financially</strong>: Coding time translates into billable hours. Therefore, it should be clear that technical debt translates directly into financial costs. Viewing technical debt through a financial lens will help your teams and your company understand the impacts of development decision-making so that priorities can be set accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Execute your plan</strong>: A technical debt management plan will not help if no one is accountable. Establish documented guidelines, responsible personnel, a repayment schedule, and ensure that your debt management plan is executed on a regular basis.</li>
