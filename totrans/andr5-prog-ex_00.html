This book will take you through the installation and configuration of the development environment with the design, coding and testing processes, and on to publishing and monetizing your mobile apps.</p><p>Along the way, we will develop a series of small, working apps, designed to introduce all the familiar features of mobile apps, such as maps and touchscreen events. We will cover, in detail, the features that are new to Android 5 and higher, particularly the new design language, Material Design.</p><p>To achieve all this, you will use the Android Studio <strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>) and the latest <strong>Software Development Kit</strong> (<strong>SDK</strong>). To test and debug apps, you will be able to use real devices connected to your computer and create virtual devices that emulate Android devices. All this software is open source and free to download and use.</p><p>The Android platform is no longer restricted to phones and tablets, and, later in the book, you will be taken on a brief tour of Android Wear, TV, and Auto, learning how to adapt and extend the existing apps and create new apps designed specifically for these form factors.</p><p>Logically, the book concludes with a detailed explanation of how to register as a Google Developer and publish your apps. To reach the widest possible number of users, you will see how to make Android 5 apps backwards compatible and include the Lollipop features on an older version. Finally, how to include in-app purchasing and advertising is covered, and at that point, you will be fully equipped to develop and distribute apps of your own invention.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>If you have a great idea for a mobile app and a little knowledge of procedural programming languages such as Java, this book is for you. No actual experience of developing apps or even working with IDEs is required.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "From a practical point of view, the SDK provides us with two versions of material theme (light and dark) and two widgets, <code class="literal">CardView</code> for simple content and <code class="literal">RecyclerView</code> for lists."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">ArrayList&lt;MainDataDef&gt; mainData = new ArrayList&lt;MainDataDef&gt;();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; MainData.nameArray.length; i++) {
    mainData.add(new MainDataDef(
            MainData.imageArray[i],
            MainData.infoArray[i]
    ));
})</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;activity
    android:name=".DetailActivity"
    <strong>android:label="@string/title_activity_detail"</strong>&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Select <strong>Blank Activity</strong> and leave everything else as is, or choose your own values."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
