- en: In the last few years, multiplatform development has become a must in the game
    developer’s skill set. Moai SDK is a great free and open source solution for this.
    This book will introduce you to the ways of developing games with Moai SDK using
    Lua; after reading it, you should be good to go and create the next hit mobile
    game!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moai SDK is a minimalist framework for professional game developers. This means
    that some of its features may be hard for complete beginners. However, this book
    aims to help beginners get into Moai SDK. You’ll need some basic understanding
    on programming (Lua knowledge is not *required* but extremely recommended) and
    basic command-line familiarity (in order to run our games).
