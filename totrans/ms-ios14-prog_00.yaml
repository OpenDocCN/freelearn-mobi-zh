- en: All sample code in this book was written in Swift 5.3, at the time of writing
    Swift 5.4 is the latest release and the book is compatible with the new release,
    with Xcode 12.4 on a Mac running macOS Big Sur. To follow along with all the examples
    in this book, you must have at least Xcode 12.4 installed on your machine. It
    is recommended that you also have at least macOS Big Sur installed on your Mac
    because not all code samples are compatible with older versions of macOS.

    If you have no experience with Swift at all, it is recommended that you skim through
    Apple's Swift manual and go over the basics of iOS development. You don't have
    to be an expert on iOS development yet, but a solid foundation won't hurt you
    since the pacing of the book is aimed at somewhat experienced developers.
