			<p>Design patterns enable you as a developer to speed up the development process by providing you with proven development paradigms. Reusing design patterns helps prevent complex issues that can cause major problems, improves your code base, promotes code reuse, and makes an architecture more robust.</p>&#13;
			<p>The mission of this book is to ease the adoption of design patterns in Kotlin and provide good practices for programmers.</p>&#13;
			<p>The book begins by showing you the practical aspects of smarter coding in Kotlin, explaining the basic Kotlin syntax and the impact of design patterns. From there, the book provides an in-depth explanation of the classical creational, structural, and behavioral design pattern families, before heading into functional programming. It then takes you through reactive and concurrent patterns, teaching you about using streams, threads, and coroutines to write better code along the way.</p>&#13;
			<p>By the end of the book, you will be able to efficiently address common problems faced while developing applications and be comfortable working on scalable and maintainable projects of any size.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>&#13;
			<p>This book is for developers who would like to master design patterns with Kotlin in order to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications. Prior programming knowledge is highly advised in order to get started with this book. Prior design pattern knowledge would be helpful, but is not mandatory.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>&#13;
			<p><a href="B17816_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Kotlin</em>, covers basic Kotlin syntax and discusses what design patterns are good for and why they should be used in Kotlin. The goal of this chapter is not to cover the entire Kotlin vocabulary but to get you familiar with some basic concepts and idioms. The following chapters will slowly expose you to more language features as they become relevant to the design patterns we'll discuss.</p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B17816_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Creational Patterns</em>, explains all the classical creational patterns. These patterns deal with how and when to create your objects. Mastering these patterns will allow you to manage the life cycle of your objects better and write code that is easy to maintain. </p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B17816_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor080"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding Structural Patterns</em>, focuses on how to create hierarchies of objects that are flexible and simple to extend. It covers the Decorator and Adapter patterns, among others.</p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B17816_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Familiar with Behavioral Patterns</em>, covers behavioral patterns with Kotlin. Behavioral patterns deal with how objects interact with one another and how objects can change behavior dynamically. We'll see how objects can communicate efficiently and in a decoupled manner.</p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B17816_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor144"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing Functional Programming</em>, covers the basic principles of functional programming and how they fit into the Kotlin programming language. It will cover topics such as immutability, higher-order functions, and functions as values.</p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B17816_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Threads and Coroutines</em>, dives deeper into how to launch new threads in Kotlin and covers the reasons why coroutines can scale much better than threads. We will discuss how the Kotlin compiler treats coroutines and the relationship with coroutine scopes and dispatchers.</p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B17816_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor178"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Controlling the Data Flow</em>, covers higher-order functions for collections. We'll see how sequences, channels, and flows apply those functions in a concurrent and reactive manner.</p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B17816_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor198"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Designing for Concurrency</em>, explains how concurrent design patterns help us manage many tasks at once and structure their life cycle. By using these patterns efficiently, we can avoiding problems such as resource leaks and deadlocks. </p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B17816_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Idioms and Anti-Patterns</em>, discusses the best and worst practices in Kotlin. You'll learn what idiomatic Kotlin code should look like and also which patterns to avoid. After completing this chapter, you should be able to write more readable and maintainable Kotlin code, as well as avoiding some common pitfalls.</p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B17816_10_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor237"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Concurrent Microservices with Ktor</em>, puts the skills we've learned so far to use by building a microservice using the Kotlin programming language. For that, we'll use the Ktor framework, which was developed by JetBrains.</p>&#13;
			<p><a href="B17816_11_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor251"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Reactive Microservices with Vert.x</em>, demonstrates an alternative approach to building microservices with Kotlin by using the Vert.x framework, which is based on reactive design patterns. We'll discuss the tradeoffs between the approaches, looking at some real code examples, and figure out when to use them.</p>&#13;
			<p><em class="italic">Assessments</em> contains all the answers to the questions from all the chapters in this book.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>&#13;
			<p>You should have basic knowledge of Java and know what the JVM is. It is also assumed that you are comfortable working with the command line. A few command-line examples we use in this book are based on OS X but could be easily adapted for Windows or Linux.</p>&#13;

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Conventions used</h1>&#13;
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>&#13;
			<p><code>Code in text</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "From the listener side, handling exceptions is as simple as wrapping the <code>collect()</code> function in a <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> block."</p>&#13;
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>&#13;
			<pre>val chan = produce(capacity = 10) { </pre>&#13;
			<pre>    (1..10).forEach { </pre>&#13;
			<pre>        send(it) </pre>&#13;
			<pre>    } </pre>&#13;
			<pre>}</pre>&#13;
			<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>&#13;
			<pre>flow {</pre>&#13;
			<pre>    (1..10).forEach {</pre>&#13;
			<pre>    ...</pre>&#13;
			<pre><strong class="bold">        if (it == 9) {</strong></pre>&#13;
			<pre><strong class="bold">            throw RuntimeException()</strong></pre>&#13;
			<pre><strong class="bold">        }</strong></pre>&#13;
			<pre>    }</pre>&#13;
			<pre>}</pre>&#13;
			<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>&#13;
			<pre>...</pre>&#13;
			<pre>4 seconds -&gt; received 30</pre>&#13;
			<pre>5 seconds -&gt; received 40</pre>&#13;
			<pre>6 seconds -&gt; received 49</pre>&#13;
			<pre>...</pre>&#13;
			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: "On the next screen, choose <strong class="bold">JUnit 5</strong> as your <strong class="bold">Test framework</strong> and set <strong class="bold">Target JVM version</strong> to <strong class="bold">1.8</strong>, then click <strong class="bold">Finish</strong>."</p>&#13;
