<p>The lean start-up methodology has become a well-known term in the start-up land. There are many books covering this (and related methodologies) such as The Lean Startup (Eric ries), Running Lean (Ash Maurya), The start-up owner manual (Steve Blank), and The Four steps to the epiphany (Steve Blank).</p>
<p>The lean start-up methodology is, among other things, about reducing waste by gathering feedback earlier. It makes no sense to develop a brilliant app for six months or longer only to find out later that nobody is interested in it.</p>
<p>Your start-up, or even an existing app, needs multiple but short iterations to find out what works and what does not. That raises questions such as: Does your app actually solve a problem worth solving it? And how does the lean start-up methodology come into this?</p>
<p>All the books are currently focused on business-oriented members of your start-up or company. However, a pragmatic approach for the technical-oriented members of a company, with a mobile first strategy, is missing in particular. Theory is cool but a practical approach could help developers to move faster.</p>
<p>This book tries to fill that gap. It explains the elements of the Lean Start Up methodology and elaborates on research and on implementation. In particular, the focus is on things that need to be done from a technical point of view. That makes this book a down-to-earth guide on how to apply the lean start-up methodology to real Android and iOS development. As such, it comes without any mumbo-jumbo. If you want real action and if you want to develop an app that people need and really want to use, then this guide is for you.</p>

<p>In the first place, this book is to inspire technical-oriented cofounders of start-ups and existing business technical leaders seeking to integrate lead into their development operations. In addition, there are some Android and iOS code samples that we discuss to explain some of the concepts. Although the concept is more important than the code, you can try the sample for yourself. Where applicable, you can find a link to the Github repository, containing the code.</p>
<p>For the Android examples, you need to have <strong>Android Studio 3</strong> (or above) and the Android SDKs installed on your computer. <strong>Android Studio</strong> is available as a free download for Windows, OSX, and other operating systems. The Android examples are written in Kotlin and Java.</p>
<p>The samples for iOS requires <strong>xCode 9</strong> or above (xCode is available on OSX only and you need to have a paid Apple developer's account). The iOS examples are written in Swift 4.</p>
<p>Some examples require a (free) registration at Firebase, Facebook, Fabric, or other services.</p>

<p>In particular, the audience of this book will be technical cofounders, developers, or CTO's working in a start-up environment. However, if you are a CTO, Development Director, or developer of an existing software company, then this is for you too. Lean, when applied well, helps start-ups and existing copanies equally.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>All Android and iOS examples and descriptions are based on Android Studio, xCode and various third party services, running on a OSX machine.</p>
<p>Console input is shown as:</p>
<pre><strong>$ gem install cocoapods</strong></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>func refresh (sender: AnyObject!) {<br/>...<br/>        let cngQuery = client.queryDataset("wwmu-gmzc")<br/>        cngQuery.orderAscending("title").get { res in<br/>            switch res {<br/>            case .Dataset (let data):<br/>                self.data = data<br/>...<br/>        }<br/>    }<br/>Data (XML, JSON or otherwise) is shown as:<br/>&lt;key&gt;UberClientID&lt;/key&gt;<br/>    &lt;string&gt;your uber client id&lt;/string&gt;<br/>    &lt;key&gt;UberCallbackURI&lt;/key&gt;<br/>    &lt;string&gt;&lt;/string&gt;<br/>    &lt;key&gt;LSApplicationQueriesSchemes&lt;/key&gt;<br/>    &lt;array&gt;<br/>        &lt;string&gt;uber&lt;/string&gt;<br/>    &lt;/array&gt;</pre>
<p>Where you need to apply your own client ID, API key or API secret it, for example, reads as: <kbd>your client_id</kbd> within the code or the data.</p>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> button moves you to the next screen."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">
<p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p>
</div>
<div class="packt_tip">
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
