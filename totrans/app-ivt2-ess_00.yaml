- en: Almost everyone has had an idea for an app or perhaps declared, "I wish there
    were an app for that!" But until recently, taking an idea and building it into
    a fully functional app would have required hiring an expert software programmer
    and paying thousands and thousands of dollars. The world of mobile app development
    had been the domain of an elite group of people with highly specialized skills—proficient
    coders. The App Inventor project sought to change this reality by democratizing
    software development. App Inventor 2 is a free, blocks-based, drag-and-drop visual
    programming language that makes it possible for anyone, even people with no prior
    coding experience, to turn an idea into a fully functional Android app.

    to move from being users of technology to becoming creators of technology were
    the inspirations for writing this book. With App Inventor, a 12-year-old, a speech
    therapist, a baseball coach, or anyone else for that matter, can develop an app
    that is personal, meaningful, and useful to them. People from all backgrounds
    and levels of education can develop a digital solution to a problem they see in
    their community. Any App Inventor app, such as an educational game, a music tutorial,
    or a garbage recycling program can be published or sold in app markets, and thus,
    have a global impact or spurn opportunities for entrepreneurship, collaboration,
    and community building.

    user-friendly and less intimidating than traditional cryptic white-text-on-a-black-screen
    programming. The colorful blocks that snap together like puzzle pieces along with
    a design tools enable users to learn both coding and user experience design skills.
    Furthermore, with a wide gender gap in computer science—males dominating both
    classes and jobs—we are also passionate about using App Inventor to introduce
    more girls and women to mobile computing opportunities, such as app contests with
    Technovation ([www.technovationchallenge.org](http://www.technovationchallenge.org))
    and coding clubs with Girls Who Code ([www.girlswhocode.com](http://www.girlswhocode.com)).

    for imagination, creativity, and innovation are indeed endless. The purpose of
    this book is to help spark such creativity while introducing you to basic computer
    science principles, computational thinking, and programming. This book teaches
    you to navigate the App Inventor platform and helps you become familiar with its
    features through step-by-step tutorials on building three different mobile apps.
    Throughout the book, we offer design tools and tips as a pathway to user experience
    design, since the user interface is such an integral part of any mobile app. Ultimately,
    by the end of this book, you will be equipped with enough skills to embark on
    developing your own mobile app from scratch. We are excited to see the apps you
    are inspired to create and hope that you will share them with us.

    "Chapter 1. Unleashing Creativity with MIT App Inventor 2"), *Unleashing Creativity
    with MIT App Inventor 2,* introduces you to the MIT App Inventor software and
    explores the multifaceted role of the mobile app developer by examining design
    processes and techniques used to turn an app idea into a prototype. By showing
    a variety of apps that people just like you have already made, this chapter reveals
    the range of learning outcomes and skills developed by using App Inventor.'

    "Chapter 2. Setting Up MIT App Inventor 2"), *Setting Up MIT App Inventor 2*,
    walks you through setting up a Google Account to log into App Inventor, downloading
    software, and connecting your computer to your mobile device via Wi-Fi or USB
    with Mac, Windows, or GNU/Linux. MIT App Inventor 2 is a free online application
    that runs in a web browser on your computer and saves your projects in the cloud.
    The magical part of App Inventor is live testing your app as you build it with
    the **Integrated Development Environment** (**IDE**). If you don''t have a mobile
    device, don''t worry, there are instructions on how to use App Inventor with the
    onscreen emulator. While we provide a step-by-step guide to getting started, we
    acknowledge that sometimes establishing connectivity can be a challenge. Therefore,
    we include plenty of troubleshooting and help options.'

    "Chapter 3. Navigating the App Inventor Platform"), *Navigating the App Inventor
    Platform*, familiarizes you with the App Inventor Projects View, Designer screen,
    and Blocks Editor. This chapter teaches you how to build a game app called Fling.
    The step-by-step tutorial integrates components and properties to design the user
    interface and colorful puzzle-like blocks to code the behavior of the game. You
    learn how to create buttons that start or reset play, move a ball, change the
    ball''s direction by touching it, bounce the ball off the edges of the screen,
    and end game play. During each step of the development process, we show you how
    to view the changes on your mobile device. By the end of the chapter, you will
    have built a functional app! However, we have just gotten started on our app development
    journey.'

    "Chapter 3. Navigating the App Inventor Platform") as a launching pad for further
    skill development: debugging and expanding the app with more complex features.
    Since most games keep score and have increasing levels and difficulty, we augment
    the Fling tutorial to make a more intermediate app. You learn how to make a scoring
    mechanism, display the score, increase the speed of the ball, create levels, increase
    the difficulty of play, and debug by updating the Play and Reset buttons.'

    "Chapter 5. Building an Event App"), *Building an Event App*, provides a tutorial
    for building a second app—this time, an intermediate event-planning app. An app
    like this can be useful for anyone who is gathering people together for meetings,
    parties, or events. It gathers information from people who would like to attend,
    namely, their name, the number of guests, and the pot-luck items to be brought.
    In return, the app displays to users a guest list and the event information, such
    as the address and a map. The tutorial teaches you how to include images and artwork,
    create a navigation menu, use the Backpack tool, add multiple screens, expand
    your use of labels, and include a map component. By the end of the chapter, you
    will have accomplished a great deal, but will only be halfway through the Event
    App development.'

    "Chapter 6. Introduction to Databases"), *Introduction to Databases*, will cover
    databases that are an essential part of app designing because they store persistent
    data, meaning that when the app closes and reopens, the previously entered data
    will remain in the App. Without a database, any data entered by the user when
    the app is running would be lost once the app is closed. In order to collect user-inputted
    information for the Event app, this chapter''s tutorial demonstrates how to create
    an RSVP form, establish Google API credentials, store and request information
    in a database using Google Fusion Tables, and display a guest list.'

    "Chapter 7. Learning About Loops with a Raffle App"), *Learning About Loops with
    a Raffle App*, will cover a third tutorial—this time, for a Raffle App that includes
    the computer science principles of lists, loops, and variables. The Raffle App
    (a digital version of a regular raffle) can be used at a party, meeting break,
    or as an ice-breaker to involve participants in a short fun activity. Participants
    text a specific message to the Raffle organizer''s phone and the app randomly
    selects a winner from the list of incoming numbers and then notifies the winner
    he or she has won and texts the rest of the participants that they did not win.
    Here, you will learn to code efficiently with variables and a loop, as the app
    repeats the same behavior (texting a "Sorry you did not win!" message) for a list
    of many people.'

    App Development Skills*, includes more design principles and App Inventor tips
    to broaden your skill set for your transition from app building with guided tutorials
    to creating mobile apps from scratch. Also included are app sharing tools that
    enable you to contribute your creativity and learn from other app developers.
    Since all the App Inventor apps can be uploaded, shared, and even sold in app
    markets, the apps you develop can make a global social impact or trigger your
    path as an entrepreneur. The world awaits your contribution!'
