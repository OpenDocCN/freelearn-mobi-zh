We will start from no account to publishing on the App Store.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding and setting up your developer account</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up a provisioning profile</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Publishing the app on the Store</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec34"/>Setting up a developer account</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, you <a class="indexterm" id="id456"/>will learn how to register for Apple's iOS Developer Program, how to generate the various required certificates, ways to configure our app, and finally, the step-by-step process to submit the app to the App Store for approval. For this chapter, we have created a fresh, new App Store account and, down the line, we have also submitted a new app to Apple's App Store.</p><p>We are going to submit the improved version of the <em>AntKiller</em> game app that we created in <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. APIs Introduced in iOS 7">Chapter 4</a>, <em>APIs Introduced in iOS 7</em>, using the SpriteKit game engine.</p><p>The following are the prerequisites to complete this chapter:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You will need a web browser</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You will need a valid credit card</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You will also need $99</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It's mandatory to have a Mac computer, preferably with OS X 10.9 Mavericks installed to develop apps</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Finally, you <a class="indexterm" id="id457"/>will need Xcode 6, Apple's development software; you can download it from <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=Xcode">https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=Xcode</a></li></ul></div><p>Xcode can be downloaded once you are registered as an Apple iOS developer. After completing the first few sections of this tutorial, you will be registered in the Apple Developer Program.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec35"/>Getting started</h1></div></div></div><p>Registering on Apple's Developer portal is our first step on the way to publish our app on the App Store. To become an iOS developer, you will have to pay the aforementioned fee of $99 <a class="indexterm" id="id458"/>USD or pay $299 USD for an Enterprise account. However, for an Enterprise account, you will need an additional <strong>DUNS</strong> (<strong>Data Universal Numbering System</strong>) number before registering your account.</p><p>If you already have a <a class="indexterm" id="id459"/>developer account with Apple, feel free to skip this section and move on to the next one. If you don't have an Apple <a class="indexterm" id="id460"/>developer account, go to the <strong>iOS Dev Center</strong> (<a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action">https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action</a>) and click on the <code class="literal">register for free</code> link, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Getting started" src="img/1829OT_07_01.jpg"/></div><p>Click on the <strong>Get Started</strong> button as shown in the red highlighted box:</p><div><img alt="Getting started" src="img/1829OT_07_02.jpg"/></div><p>Here, on this page, you can either opt to create a fresh new Apple ID or use your existing Apple ID. If you want to save time, you can use the same Apple ID that you already use for your iTunes account purchases, for example. However, to follow the steps in the chapter, we would <a class="indexterm" id="id461"/>suggest that you create a fresh, new Apple ID. This will help you make sure that all your data is correct.</p><p>So, to create a new Apple ID, select <strong>CreateApple ID</strong> as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Getting started" src="img/1829OT_07_03.jpg"/></div><p>Fill in the form (shown in the following screenshot) with all the required details such as your e-mail, password, and security information. It's recommended that you use the e-mail address that you <a class="indexterm" id="id462"/>check often, because Apple sends all the updates of your Developer Program and the status of the apps that you've submitted for approval.</p><div><img alt="Getting started" src="img/1829OT_07_04.jpg"/></div><p>Fill in all your <a class="indexterm" id="id463"/>personal information by scrolling down and then click on <strong>Create Apple ID</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Getting started" src="img/1829OT_07_05.jpg"/></div><p>The next page holds questions related to your professional profile. This page will also ask you about the apps you develop and so on. Fill in all the answers as per your best knowledge. Scroll <a class="indexterm" id="id464"/>down and complete the following form and the click on <strong>Continue</strong>:</p><div><img alt="Getting started" src="img/1829OT_07_06.jpg"/><div><p>The Continue button</p></div></div><p>The next page is the legal agreement. Read the document, select the checkbox, and click on <strong>I Agree</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Getting started" src="img/1829OT_07_07.jpg"/><div><p>Legal agreement</p></div></div><p>Now, the registration is completed. Just verify your e-mail address that you used to register. You should <a class="indexterm" id="id465"/>receive an e-mail to confirm your e-mail address. Click on the link sent in the Apple registration confirmation mail as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Getting started" src="img/1829OT_07_08.jpg"/></div><p>Congratulations! You are now an Apple developer. Before you can start developing iOS applications and submitting <a class="indexterm" id="id466"/>them to Apple's App Store, you need to click on <strong>Continue</strong> (as shown in the following screenshot) and buy the iOS application development program:</p><div><img alt="Getting started" src="img/1829OT_07_09.jpg"/><div><p>The Continue button</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec46"/>Joining the iOS Developer Program</h2></div></div></div><p>Using your <a class="indexterm" id="id467"/>developer Apple ID provides you with access to many resources and information. However, it still doesn't allow you to publish your apps on Apple's App Store. To gain more access to Apple's app-publishing feature, you will have to enroll yourself in Apple's iOS Developer Program. This, in turn, will cost you $99 USD per year,</p><p>After clicking on <strong>Continue</strong> on the page shown in the preceding screenshot, you will be redirected to the right place. Otherwise, if you already have an Apple developer account and have chosen to skip the previous section, then go to the <strong>Developer Member Center</strong>, log in, and you'll be in sync.</p><p>Once you are logged in, just click on the <strong>Join Today</strong> link that is on the top-right corner of the page, flagged in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Joining the iOS Developer Program" src="img/1829OT_07_10.jpg"/><div><p>The Join Today link</p></div></div><p>Then, click on <strong>Continue</strong> on the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Joining the iOS Developer Program" src="img/1829OT_07_11.jpg"/><div><p>The Continue button</p></div></div><p>Now, select <strong>Existing </strong><a class="indexterm" id="id468"/><strong>Apple Developer</strong> and click on <strong>Continue</strong>, as shown here:</p><div><img alt="Joining the iOS Developer Program" src="img/1829OT_07_12.jpg"/><div><p>Selecting the Existing Apple Developer option and the Continue button</p></div></div><p>On the next page, we need to decide whether we want to enroll as an individual or as a company. In this chapter, we will enroll ourselves as an individual, as shown in the following screenshot. Enrolling yourself as a company is a little complicated, as it needs you to submit a lot <a class="indexterm" id="id469"/>more paperwork to prove your involvement in the company.</p><div><img alt="Joining the iOS Developer Program" src="img/1829OT_07_13.jpg"/><div><p>The Individual button</p></div></div><p>Now, when you click on <strong>Individual</strong>, the next screen will be the login screen. Here, you will have to provide your newly created credentials again. After this, click on <strong>Sign In</strong>.</p><p>Now, in the next screen after you log in, you will have to provide your billing information to verify your identity, as shown in the following screenshot. To make sure that you have provided the correct card information, Apple attempts to confirm this information with your credit card company. Always make sure that you have provided the correct details.</p><div><img alt="Joining the iOS Developer Program" src="img/1829OT_07_15.jpg"/></div><p>Fill in the complete <a class="indexterm" id="id470"/>form by scrolling down and then click on <strong>Continue</strong>, as shown here:</p><div><img alt="Joining the iOS Developer Program" src="img/1829OT_07_16.jpg"/><div><p>The Continue button</p></div></div><p>Clicking on <strong>Continue</strong> will redirect you to the program-selection page. Now, we have to select a program. In <a class="indexterm" id="id471"/>this chapter, our primary focus is on the iOS Developer Program, so we are going to select this option only.</p><p>After selecting your program, click on <strong>Continue</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Joining the iOS Developer Program" src="img/1829OT_07_17.jpg"/><div><p>The Continue button</p></div></div><p>Now, once you have clicked on <strong>Continue</strong>, you will be asked to review your information to correct any visible <a class="indexterm" id="id472"/>mistakes if necessary. Once you have reviewed this, you can submit it by clicking on <strong>Continue</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Joining the iOS Developer Program" src="img/1829OT_07_18.jpg"/></div><p>Now, accept the license <a class="indexterm" id="id473"/>agreement and click on <strong>I Agree</strong>, as shown here:</p><div><img alt="Joining the iOS Developer Program" src="img/1829OT_07_19.jpg"/><div><p>License agreement</p></div></div><p>You will be redirected to a payment-information page as shown in the following screenshot. Fill in all the <a class="indexterm" id="id474"/>details related to your payment and shipping address and then click on <strong>Continue</strong>.</p><div><img alt="Joining the iOS Developer Program" src="img/1829OT_07_20.jpg"/><div><p>The payment-information page</p></div></div><p>Now, follow the payment procedure; once the payment of $99 USD is successfully done, you will be redirected <a class="indexterm" id="id475"/>back to the Apple payment-confirmation page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Joining the iOS Developer Program" src="img/1829OT_07_23.jpg"/><div><p>The payment-confirmation page</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec47"/>Getting started with the iOS Developer account</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you submit and <a class="indexterm" id="id476"/>pay for your iOS developer registration process, you will have to wait for a day or so for Apple to process your order.</p><p>Once your order is successfully processed, you will receive an e-mail from Apple, like the one shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Getting started with the iOS Developer account" src="img/1829OT_07_24.jpg"/></div><p>You will also receive an <a class="indexterm" id="id477"/>e-mail for your <strong>iTunes Connect</strong> account, as shown here:</p><div><img alt="Getting started with the iOS Developer account" src="img/1829OT_07_25.jpg"/></div><p>Now, you can download Xcode, the tool mainly used for iOS development, if you have not already done so, using your new iOS developer credentials. We will briefly use Xcode in this chapter to understand the process of publishing an app to the App Store.</p><p>Now, go <a class="indexterm" id="id478"/>to the <strong>iOS Dev Center</strong> (<a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action">https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action</a>) and click on <strong>Sign In</strong>, as <a class="indexterm" id="id479"/>shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Getting started with the iOS Developer account" src="img/1829OT_07_26.jpg"/></div><p>After logging in with your credentials, you will finally observe the changes. The iOS Dev Center has a lot of information for you now. You will find various programming guides, downloads, <strong>Worldwide Developers Conference</strong> (<strong>WWDC</strong>) videos, and documentations; the most <a class="indexterm" id="id480"/>important part is the very helpful developer forum and a support center.</p><p>In this chapter, our primary focus is on the two portals that will be widely used while developing your <a class="indexterm" id="id481"/>iOS apps: the <strong>iOS Provisioning Portal</strong> and <strong>iTunes Connect</strong>, shown <a class="indexterm" id="id482"/>in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Getting started with the iOS Developer account" src="img/1829OT_07_27.jpg"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec48"/>The iOS Provisioning Portal</h2></div></div></div><p>It's a fact that a <a class="indexterm" id="id483"/>non-jailbroken iOS device is only able to install and run apps that are approved by Apple and are available on the App Store.</p><p>Apple has a special security check to accomplish this; every app run on an iOS device must have a signed Apple certificate. However, for the App Store, applications come with a bundled certificate that is verified by the system before it allows the app to run. The app is considered as invalid if no signature is found, and the system refuses to run such apps.</p><p>Developers have to compile and run their apps very often while developing them. To compile and run apps while developing, developers need a way to create and sign their apps using their own certificates.</p><p>This is where the iOS Provisioning Portal comes into picture. You can generate your profiles using this portal. Profiles can also be understood as "code-signing identities". These files are generated by the iOS Provisioning Portal, which is used by Xcode to sign your apps.</p><p>It is important to know about the two types of profiles: development profiles and distribution profiles. They are explained here:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Development profiles</strong>: These profiles are tied to specific devices, so the app can only <a class="indexterm" id="id484"/>run on these devices. Developers can add their device UDID in the Developer portal; this will allow the <a class="indexterm" id="id485"/>profile to pass the validation while installing the app on the device.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Distribution profiles</strong>: These profiles are specifically used to sign your app before you <a class="indexterm" id="id486"/>submit it to Apple for approval. These profiles do <a class="indexterm" id="id487"/>not hold any device-specific details; hence, you yourself can't install the app on your device using this profile. These profiles are deviceless profiles as, after approving the app, Apple will sign the app and publish it for all the users.</li></ul></div><p>These Provisioning Portal are also used to generate push-notification certificates if you want your app to send them.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec49"/>iTunes Connect</h2></div></div></div><p>The iTunes <a class="indexterm" id="id488"/>Connect portal takes control of your app's submission process. In this portal, you will register your new apps along with their description, meta tags, screenshots, price, and in-app purchase to publish them to the App Store.</p><p>This also allows you to agree to new contracts. You can also set your financial data in this portal and check your sales. This portal gives access to various analytics such as crash reports, download information, and so on.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec50"/>Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles</h2></div></div></div><p>We will <a class="indexterm" id="id489"/>explore the certificates, identifiers, and profiles in this section to set up the profiles for our app-deploying process; this app will be published later on the App Store. Now, click on <strong>Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles</strong>, as shown in the previous screenshot, or click on the link (<a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/account/overview.action">https://developer.apple.com/account/overview.action</a>). The resulting screenshot is as follows:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_28.jpg"/></div><p>Click on <a class="indexterm" id="id490"/><strong>Certificates</strong>, and you will see something similar to the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_29.jpg"/></div><p>Now, click on the <strong>+</strong> button to create a new certificate, and this page will ask you which certificate you want to <a class="indexterm" id="id491"/>create. Select the <strong>iOS App Development</strong> certificate from the <strong>Development</strong> section and click on <strong>Continue</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_30.jpg"/></div><p>Now, follow the <a class="indexterm" id="id492"/>process as specified in the following certificate-generation page and click on <strong>Continue</strong>:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_31.jpg"/></div><p>Now, upload the <code class="literal">.certSigningRequest</code> file you just created using the listed instructions. The <a class="indexterm" id="id493"/>page should look something similar to the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_32.jpg"/></div><p>Now, clicking on <a class="indexterm" id="id494"/><strong>Generate</strong> will create a development certificate; this might take a few minutes. Once the certificate is created, you will be able to see it in the list of your certificates, as shown here:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_33.jpg"/></div><p>Click on the certificate <a class="indexterm" id="id495"/>to download or revoke. The result is shown in this screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_34.jpg"/></div><p>Now, we have successfully created our certificate. It's time to add it in Xcode. Open Xcode and go to <strong>File</strong> | <strong>Preferences</strong>. Now, click on <strong>Accounts</strong> from the icons at the top of the screen. This should <a class="indexterm" id="id496"/>look similar to the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_35.jpg"/></div><p>Now, you can see that, currently, there is no account synced with Xcode. So, click on the <strong>+</strong> button in the bottom-left corner of the screen and add the account we created in the previous steps. The account pop-up should look similar to the one shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_36.jpg"/></div><p>After successful login, you <a class="indexterm" id="id497"/>will be able to see your account and related profiles in the list, as shown here:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_37.jpg"/></div><p>Now, let's move back to the browser in our Apple Developer portal. The next step will be to register our devices in the Developer portal.</p><p>Now open the browser and <a class="indexterm" id="id498"/>let's continue. The next step is to register our devices. In the left menu, click on <strong>Devices</strong> and select <code class="literal">All</code>. Then, on the right-hand side, click on the <strong>+</strong> button to add devices, as shown in this screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_38.jpg"/></div><p>To add a device, you will need the UDID of the device(s) on which you want to run your apps. You can get the UDID <a class="indexterm" id="id499"/>of the device either through Xcode's organizer or iTunes. You can open iTunes and click on <strong>Summary</strong> to get the UDID of the device, as shown here:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_39.jpg"/><div><p>The Summary button</p></div></div><p>Now, we have all that we need to add the device. Click on the <strong>+</strong> button and provide the device's UDID along with the <a class="indexterm" id="id500"/>device name. After providing the details, click on <strong>Continue</strong> as shown here:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_40.jpg"/></div><p>Confirm the <a class="indexterm" id="id501"/>submission by clicking on <strong>Register</strong> as shown in the following screenshot. You can add up to 100 devices in this list to debug your app.</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_41.jpg"/></div><p>Now, we have successfully registered the device, so it's time to register an app ID. All the apps that we build have a unique app ID. Click on <strong>App IDs</strong> on the left-hand side of the screen to register your new app ID. Click on the <strong>+</strong> button and fill in all the required details for the app as shown in the following <a class="indexterm" id="id502"/>screenshot. You can also read the complete description of the app ID from Apple's help text at the top of the screen.</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_42.jpg"/></div><p>Fill in all the necessary details and click on <strong>Continue</strong>. The app ID will be shown in the list automatically after being successfully created.</p><p>Now, it's time for the last <a class="indexterm" id="id503"/>step. We will create a provisioning profile that will actually bundle all the steps we followed in the previous sections. The provisioning profile binds the developer's certificate with the app ID to allow the app to run on the device that is permitted in the provisioning profile. Follow the same steps used in creating certificates and identifiers, click on the <strong>Provisioning Profiles</strong> section, and select <strong>All</strong>. Then, click on the <strong>+</strong> button in the top-right corner of the screen. Then, in the form, select <strong>iOS App Development</strong> under the <strong>Development</strong> section. You should see the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_43.jpg"/></div><p>Now, select your app ID that <a class="indexterm" id="id504"/>you created in the previous section and click on <strong>Continue</strong>. The selection screen will look similar to the one shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_44.jpg"/></div><p>Then, on the next <a class="indexterm" id="id505"/>screen, select the list of iOS certificates for which this profile will be available and click on <strong>Continue</strong>. The selection screen should look similar to the one shown here:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_45.jpg"/></div><p>Then, we will add the devices for the provisioning profile we created, for which this profile will be <a class="indexterm" id="id506"/>available. Then, click on <strong>Continue</strong>. The selection screen should look similar to the one in the following screenshot. Check all the devices you want to run your app on.</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_46.jpg"/></div><p>Your profile will be created successfully after this process. Now, it's time to create the distribution profile, which <a class="indexterm" id="id507"/>will be used to deploy your apps on the App Store. To create the distribution profile, click on the same <strong>+</strong> button in the <strong>Provisioning Profiles</strong> menu in the left-hand panel.</p><p>Now, check the settings for the page, as shown here:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_47.jpg"/></div><p>To create the distribution profile, we will select <strong>App Store</strong> from the <strong>Distribution</strong> section. Now, click on <strong>Continue</strong> and, on the next page, select the app ID that we created in the previous section. This distribution profile will be bound to that specific selected app ID.</p><p>Now, on the next page, select <a class="indexterm" id="id508"/><strong>Certificate</strong> and click on <strong>Continue</strong>.</p><p>This will make you land on the next page, which will ask for the name of the provisioning profile. Just provide a name for your distribution profile and click on <strong>Generate</strong>, as shown in the next screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_48.jpg"/></div><p>Now, your distribution profile is ready to deploy the apps on the App Store. It's time to link your provisioning profiles and certificate to Xcode. So, open Xcode and go to <strong>File</strong> | <strong>Preferences</strong>.</p><p>Then, click on the account <a class="indexterm" id="id509"/>that we added in the previous sections of this chapter. Click on the <strong>View Details...</strong> button, as shown here:</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_49.jpg"/></div><p>Now, you can see all the <a class="indexterm" id="id510"/>provisioning profiles and certificates that we have created in previous sections, in the list (as shown here):</p><div><img alt="Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles" src="img/1829OT_07_50.jpg"/></div><p>Now, you can test your development provisioning profile by running your app on the device that we have added in the portal. Just connect the device to your system and select it from Xcode once it is <a class="indexterm" id="id511"/>detected. Now, you can run your app on the device by clicking on the <strong>Play</strong> button on Xcode.</p><p>Awesome! So, we have all that we need to release the app. Now, open your iTunes Connect account and accept all the contacts to start up with the account. It will also ask you for the bank details in to which you want to transfer your profits.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec51"/>Submitting the app</h2></div></div></div><p>You need to <a class="indexterm" id="id512"/>get the following items in order to submit your app. We need to make sure that we have all of them before we get started:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The app's name</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The app's description</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The app's icon, sized 512px by 512px</li></ul></div><p>You will need at least one screenshot of the app. The size of the screenshot should be 640 × 920 (retina, no status bar); 640 × 960 (retina); or for landscape, 960 × 640 (retina).</p><p>We need to assemble all this and then click on <strong>Manage Your Application</strong> in iTunes Connect. Now, click on <a class="indexterm" id="id513"/>the <strong>+</strong> button in iTunes Connect and the resulting screen is as follows:</p><div><img alt="Submitting the app" src="img/1829OT_07_51.jpg"/></div><p>Fill in all the required fields of the app as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Submitting the app" src="img/1829OT_07_52.jpg"/></div><p>Select the bundle ID that we created for our app and, similarly, fill in all the required fields. Once you have clicked on <strong>Create</strong>, you will be taken to the next page (as shown in the following screenshot) <a class="indexterm" id="id514"/>and asked for more information on the app; this information includes screenshots, videos (if any), a description of your app, and category-related information about your app.</p><div><img alt="Submitting the app" src="img/1829OT_07_53.jpg"/></div><p>You can select and update the details in all the tabs shown in the preceding screenshot and click on <strong>Save</strong> once <a class="indexterm" id="id515"/>the complete information is provided.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec52"/>Submitting with Xcode</h2></div></div></div><p>Now, it's time to <a class="indexterm" id="id516"/>submit the app using Xcode, so open Xcode and go to <strong>Product</strong> | <strong>Archive</strong>.</p><p>Once the archive is finished, click on <strong>Validate</strong>. This will check the validation of your binary and list all the issues, if any; otherwise, it will say that validation was successful.
