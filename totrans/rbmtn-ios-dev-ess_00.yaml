- en: With the arrival of the iOS family of devices, the direction of software development
    has radically changed. Today people are spending considerable amounts of time
    on smart devices instead of PCs, which is generating an unprecedented amount of
    revenue that no industry has ever seen. Despite this, it still fits in your pocket.

- en: So far the application development scene for the iOS ecosystem has been dominated
    by Objective-C. However, with the introduction of the revolutionary RubyMotion
    tool chain, Ruby developers are no longer outcasts for creating pure native iOS
    applications. They can make use of every bit of the all-powerful iOS SDK; and
    the best part is this can be done without using Xcode.

- en: Both Ruby and RubyMotion are the brainchild of folks who wanted to simplify
    things in a complex world. *Yukihiro Matsumoto* (also known as *Matz*) is credited
    for creating the Ruby programming language, which is often regarded as a developer's
    best friend. And *Laurent Sansonetti* is credited for creating the ground-breaking
    tool chain, RubyMotion.
