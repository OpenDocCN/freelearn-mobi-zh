			<p class="calibre3">Up to this point, we have discussed choosing our desired workplace and learned what the hiring process looks like. Now, I want to drill down a little about something not many developers pay attention to: developer branding.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Developer branding<a id="_idIndexMarker122" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> refers to the way software developers present themselves and their work to the public. It can include elements such as a personal website, social media presence, and contributions to open source projects.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">Understanding the importance of developing a brand</li>
				<li class="calibre11">Contributing to the community</li>
				<li class="calibre11">Writing content</li>
				<li class="calibre11">Combining all and more</li>
				<li class="calibre11">Understanding that every in-person interaction is important</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">By the end of the chapter, we will have the tools to start building our personal developer brand. First, let’s understand why it matters to our primary goal: passing the iOS interview.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56" class="calibre5">Understanding<a id="_idTextAnchor071" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> the importance of developing a brand</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">This book talks about iOS interviews, but that doesn’t mean it teaches us iOS development. Why? Because I assume that we already know iOS development; the problem is not our skill level but our ability to pass the hiring process.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">But passing an iOS interview is more complicated than we think. It combines our iOS development knowledge, which needs to be comprehensive and extensive, and our familiarity with the hiring process. But there’s a new factor that can help us get our interview and the offer – and that’s our name, or in other <a id="_idIndexMarker123" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>words, our <em class="italic">brand</em>.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s dive into the meaning of a “brand”.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor072" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Learning what a brand is</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">When we think of a<a id="_idIndexMarker124" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> brand, we usually imagine Apple, Google, or Coca Cola and we’re right! A brand is a product or service publicly distinguished from others. The product or the company achieves that by building a reputation, specializing in specific areas, and connecting feelings and thoughts to its name.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">But – did you know that branding is not only for companies? In fact, it’s even not only for businesses. <em class="italic">We, as iOS developers, can build a brand and reputation of </em><em class="italic">our own</em>.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">But what does a “brand” mean? Are we a product?</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In the modern labor market of iOS developers, we are considered to be products, and we need to sell and market ourselves just like any product. We also must brand ourselves to create demand, just like in any marketing process.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Usually, when we think of a brand, we imagine specific colors, fonts, or a unique logo. And that’s true – these are all visual representations of a brand. But this visual representation goes on top of a deeper layer underneath, and that layer contains much more than that. It includes values, history, contribution, quality, and specializations.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The Apple brand makes us imagine a superior user interface, a premium feel, and the “it just works” slogan. The Coca-Cola brand makes us imagine parties and freedom. If you spend more time thinking about it, you’ll find this is true for more brands.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">And you know what? That’s where the concept of a “brand” meets us. Our goal is to bind specific attributes that set us apart from our name in the market of iOS developers. Once we do that, it can leverage our chances in the interview process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor073" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Increasing our chances of passing the resume scanning</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">A strong brand can help us get<a id="_idIndexMarker125" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> an interview. Do you remember <a id="_idIndexMarker126" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>the <strong class="bold">profile scanning</strong> process we discussed in <a href="B18653_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>? That’s where our developer’s name comes in handy. If we maintain our name and build it, chances are that the recruiter would be familiar with it. Bear in mind the <em class="italic">six to eight</em> seconds we’ve got for a first impression, and we can understand the importance of our reputation at this stage.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Imagine going over a list of candidates and suddenly encountering a familiar name. In most cases, it will catch your eye, and you will spend more than the usual eight seconds reading their resume. So yes, the more time spent on our profile, the more chances we’ll get an invitation for <a id="_idIndexMarker127" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>a <strong class="bold">screening interview</strong>. This is how it works. And that also applies, of course, to the interview process itself up until the offer.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor074" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Increasing our chances of getting an offer</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Our brand influence doesn’t stop with getting an interview. It also helps us with the hiring process itself. During the hiring process, our name is part of the recruiting team’s internal discussions, and if we have a strong name, these discussions look different. Any way we look at it, it increases our chances of moving to the next stage in the process (or even skip several stages!) and getting an offer at last.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">On the other hand, the fact that we have a strong presence doesn’t mean we shouldn’t stay modest with a low profile. And that has nothing to do with branding or our skill. It is all about our personality and being a pleasant person to work with or be connected to.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Talking about connections leads us to my next point: networking.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor075" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Expanding our network</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">One of the side effects of<a id="_idIndexMarker128" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> strengthening our name is the <em class="italic">expansion of our professional network</em>. You know, some people don’t care about networking, either because they are not social in their personality or just want to focus on the job and nothing more. That is legit! But if we want to build a strong brand, our network is part of the bundle.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Networking means going to conferences and meetups. But it also implies participating in social media discussions and constantly creating content. These are all part of branding development, and that’s why it goes hand in hand.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Now that we are (hopefully) convinced how important branding is, let’s understand how to build it.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">So, where do we start?</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor076" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>How to start building your brand</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The first and perhaps the primary rule is <em class="italic">focusing on what represents us as developers</em>. If we feel that being on a stage is not our style, we should find another lane. If writing <strong class="bold">blog posts</strong> makes us nervous and itchy, we might consider going in the <strong class="bold">open source</strong> direction. If we are not comfortable with what we’re doing, the chances we will last in the area are pretty<a id="_idTextAnchor077" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> low.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Building our name requires persistence and hard work. Without motivation and enjoyment, it will be difficult to achieve our<a id="_idTextAnchor078" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> goal.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Having said that, the<a id="_idIndexMarker129" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> second rule is that we <em class="italic">mustn’t stay in our comfort zone</em>. It may sound contradictory to the first rule, but I haven’t promised you a straightforward method. After all, life is complex.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, I will list some ideas of how we can develop our name, and I encourage you to at least <em class="italic">consider them as an option</em>. Experiencing them will be the best option.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s start with the basics: contributing to the community, and by that, to yourself.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-62" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor079" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Contributing to the community</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">I know that “contributing” sounds like a heavy task, but this field is so vast that you can also find your niche here. Contributing <a id="_idIndexMarker130" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>means not just participating in a project, but also helping other developers or sharing your achievements in coding.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">One good thing about a<a id="_idIndexMarker131" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> contribution is the ability to share your solutions in the most practical way, which is <em class="italic">coding</em>.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We don’t need to come up with a new way to contribute, as there are many resources available to help us. In today’s age, there are numerous websites that host a large number of developers who share code, ask questions, and exchange ideas. One such website that you may be familiar with<a id="_idIndexMarker132" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> is <strong class="bold">Stack Overflow</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor080" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Being a star in Stack Overflow</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">I’m not sure this book is the place to talk <a id="_idIndexMarker133" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>about what the <strong class="bold">Stack Overflow</strong> website is. But if you are unfamiliar with Stack Overflow, you probably haven’t been living on Earth in the past 15 years, so passing an iOS interview is the least of your problems.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">But the big question is – what is your presence in Stack Overflow? Stack Overflow has four types of users:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">The first is the <em class="italic">passive reader</em>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker134" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> most developers conform to. In most cases, you are one of them. The passive reader reaches Stack Overflow by a search for a question in Google, but they never ask or answer a question because they are, well, passive.</li>
				<li class="calibre11">The second profile is the <em class="italic">Asker</em>. The asker<a id="_idIndexMarker135" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> likes to ask questions but never answers or comments. As weird as it sounds, asking questions provides us with a rating, but more importantly, it exposes us to the community and opens new communication channels with other developers. The most important about asking a question is to do it right – duplicate questions will be removed or marked as spam. Also, we need to provide all details and code snippets and mark the correct tags.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"> To provide answers, we must actively enter Stack Overflow and search for questions or add comments. That is an entirely different use case for the site and leads us to the next us<a id="_idTextAnchor081" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>er type.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">The <em class="italic">respondent</em> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker136" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>user type that bumps into a question and knows the solution, so they answer it. They don’t spend much time on the website but invest minimum effort to contribute. If we want to build our brand, we should be at least a respondent in <a id="_idIndexMarker137" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Stack Overflow.</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">The last type is the <em class="italic">heavy contributor</em>. They enter<a id="_idIndexMarker138" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> Stack Overflow daily and search for questions to answer. This is a different type of user – they like to phrase solutions to complex problems, publish code snippets, and conduct discussions about best practices and mythology. It’s an excellent way to start our workday while going over questions in Stack Overflow, filtered by tags <a id="_idIndexMarker139" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>such<a id="_idIndexMarker140" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> as <strong class="bold">iOS</strong>, <strong class="bold">Swift</strong>, or <strong class="bold">UIKit</strong>. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker141" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>not an impossible mission to answer questions in Stack Overflow and gain a high reputation; it is just a matter of priorities and effort.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Another lighter way to contribute is to comment on answers and questions. We use comments when we need clarifications, criticize a provided solution, or improve an answer or a question. These options open many new ways to be part of the discussions even though we don’t have the perfect answer to the question.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">I mentioned all these types because to be a star, we should aim to be the fourth type. If we want to build our brand, contributing to the community using Stack Overflow is a great way to do that.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Once we get more ratings and experience in Stack Overflow, we can start contributing in new ways, such as editing questions or answers, flag questions, and even deleting them.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Contributing to <a id="_idIndexMarker142" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Stack Overflow is a <em class="italic">win-win strategy</em> – you get to learn so much while getting noticed in the community.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor082" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Maintaining a public GitHub repository</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">We had long <a id="_idIndexMarker143" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>discussions about having a great resume in <a href="B18653_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>. And while having a good resume is essential, we can<a id="_idIndexMarker144" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> complete our image as developers with an impressive <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong> repository. For example, when <a id="_idIndexMarker145" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>we talk about an architect, we expect to see his work. The same goes for a designer or a photographer. Why does it need to be a different case with <strong class="bold">iOS</strong> developers?</p>
			<p class="calibre3">A GitHub repository is our code portfolio, our way to show what we are capable of. Pushing new updates, ideas, and libraries using social media can significantly influence how we look as iOS developers.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The big problem is – what do we need to put on <a id="_idIndexMarker146" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>our <strong class="bold">public Git repository</strong>? We can’t put our current project from work on it, can we?</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s break it down.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Sharing solutions using Swift Package or pods</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">We are<a id="_idIndexMarker147" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> iOS developers, and we’re good! It means that we’ve solved dozens, if not hundreds, of complex issues during our careers. Most likely, we are not the first that have encountered them. What if (just an idea, right?) we take one or some of our solutions and <em class="italic">share them with </em><em class="italic">the world</em>?</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s try to remember – did we have something unique that we were proud of? Did we build something in a way that can be used in a different project easily? If this is the case, we should create a public repository in our <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong> account and share it. The simplest way is using a <strong class="bold">Swift Package</strong> or a <strong class="bold">pod</strong>.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Creating a side project</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Another <a id="_idIndexMarker148" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>option for a GitHub repository is creating a side project. Side projects allow us to show our code portfolio, how we build a project from scratch, and maintain it over time. Maintainance is one of the primary challenges with side projects. Here are some tips for maintaining our side project:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">Many developers have ideas for side projects. Starting one is easy: set up a new repository, create a new project, and write some classes. The primary problem, well... is to finish these projects. And that’s the first tip with a side project. It is better to start a <em class="italic">modest</em> project but one that is practical to work on than an ambitious one that we never get to finish.</li>
				<li class="calibre11">Another thing to focus on is its <em class="italic">architecture rather than its functionality</em>. I’m not saying that our side project doesn’t need to function well, but we should remember its goal, and that’s showing what we can. If that’s the case, it needs to look good. Clean design patterns, good naming conventions, and single-responsibility principles are much more important than fixing one more bug.</li>
				<li class="calibre11">The third tip is our <em class="italic">time management</em>. I know what it’s like to find a slot in our busy schedule to work on a side project. But do the math – 10 minutes a day sums up to five hours a month and 30 hours in half a year. We don’t have to quit our job or spend endless nights on a side project. We just need to manage our time better and have a long-term plan with realistic milestones.</li>
				<li class="calibre11">My last tip talks about <em class="italic">priorities in our work</em>. Trying to nail every minor issue that we bump into and striving for perfection won’t bring us to our goal and will just frustrate us. It is better to continually progress and leave leftover to-dos than be stuck on a non-issue. Remember that finishing a side project is much more <a id="_idIndexMarker149" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>important than making it perfect, especially from a mental point of view.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Now, a side project is a big deal for some of us. We need ideas, ambition, and time. But we don’t have to go that far, as there are other ways to show what we can.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">Adding gists and showcase projects</h3>
			<pre>binary tree search</strong> (<strong class="bold">BTS</strong>) algorithm<a id="_idIndexMarker151" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> works in <strong class="bold">Swift</strong>, we can<a id="_idIndexMarker152" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> build a small app that uses that algorithm. But for that, we don’t even need a project to show a piece of code. We can use a GitHub feature <a id="_idIndexMarker153" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>called <strong class="bold">Gist</strong>.</pre>
			<p class="callout-heading">What is a binary tree search?</p>
			<p class="callout">A binary tree search is a data<a id="_idIndexMarker154" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> structure consisting of nodes arranged in a hierarchical order, where each node has at most two children. It allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of nodes by leveraging the property that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. Although binary tree search isn’t in the scope of this chapter, this is a good opportunity to learn about it, implement it in Swift, and create a nice gist to share with the world.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">A gist is a GitHub feature that allows us to <a id="_idIndexMarker155" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>share code snippets. Do we need to show how to use a <strong class="bold">regular expression</strong> to match <a id="_idIndexMarker156" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>an email address form? Great! A gist is perfect for that.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Remember that by writing code daily we perform innovative and sophisticated tasks. So, let’s take these ideas and create meaningful content. Once we have a lead for a <a id="_idTextAnchor083" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>written code snippet or a project, it is essential to add gists correctly. Like everything in life, focusing is the key to success.</p>
			<h3 class="calibre9">How to focus on what matters</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s start with the obvious – this chapter is not a GitHub tutorial, and this book doesn’t explain how to develop an app to solve Swift algorithm problems. The main goal is to help you get an interview and pass it like a king. Having said that, we now understand how important it is to strive for a good-looking GitHub account.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">As I said earlier, if our goal is branding, there’s a significant weight to how our GitHub looks like. Let’s break down what that means.</p>
			<h4 class="calibre16">Making our README file look more interesting</h4>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s go back again to the resume scanning in the <em class="italic">Building our resume</em> section of <a href="B18653_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a> – remember that issue? We know that we have six to eight seconds for the recruiter to scan our portfolio and decide whether they keep on reading or move it to the trash. This six-to-eight-second rule also applies to code documentation scanning; not just resumes.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Every <a id="_idIndexMarker157" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>GitHub repository has a <strong class="bold">README</strong> file, which appears when you enter the repository on the web. Usually, it contains installation and usage instructions, but it always starts with explaining the project.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">That explanation allows us to market our project and make it more interesting. Just like our personal summary description, we don’t start with what the code does but rather what problem it solves and why that problem is crucial.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Another way to make our project looks more attractive is by adding images or even a GIF animation (depending on the project type). Adding artwork catches the eye and makes the scanning more effective.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Now that we have an excellent README file, let’s move to the main course: the code, which must be readable.</p>
			<h4 class="calibre16">Writing readable code</h4>
			<pre>gist</strong>, we must ensure it looks perfect.</pre>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s list some tips for a readable code:</p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11">Adding explicit <em class="italic">comments</em> that explain the reasons for our choices</li>
				<li class="calibre11">Choosing good <em class="italic">naming conventions</em> for classes and variables</li>
				<li class="calibre11">Using <em class="italic">design patterns</em> correctly and by the book (unless the book is ours, of course)</li>
				<li class="calibre11">Writing <strong class="bold">unit tests</strong> that describe what the code does and its expectations</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">These are some of the ways to make our code shine!</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Remember that the developer who will review our code will not be the recruiter, but the hiring manager or the team tech lead. They know a thing or two about iOS development, so our code needs to look perfect and complete.</p>
			<h4 class="calibre16">Completeness of our project</h4>
			<p class="calibre3">What about finishing our project before we make it public? That’s an important point. Don’t leave half-baked projects or even code snippets. It is better to finish a small project than to plan and not finish a big one. We discussed that previously, but when showing it to the world, it gets even more crucial.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">A side project is a big deal. It takes time and effort, but it also gives us <em class="italic">points</em> when we build our brand.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">If we want to work on a project but don’t want to start our own, there’s another way to do that, and maybe that’s more suitable for us.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor085" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Joining an open source project</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">There are many reasons why developers<a id="_idIndexMarker159" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> like contributing to an <strong class="bold">open source</strong> project. One of the top reasons is the <em class="italic">drive to change</em> a product we often use. Another reason is <em class="italic">empowering our skills</em>. We are not here to talk about how open source projects help us as developers but how contributing to an open source helps us build <em class="italic">our brand</em>.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We said earlier that a brand should reflect the developer we are or the style of the developer we want to be.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">An open source project requires different skills (both soft and hard) than a personal side project, and contributing to an open source project brings these skills to the front. So, before we <strong class="bold">fork</strong> a Git repository and add new code, we must confirm that this work fits our personality.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Previously, I said that the most critical thing about building our brand is to make sure that whatever way we choose is suitable for us and the image we want to create. Enjoyment and fun play a significant role here! And contributing to an open source project can be frustrating at first. We must dive into an existing project, handle intensive communi<a id="_idTextAnchor086" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>cation with other developers, and get used to cruel pull requests rejected with insulting comments. Is this what we imagined when we planned on joining an open source <a id="_idIndexMarker160" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>project?</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Many developers want to share their knowledge and lessons learned with the world, but open source projects don’t always fit their skill set. Fortunately, there is another way of achieving that: writing.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor087" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Writing content</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">Another way of building a <a id="_idIndexMarker161" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>brand is content <a id="_idIndexMarker162" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>writing. <strong class="bold">Blogs</strong>, tutorials, or even books are all great examples of content writing that can leverage our developer brand.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The reason it has a significant influence on our brand is apparent, but content writing can help us pass the interview process in other ways as well, and it is considered a win-win solution. Let’s elaborate on that next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor088" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Being experts</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Reading a professional article is excellent for<a id="_idIndexMarker163" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> learning, but writing a professional article is another level of profundity.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Imagine what is required from us when writing an article – research, coding, edge case covering, the ability the explain why things are done the way they are, and managing alternative discussions.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We understand now that writing an article is not really writing – it’s learning! It means being an expert in a specific field and covering it from all angles. The more blog posts we write, the more areas we cover, and that’s a fantastic starting point for our hiring process.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">But knowledge <a id="_idIndexMarker164" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>coverage is not everything. It also provides us the capability to explain that knowledge, which leads us to my next point.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor089" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Improving wording and expression capabilities</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Another skill we get when <a id="_idIndexMarker165" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>writing content is the wording and self-expression ability. Content writing organizes our thoughts coherently, allowing us to list cons and pros, discuss alternatives and explain (for example) why we <a id="_idIndexMarker166" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>need to force wrap an <strong class="bold">IBOutlet</strong> and not make it optional.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The <strong class="bold">self-expression capability</strong> is crucial in<a id="_idIndexMarker167" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> interviews. Starting from the next chapter, we will learn how to answer questions, but mostly, we will learn that there are many questions without clear answers. In these cases, our ability to discuss or even debate these questions is essential.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Writing content creates discussions not only in interviews but also as a reaction to the blog post itself. So, here’s another benefit we have! Connections!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor090" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Increasing our network</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">Remember when I said content writing is a “win-win” effort? Now, we see that it’s a gift that never stops giving.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">After we <a id="_idIndexMarker168" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>publish our post, we will start getting responses from iOS developers worldwide. Each answer is a lead for a discussion thread, and that thread creates a new connection.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Also, each blog post brings new followers, which in turn adds more questions and creates new connections, so that process is even exponential!</p>
			<p class="calibre3">An extensive network and a high number of followers can help us get our first interview during the interview process. I remember interviewing for a job where the interviewer was one of my followers, and he even used one of my blog posts to solve his problem. That illuminates the interview in a different light, doesn’t it?</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The example I <a id="_idIndexMarker169" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>just gave also brings up another benefit: exposing our knowledge to the world.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70" class="calibre7"><a id="_idTextAnchor091" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Making the world aware of our knowledge</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The mission <a id="_idIndexMarker170" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>of passing an interview is part of a competitive world where we need to “play the game”.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">It’s not enough that we know how smart we are. We need others to see that as well. That may sound superficial, I know. But yes – that’s part of building a brand and marketing ourselves and our capabilities.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">The fourth benefit of sharing our knowledge is <em class="italic">exposing to the world what we know</em>, how we think, and our abilities to perform research in new and exciting fields. When we think of it, managing a blog or having our own book opens a window to our knowledge, our mi<a id="_idTextAnchor092" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>ndset, and our way of thinking. This might sound creepy initially, but it can significantly benefit applying for a job posting when we do it right.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s think about it for a second – our first and perhaps most challenging goal is passing the resume scanning stage, which we can only do if the reviewer thinks we are suitable for the role. For some reviewers, the fact that we have our iOS development knowledge laid bare acts as a certificate of what we are capable of. It’s a huge benefit, especially if the reviewer is also the hiring manager.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">So, we can see we have several advantages of content writing, and it’s practically a win-win situation. But how does it fit with other ways we discussed earlier? We will see that in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor093" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Combining all and more</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">You know, writing content is excellent and valuable to our brand development effort. But the real power comes when we use the content as an infrastructure for our brand and combine it with the other methods we mentioned, such as being active in GitHub and Stack Overflow.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">For example, if we write an article about a specific topic, we can <em class="italic">build upon it</em>. A GitHub repository explains our central idea, and by doing so, we earn another way to share our skills. We can then use our repository or article as a reference when answering a question in Stack Overflow and gain even more exposure.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">But what can really make a big difference is upgrading that package to the extreme. Two great options that can make us stand out are <em class="italic">speaking at conferences</em> and <em class="italic">authoring a book</em>. I didn’t mention them before because, unlike the other options, being a public speaker or writing a book requires special skills, time, and resources.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Dreaming about standing on a stage or seeing our book on Amazon is thrilling and exciting. These two options can leverage our brand to new highs and open new doors in the industry.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Before we summarize the chapter, I want to take us back to the ground and talk about the basics of the basics: in-person interactions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-72" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor094" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Understanding that every in-person interaction is important</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">In <a href="B18653_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, we discussed how<a id="_idIndexMarker171" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/> important it is to leave a good impression in interviews. But the discussion was in the context of getting hired. We should remember that impressing people in person is not just essential for interviews, but also for creating our brand.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Open source contributions, Stack Overflow questions, blog followers, and more are all examples of places where we are <em class="italic">required to handle a certain number of interactions</em> with other developers.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">Looking forward, these interactions also help us to shape our image in the industry. Sometimes, that single interaction is the only chance we’ve got to show who we are to other developers.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">What is the impression that we leave behind? Like every industrial product, our name goes in front of us and is built upon thousands of talks, help sessions, and correspondences.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor095" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">We just covered an exciting and unique topic! Developer branding is way beyond just Swift and UIKit practicing – it can also help us in our development career. But what’s more interesting is that its scope is very flexible. We can start with just a code snippet in Gist and move up until we’re speaking in public and writing books. We can choose where we want to be according to our resources and skills.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">We’ve learned what a brand is, why contributing is part of it, how to maintain a GitHub repository, be a star in Stack Overflow, and produce our professional content.</p>
			<p class="calibre3">By now, we should have the essential tools to start our branding development plan toward becoming a rising star in the iOS development community!</p>
			<p class="calibre3">But one thing is missing: our ability to successfully pass the technical interview… (after all, this is why we are all here, right?). Fortunately, in our next chapter, we will discuss something we all enjoyed learning – Swift language and coding. The fun is just beginning.</p>
