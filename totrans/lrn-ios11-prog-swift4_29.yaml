    to build an entire app. This process would not be complete, however, without actually
    learning how to submit the app to the App Store. This process may seem like a
    lot when doing it for the first time, but it becomes easier and even second nature
    after a while.

- en: When I submitted my first app, I was extremely nervous. I remember the relief
    I felt after submitting the app, but I was soon repeatedly checking the site and
    my inbox for that approval email. I'd heard many stories of people who spent a
    lot of time working on an app only to have it rejected; these fears are understandable,
    but know that Apple wants you to succeed. Even if your app gets rejected (and
    my first one did), it's not necessarily a bad thing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My first app was a sports app, and it was rejected for two reasons. First, in
    Apple's eyes, the logo for my app was too similar to the NFL logo. To address
    this, I simply made a generic logo with the initials of the app. Second, the quality
    of my images was considered not up to standard; therefore, I obtained better images.
    I then resubmitted my app, and within a couple of days my app was approved. It
    is almost a certainty that you will encounter rejections, even if you have been
    doing this for a while. Take comfort in the fact that you can address any issues
    with your app and resubmit it for approval from the App Store.

    app into the App Store. In Xcode 9, a lot of things are done for you behind the
    scenes; however, the goal of this chapter is to show you how you can set up things
    on your own. You will need a developer account in order to follow along with these
    steps. Go to [https://developer.apple.com/programs/](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)

    is either approved or rejected. If rejected, once you have fixed the issues, you
    can resubmit it in the same manner by updating the archive and following the steps
    laid out previously.

- en: At this point, all you can do is wait for Apple to review your project. The
    next week or so will be the most nerve-wracking (at least it was for me). Don't
    worry if your app gets rejected, because it happens to the most experienced of
    developers and is often fixable. Apps can be rejected for minor reasons that are
    easy to fix; however, you do not want to work for months on a project and miss
    something big that Apple will never approve. So, do your research as to what is
    and is not acceptable to Apple. When you submit your apps to the App Store, please
    reach out to me on Twitter (`@thedevme`) to let me know—I would love to see what
    you have built.
