    to your application before releasing it to the Play Store. The recipes in this
    chapter cover the topics that can make a difference between users keeping your
    app or removing it.

- en: Our first recipe, *The Android 6.0 Runtime permission model*, is certainly an
    important topic, possibly being the primary reason Android went from version 5.x
    to version 6! Changes to the Android permission model have been requested for
    some time, so this new model is a welcome change, at least for users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we'll take a look at alarms in *How to schedule an alarm*. One of the
    primary benefits of alarms is that the OS is responsible for maintaining the alarm,
    even when your application is not running. Since alarms do not persist after rebooting
    the device, we'll also look at how to detect a device reboot so you can recreate
    your alarms in *Receiving notification of device boot*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost any serious Android application will need a way to perform potentially
    blocking tasks off the main thread. Otherwise, your app runs the risk of being
    perceived as sluggish, or worse, completely unresponsive. `AsyncTask` was designed
    to make it easier to create a background worker task, as we'll demonstrate in
    the *Using AsyncTask for background work* recipe.

    take a look at the *Adding speech recognition to your app* recipe, in which we'll
    explore the Google Speech API.

    comfortable and encourage users to log in with the *How to add Google sign-in

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The old security model was a sore point for many in Android. It's common to
    see reviews commenting on the permissions an app requires. Sometimes, permissions
    were unrealistic (such as a Flashlight app requiring internet permission), but
    other times, the developer had good reasons to request certain permissions. The
    main problem was that it was an all-or-nothing prospect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This finally changed with the Android 6 Marshmallow (API 23) release. The new
    permission model still declares permissions in the manifest as before, but users
    have the option of selectively accepting or denying each permission. Users can
    even revoke a previously granted permission.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although this is a welcome change for many, for a developer, it has the potential
    to break the code that was working before. We've talked about this permission
    change in the previous recipes, as it has far-reaching implications. This recipe
    will put it all together to serve as a single point of reference when implementing
    this change in your own apps.

    on the Play Store. If you haven't already updated your app, apps not updated will
    be removed by the end of the year (2018).

- en: This is a very simple example of an `AsyncTask` just to show it working. Technically,
    only `doInBackground()` is required, but usually, you want to receive notifications when
    it finishes, which is done via `onPostExecute()` .
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An `AsyncTask` works by creating a worker thread for the `doInBackground()`
    method, then responds on the UI thread in the `onPostExecute()` callback. Our
    example uses the Thread.Sleep() method to put the thread to sleep for the specified
    time (1000 milliseconds in our example). Since we call CountingTask with the value
    10, the background task is going to take 10 seconds. This example illustrates
    that in fact the task is executing in the background since otherwise, Android
    would display the ANR dialog after 5 seconds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also important to note how we waited until `onPostExecute()` is called
    before we do any UI actions (such as enabling the button in our example.) If we
    attempt to modify the UI in the worker thread, the code would either not compile
    or throw a runtime exception. You should also note how we instantiated a new `CountingTask`
    object on each button click. This is because an `AsyncTask` can only execute once.
    Attempting to call execute again will also throw an exception.

- en: At its minimum, the `AsyncTask` can be very simple but it is still very flexible
    with more options available if you need them. When using an `AsyncTask` with an
    Activity, it's important to understand when the Activity is destroyed and recreated
    (such as during an orientation change), the `AsyncTask` continues to run. This
    can leave your `AsyncTask` orphaned and it might respond to the now destroyed
    activity (causing a `NullPointer` exception). For this reason, it's common to
    use the `AysncTask` with a Fragment (which is not destroyed on screen rotation).

    `onCreate()`. If at least one activity is registered to handle the `RecognizerIntent.ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH`
    intent, then we know it's available. If no activities are available, we display
    a Toast indicating speech recognition is not available and disable the mic button.
