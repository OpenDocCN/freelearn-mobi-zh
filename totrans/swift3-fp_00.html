<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref07"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>Functional programming (FP) is getting a lot of attention as it eases many of the difficulties faced in object-oriented programming (OOP), such as testability, maintainability, scalability, and concurrency. Swift has a lot of functional programming features that can be easily used, but most Objective-C and Swift programmers are not familiar with these tools.</p><p>This book aims to simplify the functional programming paradigms and make it easily usable for Swift programmers, showing you how to use popular functional programming techniques to solve many of your day-to-day development problems. Whether you are new to functional programming and Swift or experienced, this book will provide you with the skills you need to design and develop high quality, easily maintainable, scalable, and efficient applications for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Through this book, you'll learn to build bug-free, maintainable code using functional programming.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with Functional Programming in Swift">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Functional Programming in Swift</em></span>, introduces functional programming paradigms, such as immutability, stateless programming, pure, first-class, and higher-order functions. This chapter will provide an introduction to the Swift programming language and functional programming paradigms in Swift.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Functions and Closures">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Functions and Closures</em></span>, begins with a definition of functions, continues with other related topics, such as function types and tuples, and finally concludes with more advanced topics such as first-class functions, higher-order functions, function composition, closures, currying, recursion, and memoization.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Types and Type casting">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Types and Type casting</em></span>, takes a look at types in general and explores reference versus value types in detail. We will cover topics such as value and reference type constants, mixing value and reference types, and copying. Then we will discuss the characteristics of value types. We will also cover the key differences between value and reference types, and how we should decide which one to use. We will continue by exploring equality, identity, type checking, and casting topics.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Enumerations and Pattern Matching">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Enumerations and Pattern Matching</em></span>, explains the enumeration definition and usage. We will cover associated and raw values and introduce the concept of algebraic data types. We will explore some examples to cover the sum, product, and recursion types. Also, in this chapter, we will explore patterns such as wildcard, value-binding, identifier, tuple, enumeration case, optional, type casting, and expression, along with related pattern matching examples.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Generics and Associated Type Protocols">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Generics and Associated Type Protocols</em></span>, teaches us how to define and use generics. We will also understand the type of problems generics solve. Moving forward, we will explore type constraints, generic data structures, and associated type protocols with examples.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Map, Filter, and Reduce">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Map, Filter, and Reduce</em></span>, introduces the map, filter, and reduce methods in the Swift programming language with appropriate examples. These methods are used on arrays and can replace almost all uses of for-in loops and are more clear and concise.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Dealing with Optionals">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Dealing with Optionals</em></span>, familiarizes us with different techniques to deal with optionals. We will talk about built-in techniques to deal with optionals, such as optional binding, guard, coalescing, and optional chaining. Then we will explore functional programming techniques to deal with optionals.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Functional Data Structures">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Functional Data Structures</em></span>, introduces you to the concept of functional data structures and explores examples of data structures implemented in functional way, such as Semigroup, Monoid, BST, LinkedList, Stack, and LazyList.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Importance of Immutability">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Importance of Immutability</em></span>, explores the concept of immutability. We will look at its importance and benefits with the help of examples. Then we will look into cases for mutability and go through an example to compare mutability and immutability effects on our code.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. The Best of Both Worlds – Combining FP Paradigms with OOP">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Best of Both Worlds – Combining FP Paradigms with OOP</em></span>, covers object-oriented programming principles and paradigms. Then we will be introduced to protocol-oriented programming. Next, we will have an introduction of functional reactive programming and explore how to mix FP with OOP paradigms.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Case Study – Developing an iOS Application with the FP and OOP Paradigms">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Case Study – Developing an iOS Application with the FP and OOP Paradigms</em></span>, teaches us to develop a Todo backend and an iOS application, employing the concepts we have discussed so far. We will use functional programming techniques to parse and map the data, we will use functional reactive programming to reactively manage events in applications. We will also employ protocol-oriented programming and object-oriented programming techniques as well.</p></div></div>
