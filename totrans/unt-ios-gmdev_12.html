While most people equate marketing with advertising, marketing encompasses market analysis, value proposition, product differentiation, market strategies, and so on. While we don't need all of this in order to build our game, we need to examine portions of marketing to determine what is the best way to bring it to market and make money from all our hard work. Should we charge 99 cents, should we give it away and depend on advertising, or should we try to license the game to a third party? These are all questions that this chapter will help us answer.</p></blockquote></div><p>In this chapter we shall discuss:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to add iAds to a product</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to add In-App purchases</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to publish content to the Unity Asset Store</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to publish the final version of our product</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to track success with iTunes Connect</li></ul></div><p>This is our final step to putting out a quality application that generates revenue and produces happy customers — our number one priority.</p><p>So let's get on with it...</p><div class="section" title="Business model generation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec01"/>Business model generation</h1></div></div></div><p>At the time of writing there are over 200 million iOS devices in the hands of consumers, nearly 15 billion downloads of applications from the App Store, with over 2.5 billion dollars being paid to developers in App Store sales. While this alone would have the average developer salivating, one must also consider that there are over 300,000 applications in the App Store with a growth rate of 11,000 — 15,000 applications per month. As such, one cannot depend on simply shipping a title and expecting it to make money. You will need an approach for how to target customers, get your app on their device and extract money from them — and that approach is commonly referred to as a business model.</p><p>While normally one would discuss this as the first topic when planning to build a revenue generating venture, most people's eyes would glaze over in the first chapter and they'd put the book back on the shelf.<a id="id532" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>As the Apple App Store ecosystem has developed, four successful business models have emerged as viable ways to capitalize on your creation: pure app sales, advertising, In-App purchases, and marketplace component sales.</p><div class="section" title="Pure app sales"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec01"/>Pure app sales</h2></div></div></div><p>This is the traditional approach to publishing applications on the App Store. You produce an application, set a price based on some pricing strategy, and then release it to the App Store and wait for customers to purchase your application.<a id="id533" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Advertising"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec02"/>Advertising</h2></div></div></div><p>The advertising model is typically used for applications that are distributed for free, though some applications charge money and still include advertisements. Nevertheless, as the game is started or played, the application makes a request to an ad network to include ad content somewhere in the game. As people watch these ads or interact with them, the ad supplier pays the application creator.<a id="id534" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="In-App purchases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec03"/>In-App purchases</h2></div></div></div><p>The In-App purchase model is quickly establishing itself as the business model of choice for mobile applications. There are two models generally used with In-App purchases. In the first model one develops a form of currency and players use that currency to purchase items in the game world. In the second model, developers sell additional weapons, tracks, vehicles, and so on, which are then added to an existing game to enhance the player's experience.<a id="id535" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Marketplace component"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec04"/>Marketplace component</h2></div></div></div><p>While not truly a model for selling a game, selling components on a marketplace is something you can consider if you are building components and prefabs for your game and either decide that they are no longer useful for you, or that you want make some money without publishing an entire game. In addition, if you develop a novel solution to a common development problem, you should sell it on<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gameprefabs.com"> www.gameprefabs.com</a> or within the Unity Asset store itself.<a id="id536" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>There isn't anything preventing you from choosing just one of these business models or implementing all of them in a single product. The only thing you need to do is balance your desire to make money with the end-user experience. So long as you aren't very intrusive into the user playing your game, the model will not annoy the users, but if they begin to feel as if you're fleecing them, you will kill the goose that lays the golden egg.<a id="id537" class="indexterm"/>

<div class="section" title="In-App purchases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec04"/>In-App purchases</h1></div></div></div><p>An In-App purchase within a game provides users with the ability to purchase upgrades, access levels, weapons, or other content by transacting with the App Store. The App Store will then communicate with the game to notify it that a purchase has been authorized and that the content should be unlocked within the game. All of this takes place within the iOS SDK and the App Store commerce systems, so you will not have to deal with credit card transactions or the security of commercial transactions across the wire. Apple will handle the entire process and you will receive money in your account the same way you would with regular application purchases.<a id="id554" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Internally, In-App purchases are accomplished using the iOS SDK Store Kit API. This API is responsible for communicating with the App Store and collecting payments from the user:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0409_12_19.jpg" alt="In-App purchases"/></div><p>To date, Unity does not provide a channel within the iOS version of the Unity product for an application to add In-App purchases to games so, as with iAds, we will have to rely on a third-party plugin to implement this functionality. As before we will use a plugin from Prime31 the StoreKit plugin.<a id="id556" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="section" title="Subscription types"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec07"/>Subscription types</h2></div></div></div><p>There are four different types of In-App purchases: non-consumable, consumable, subscriptions, and auto-renewing subscriptions:<a id="id557" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Non-consumable</strong></span> In-App purchases represent a class of items that you purchase once and have access to continuously. These purchases can be transferred between devices on the same iTunes account. Examples of non-consumable items include game levels, weapons, vehicles, and other permanently available items.<a id="id558" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Consumable</strong></span> In-App purchases represent a class of items that, as the name suggests, are purchased and then consumed by the player requiring an additional purchase each time the player wishes to use the item. Examples of consumable items include experience points, health kits, turbo boosts, ammo packs, and so on.<a id="id559" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Subscriptions</strong></span> are similar to magazine and newspaper subscriptions that last for a limited duration and then require the user to renew after that duration has expired. While not typical in gaming circles, an example of a subscription might be a defensive coach in a football game, which allows the player to not have to call defensive plays. The coach would be available for the duration of the subscription and after it expires the game would require the player to call defensive plays again.<a id="id560" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Auto-renewable subscriptions</strong></span> are those that allow the user to purchase In-App content for a set duration of time. At the end of the duration, the subscription will automatically renew, with iTunes charging the user, unless the user opts out. Examples of the auto-renewable subscriptions are the same as normal subscriptions except that the player continues to have the defensive coach until they cancel the subscription.<a id="id561" class="indexterm"/></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Delivery models"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec08"/>Delivery models</h2></div></div></div><p>In-App purchases can use one of two delivery models with iTunes, the built-in model and the server model.<a id="id562" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>In the built-in product model, everything required for your application to deliver In-App purchases to your customer is built in to your game. This means that all of the consumable and non-consumable In-App purchases are already built into the game. Accordingly, this means that all purchase access would be defined through application identifiers. As an individual application would be responsible for maintaining these preferences they can become lost when a user moves between devices, so you must ensure that any preferences, that would preserve that state are stored in application preferences, as they are backed up by iTunes. Another solution is to use iCloud, or similar, to host these application preferences off of the device:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0409_12_20.jpg" alt="Delivery models"/></div><p>In the server product model a separate server maintains the In-App purchase content as well as the transactions with the App Store. The App Store, application and the server then orchestrate confirming purchases and delivering content to the iOS device. In this model a game would deliver new levels or other content directly to the application. While this model is compelling, at the moment it does not work well with Unity iOS applications, as Apple requires that all of your content be distributed in the application on the App Store. It is included here for completeness:<a id="id563" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0409_12_21.jpg" alt="Delivery models"/></div><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"/>Note</h3><p>As the In-App purchase process does not provide the capability to patch an application, and since Unity will not directly load content that is not in the application bundle, it is expected that all of the content that you plan to deliver through In-App purchases will be delivered in a version of your application in the App Store.</p></div></div></div>

There are a number of steps that you have to perform to get this right, especially if you're a new developer to the iOS platform, so I'm going to take some time to make sure you understand what's going on. iOS development can be very unforgiving if you don't do things the right way, but once you walk through it a few times it becomes second nature.<a id="id581" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>We are going to walk through each of the steps necessary to produce commercial content for Unity3 that can be deployed to an iOS device:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Open the<span class="strong"><strong> iTunes Connect</strong></span> portal at<a class="ulink" href="http://https://itunesconnect.apple.com"> https://itunesconnect.apple.com</a> or launch it from the normal iTunes developer portal:<a id="id582" class="indexterm"/><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0409_12_36.jpg" alt="Time for action — How is our game doing?"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Once in the portal, select the<span class="strong"><strong> Sales and Trends</strong></span> link in the portal links.

In iTunes Connect you can look at the demographics of the purchasers of the game across a number of different dimensions such as time, geography, device, and so on.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec09"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>There is one last challenge for you to accomplish that is more important than anything we've done thus far and that is to actually create and publish your own game. There are lots of reasons why people stop short, but realize that you are now armed with all of the information you need to create a game, publish it, and make money doing it. You may not be able to quit your day job, but if you stick with it you may very well one day create the next great gaming brand or game company.</p><p>Don't worry about creating the next best game in any one particular genre, don't worry about having the latest and best graphics, don't wonder if that gaming idea will sell a million units (I can't imagine the guys who created<span class="emphasis"><em> Angry Birds</em></span> knew it would take off the way it has) — focus on creating SOMETHING, then create something else and, before you know it, you WILL create something great. But you can't do it if you try to create the next<span class="emphasis"><em> Skyrim, World of Warcraft, Call of Duty</em></span>, or<span class="emphasis"><em> Crysis</em></span> as your first project.</p><p>So, rather than say goodbye, I'll say, "See you on the App Store." Good luck and above all else… HAVE FUN!</p></div></body></html>
