    Storage APIs, Automatic Reference Counting, Twitter, and AirPlay integration,
    how to use the various Core Image filters using the Cocoa framework, and the new
    features of the iOS 5 SDK. After this, you'll jump straight in and create applications
    using Xcode and Interface Builder using the new storyboard layout. We then finish
    up by learning how to make your applications run smoothly using the Xcode instruments.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. What''s New in iOS5"), *What''s New in iOS5*,
    introduces the developer to the Xcode developer set of tools, the new features
    of iOS 5, as well as an introduction into Newsstand and the `MessageUI` framework.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Using iCloud and the Storage APIs"), *Using
    iCloud and the Storage APIs*, introduces you to the benefits of using iCloud,
    and how to incorporate iCloud functionality into your applications to store and
    retrieve files, and its data through the use of the storage APIs. This chapter
    will also give you some insight into how to go about handling file-version conflicts
    when multiple copies of the same file are being updated on more than one iOS device.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Debugging with OpenGL ES"), *Debugging with
    OpenGL ES*, focuses on the differences between vertex shaders and fragment shaders,
    and their relationship with one another. We will become familiar with the OpenGL
    ES 2.0 Programmable pipeline, and look into the new debugging features of OpenGL
    ES that enables us to track down issues specific to OpenGL ES, right within the
    Xcode IDE. We will learn more about the OpenGL ES frame capture tool and its ability
    to stop execution of a program, that will enable the developer to grab the current
    frame contents that are being rendered on the iOS device, so that program issues
    can be tracked down and corrected, by taking a closer look at the program state
    information of objects, by scrolling through the debug navigator stack trace with
    the ability to see all of the textures and shaders that are currently being used
    by the application.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Using Storyboards"), *Using Storyboards*,
    gains an understanding of what Storyboards are and how we can apply the various
    transitions between views. We will take a look into how we are able to create
    and configure scenes and storyboard files, to present these programmatically.
    We will also look at how to go about building and integrating Twitter capabilities
    into our application to tweet photos and standard messages.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Using AirPlay and Core Image"), *Using AirPlay
    and Core Image*, focuses on learning about the AirPlay and Core Image frameworks,
    and how we go about using and implementing these into our applications. This chapter
    also explains the different image filter effects, how to adjust the brightness
    of an image, as well as how to go about producing a water ripple effect. It also
    covers how to incorporate AirPlay functionality into your application, so that
    you can have your application displayed out to an external device, such as an
    Apple TV.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Xcode Tools - Improvements"), *Xcode Tools
    - Improvements*, focuses on learning about the improvements that have been made
    to the Xcode development tools. We will take a look at **Automatic Reference Counting**
    (**ARC**), which is the latest addition that has been made to the LLVM compiler,
    and how this can help improve application performance, by minimizing issues with
    our applications. It also covers improvements that have been made to Interface
    Builder, the iOS Location simulator, and the set of debugging tools for OpenGL
    ES.'

    Instruments"), *Making your Applications Run Smoothly Using Instruments*, focuses
    on how we can effectively use Instruments within our applications to track down
    memory leaks and bottlenecks within our applications that could potentially cause
    our application to crash on the user''s iOS device. We will take a look into each
    of the different types of built-in instruments that come as part of the Instruments
    application, learn how we can use the System Trace instrument to monitor system
    calls, and track down performance issues within an application.'

    (Mac OS X 10.6.2, or later). You can use Leopard, but I would highly recommend
    upgrading to Snow Leopard or Lion, as there are many new features in Xcode that
    are available only to these two operating systems.
