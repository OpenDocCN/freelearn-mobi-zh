- en: After being available for over a year, Swift has begun to mature and add new
    features rapidly. Apple has introduced Swift 2 along with some great new features
    and benefits to Xcode and underlying technologies. This book is intended to update
    Objective-C developers who want to migrate to Swift 2 and also to help Swift developers
    get a stronger base with better knowledge of this programming language and its
    second version.

    and Swift*, introduces you to some Xcode features that are Swift-specific. This
    might sound a bit advanced for the first chapter, but it is not difficult and
    it is also very important, mainly for those people who would like to develop professionally.'
