- en: After being available for over a year, Swift has begun to mature and add new
    features rapidly. Apple has introduced Swift 2 along with some great new features
    and benefits to Xcode and underlying technologies. This book is intended to update
    Objective-C developers who want to migrate to Swift 2 and also to help Swift developers
    get a stronger base with better knowledge of this programming language and its
    second version.

    and Swift*, introduces you to some Xcode features that are Swift-specific. This
    might sound a bit advanced for the first chapter, but it is not difficult and
    it is also very important, mainly for those people who would like to develop professionally.'

    be installed on Yosemite (OS X 10.10). This can only be installed on a Mac computer.
    So, this is basically what you need.
