<p class="mce-root">Magicians spend hours in front of a mirror, watching and studying every angle of their performance in order to get it just right. They realize that every detail needs to be perfect in order for the audience to believe in the illusion. Even a single mistake can ruin <span>not only </span>the illusion, but the entire performance and credibility of the magician. As harsh as it is, this is no different to what it's like building an AR app. If your app will immerse a user in your world, you need to make it as believable as possible. This includes ensuring that all the virtual objects in a scene look like they belong. Magicians use lighting and perspective tricks to fool the user into believing that something is real. We have already seen how we use perspective, so now we need to cover and enhance our use of lighting.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover how ARCore uses light estimation techniques to make the AR experience more believable to the user. We will then go on to extend some of those basic techniques in order to improve our future AR apps. Here are the main topics we will cover in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>3D rendering</li>
<li>3D lighting</li>
<li>Light estimation</li>
<li>Cg/HLSL shaders</li>
<li>Estimating light direction</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use Unity in this chapter because it provides an easier platform for learning about the rendering process, lighting, and more about shader programs. The shader programs in Unity are a different variety and are definitely worth taking a look at.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">While this chapter is less than halfway through the book, a reader should consider this as an advanced chapter. We will again be covering more about shader <span>programs</span> and 3D math concepts. Here's a good site for those of you who want to review or just get a basic understanding of 3D math, through this tutorial, <em>3D Math: Vector Math for 3D Computer Graphics</em> at <a href="http://chortle.ccsu.edu/vectorlessons/vectorindex.html">http://chortle.ccsu.edu/vectorlessons/vectorindex.html</a>.

<p>Before we get into talking about light estimation for AR, let's step back and review the rendering process of a 3D model. Take a look at the following diagram that explains the rendering process at a high level:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter packt_figref CDPAlign"><img src="assets/06d37bf8-5c90-4970-8064-be27a97eceaf.jpg" style="width:44.58em;height:14.33em;"/><br/>
<br/>
Typical rendering process for a 3D model</div>
<p>Now, the diagram only visually <span>demonstrates </span>the rendering process. Geometry and vertex shaders never actually render a wireframe model. Rather, they only position and color vertices and surfaces, which are then fed into the pixel/fragment and lighting shaders. This last step is called <strong>rasterization</strong> and represents the final step when the 2D image is generated or rasterized.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox" style="padding-left: 60px">The rendering process we are talking about here is for standard real-time rendering on a device's GPU using DirectX or OpenGL. Keep in mind that there are other rendering processes used for real-time (voxel) and non real-time (ray tracing) rendering.<span><br/></span></div>
<p>Euclideon have developed a voxel-like rendering technology, which they are claiming to be, in their words, as follows:</p>
<div class="packt_quote">"The First Truly Applicable Hologram Tech is Here."</div>
<div class="packt_figref packt_quote" style="padding-left: 300px">- Euclideon</div>
<p>This sounds very promising and a game changer for AR and VR. However, this technology has come under incredible scrutiny for making, what some feel are outlandish claims of rendering trillions of points without frame rate loss.</p>

<p>As always, let's take a look at how this looks in our tools. Open up Unity with the sample ARCore project we have already installed, and perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the menu, select <span class="packt_screen">File</span> | <span class="packt_screen">New Scene</span>. This will create a new empty scene for us in Unity.</li>
<li>From the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> window, drag the <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span> prefab from the <kbd>Assets/GoogleARCore/HelloARExample/Prefabs</kbd> folder into the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> window, as shown in the following screen excerpt:</li>

Select <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span> and modify <span class="packt_screen">Transform Scale</span> to <span class="packt_screen">X </span>as<span> </span><kbd>25</kbd>, <span class="packt_screen">Y </span>as<span> </span><kbd>25</kbd>, and <span class="packt_screen">Z </span>as<span> </span><kbd>25</kbd>.

<div class="packt_infobox">The <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> window in Unity is for composing your scene objects. This is where you will generally do most of your work in Unity. The <span class="packt_screen">Game</span> window represents <span>the view</span>, as close as possible, as it is rendered in game. Unfortunately, for ARCore apps, we are limited to testing on a device and thus unable to generate an accurate game view. This is why, for now anyway, we will work in a separate scene for discovery purposes.</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>From the menu, select <span class="packt_screen">GameObject</span> | <span class="packt_screen">3D Object</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Plane</span>. This will add a new plane to the scene. Ensure that the plane is positioned at <kbd>0</kbd>,<kbd>0</kbd>,<kbd>0</kbd> by clicking on the Gear icon beside the <span class="packt_screen">Transform</span> component in the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> window and selecting <span class="packt_screen">Reset</span> <span class="packt_screen">Position</span> from the menu. After you do that, <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span> will be casting a shadow on the plane.</li>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Okay, now we have seen how Unity renders a scene and the various draw modes available. However, we still need to go over how an object is colored or textured. In Unity, we typically use materials, shaders, and textures to render 3D objects. A material is essentially an encapsulation of a shader, its dependent textures, and other settings. Let's see what <span class="packt_screen">AndyMaterial</span> looks like in Unity by following the given steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <kbd>Assets/GoogleARCore/HelloARExample/Materials/Andy</kbd> folder in the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> window and select <span class="packt_screen">AndyMaterial</span>. Look at the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> window and note the name of the <span class="packt_screen">Shader</span> (<kbd>ARCoreDiffuseWithLightEstimation</kbd>) at the top. The current <span class="packt_screen">Shader</span> uses a simple lighting model and has been optimized for mobile AR, which we don't currently need, so we will change it.</li>
<li>Expand the <span class="packt_screen">Shader</span> dropdown in <span class="packt_screen">AndyMaterial</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Standard</span>. This will switch the material to using the <span class="packt_screen">Standard</span> <span class="packt_screen">Shader</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><img src="assets/2a606dce-ceea-4292-8a90-48daba9241f9.png" style="width:23.58em;height:31.33em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Switching Andy to use the Standard Unity shader</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>The first thing you will immediately note is that <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span> gets very dark. This is because the <span class="packt_screen">Metallic</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Smoothness</span> are turned way up. Use your mouse to adjust the various values to something more pleasant, as shown by the red arrows in the preceding screenshot. Perhaps a metallic shiny <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span>?</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">One thing to note when adjusting materials is that any changes you make to a material will be automatically saved and persisted even when running in the play or demo mode. Sometimes, it is useful to have backups of settings, especially if you found them difficult to achieve.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Make a copy of <span class="packt_screen">AndyMaterial</span> by selecting it in the <span class="packt_screen">Project</span> window and typing <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>D</em> or <em>command</em> + <em>D</em> on Mac. Rename the new material <span class="packt_screen">StandardAndyMaterial</span>.</li>
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">AndyMaterial</span> again. Change <span class="packt_screen">Shader</span> back to <kbd>ARCore/DiffuseWithLightEstimation</kbd>. Note how the look of <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span> quickly changes.</li>
<li>From the menu, select <span class="packt_screen">File</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Save Scenes</span>. Save the scene to the <kbd>Assets/GoogleARCore/HelloARExample/Scenes</kbd> folder as <kbd>RenderingTest.scene</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, there are plenty of options and settings that can go into rendering a 3D object. Feel free to explore on your own what each of the material settings are on the <span class="packt_screen">Standard Shader</span>. In the next section, we will expand our understanding of rendering by discussing lighting.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>So far, we have looked at the basics of the rendering process and how a 3D model is rendered. What we omitted in the first section, however, is how lighting plays into this. In order to get a sense of the importance of lights in a 3D scene, how about we go ahead and turn out the lights. Open up Unity to where we left off in the first section and follow along:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Directional Light</span> object in the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> window.</li>
<li>Disable the <span class="packt_screen">Light</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> window by unchecking the box beside the object's name. This will turn off or disable the light. You will note that not all the lights go off, however. This is because we have an ambient or global light that is used to account for general light scattering.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>You are now left with a dark object with no lights and shadows. Turn back on the <span class="packt_screen">Directional Light</span> by clicking on the checkbox. Take a look at the properties of the <span class="packt_screen">Light</span> in the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window, as shown:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><img src="assets/8ba30c1d-96a4-4608-a149-0560247d2fa9.png" style="width:30.00em;height:35.00em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Directional Light properties in the Inspector window</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Play with the <span class="packt_screen">Type</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Color</span>, <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Mode</strong></span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Shadow Type</span><span> properties</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Inspector</span> window. There are four different types of lights you can work with. The <span class="packt_screen">Directional</span> type represents a light source such as the sun, and as such, we only need to identify the direction the light is pointing. For the other light types, such as <strong>point</strong> and <strong>spot</strong>, you will need to position the light in the scene correctly in order to see any effects.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">We can calculate simple 3D diffuse lighting with the following equation:<br/>
<br/>
<img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/9e407203-35eb-49da-8758-82d70b640467.png" style="width:8.50em;height:1.42em;"/><br/>
Here:<br/>

<img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/ec79985f-08b2-431b-b4e5-ce76d43d63c7.png" style="width:1.42em;height:1.33em;"/> is the normal to the surface<br/>
<img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/6a2d28c1-8564-4d7b-9564-2c7ace5febf8.png" style="width:0.75em;height:1.33em;"/> is the intensity of light [0 to 1]<br/>
<br/>
<img class="fm-editor-equation" src="assets/0edecbb9-9645-4bc9-bd5e-7613ef9651a7.png" style="width:0.75em;height:1.33em;"/> is then multiplied by the color in order to determine the resulting lit color.</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>The <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Standard</strong> Shader</span> we looked at earlier uses <strong>Physically-Based Rendering </strong>(<strong>PBR</strong>) or a lighting model, which is quite sophisticated. Unfortunately, PBR shaders are currently limited for mobile platforms and often don't work or have poor performance. Often, the devices' GPU cannot support the additional instructions required for a PBR shader. Therefore, we will be limited to writing our own custom lighting shaders.</li>
<li>Let's explore switching shaders on our <span class="packt_screen">AndyMaterial</span> so that we can see what effect different lighting models have. Locate <span class="packt_screen">AndyMaterial</span> in the <kbd>Assets/GoogleARCore/HelloARExample/Materials/Andy</kbd> folder and select it.</li>
<li>Switch between <kbd>ARCore/DiffuseWithLightEstimation</kbd>, <strong><span class="packt_screen">Mobile Diffuse</span></strong>, and the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Standard</strong></span> shaders to see the effects or the different lighting models, as illustrated:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><img src="assets/d41cd325-4480-4822-9f63-a8878a28646f.jpg" style="width:32.50em;height:10.92em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Comparison of lighting models from three different shaders</div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Obviously, the <span class="packt_screen">Standard</span> shader looks the most natural, but as we learned, PBR <span>shaders are currently not supported on mobile platforms. Another option would be the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Mobile Diffuse</span> shader; let's see how that shader looks in our AR sample app.</li>
<li>Switch the shader to the <span class="packt_screen">Mobile Diffuse</span> one and then save the project (<span class="packt_screen">File </span>| <span class="packt_screen">Save Project</span>).</li>
<li>Connect your device and type <em>Ctrl </em>+ <em>B</em>, <em>command </em>+ <em>B</em> on Mac. This will build and run the app on your device. Play with the app and wait for a surface to be visible and then tap and place <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note anything different about our friend? That's right, he appears to stick out like a hot day in Canada. The reason for this is that the <span class="packt_screen">Mobile Diffuse</span> shader is assuming a consistent light source, which means our model is always getting the same light (direction and intensity), except that in the real world, as the user moves, light direction and intensity can change dramatically. Your device's camera will try and compensate for this, but you can still see perceptible changes in lighting, especially if the lighting around the user changes dramatically. You can see this by running the app again, and this time, take a closer look at how the lighting <span>looks different </span>on and around our model. ARCore solves this issue of inconsistent lighting by performing a process called light estimation. We will cover light estimation in detail in the next section.</p>

<p>Light estimation is a technique for replicating the lighting conditions of the real world and applying it to our 3D virtual objects. Ideally, we would like to be able to replicate the exact lighting conditions, but of course, we're not there yet. ARCore currently uses an image analysis algorithm to determine light intensity based on the current image from the device. This is then applied as global light to the 3D objects in the scene. Open up Unity again and let's see how this is done by following along the given steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Locate the <span class="packt_screen">AndyMaterial</span> again and revert its shader to <kbd>ARCore/DiffuseWithLightEstimation</kbd>.</li>
<li>Save the project (<span class="packt_screen">File</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Save Project</span>).</li>
<li>Connect your device and type <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>B</em> (<em>command</em> + <em>B</em> on Mac) to build and run the app on your device. Place a couple of <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span> models and alter the lighting conditions. Note how our objects respond to the changes in lighting.</li>
<li>
<p>Go back to Unity and double-click on the <kbd>HelloAR</kbd> scene in the <kbd>Assets/GoogleARCore/HelloARExample/Scenes</kbd> folder to open the scene. Feel free to save your <kbd>RenderingTest</kbd> scene.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Direct your attention to the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> window and double-click on <span class="packt_screen">Directional Light</span><strong> </strong>to focus and highlight it in the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> window. Note how the light is pointing straight down in the <span class="packt_screen">Scene</span> window. In the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window, you will see that the <span class="packt_screen">Shadow Type</span> is set to <span class="packt_screen">No Shadows</span>, and the <span class="packt_screen">Intensity</span> is turned down to <kbd>0.7</kbd>, which essentially turns the light into a directional ambient or global light.</li>
<li>Direct your attention back to the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> window and select <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Environmental Light</strong></span>. Go to the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window and click on the Gear icon beside the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Environmental Light (Script)</strong></span> component. Then, select the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Edit Script</strong></span> option from the context menu, as shown:</li>
</ol>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Editing the Environmental Light script</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>This will open up the script in your script editor. By default, Unity installs <strong>MonoDevelop</strong>, which will open the script if you have not installed and set a different editor. Scroll down to the <kbd>Update</kbd> method, as follows:</li>

<ol start="8">
<li>The <kbd>#if UNITY_EDITOR</kbd> is a compiler directive that checks whether the code is running in the editor. The reason we do this is so that when the code runs in the Unity editor, we want it to ignore any light estimation calculations. When the code is running in the editor, it will execute the next line; the <kbd>_GlobalLightEstimation</kbd> shader variable is set to <kbd>1</kbd>. This means that when the code is running in the editor, all it does is set our light to <kbd>1.0</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">You will come across the <kbd>#if UNITY_EDITOR</kbd> directive quite frequently when doing mobile development. This directive allows you to write test code that only executes when the code is running in the editor. This allows us to simulate the object running in the editor without the need to worry about ARCore services or device restrictions.</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Direct your attention to the <kbd>#else</kbd> block of code. This is code that is executed on the device and first checks whether the <kbd>Frame</kbd> is tracking. We have already seen this check in Android. The rest of the code is essentially just math, but if you look at the last highlighted line, you will see a call to <kbd>Frame.LightEstimate.PixelIntensity</kbd>. This is the call where ARCore reads the image from the camera and determines the current pixel intensity; a float value from 0 for a totally black image to <kbd>1</kbd> that is fully white. The intensity is normalized based on a constant called <kbd>MiddleGray</kbd>. The <kbd>MiddleGray</kbd> color or light intensity of <kbd>0.18f</kbd> corresponds roughly to the point where we humans stop recognizing colors.</li>
<li>We then use the <kbd>normalizedIntensity</kbd> to determine whether we want a linear change in lighting, when <kbd>normalizedIntensity</kbd> is less than <kbd>1.0</kbd>, or more gradually, when the intensity is greater than <kbd>1.0</kbd>. That's all that the rest of the math is doing, just making the lighting change more gradually after a certain threshold.</li>
<li>Change the <kbd>MiddleGray</kbd> constant to match the following line:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">const float MiddleGray = 1.0f;</pre>
<ol start="12">
<li>This will convert our light estimation to now use a linear model. Save the code change and return to Unity. Unity will automatically recompile the code and inform you of any errors in the status bar at the bottom of the editor.</li>
<li>Connect your device and build and run. Place an <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span> on a surface. Note how dark the figure is; this is because the lighting model is too abrupt.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">We are using a single channel of color or what you may also call gray scale. This is why we refer to values as a color but it is in fact just a single float. A gray scale color of <kbd>0.18f</kbd> is equivalent to the RGB color (<kbd>0.18f</kbd>, <kbd>0.18f</kbd>, <kbd>0.18f</kbd>) or what ARCore calls <kbd>MiddleGray</kbd>.</div>
<ol start="14">
<li>Change the <kbd>MiddleGray</kbd> constant back to <kbd>0.18f</kbd>, save the project, and run the app. Note the difference in lighting.</li>
</ol>
<p>This covers how ARCore uses image analysis techniques to read the light intensity from the camera's image and converts that value into a global light intensity or color. The lighting value is set on a shader, and we will follow how that value is used in the next section.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The shading language used in Unity is a variety of HLSL, or sometimes referred to as Cg. This shading variant provides two different forms of shaders: <strong>surface</strong> and <strong>vertex</strong>/<strong>fragment</strong> shaders. Now, coming from Android, this may sound confusing, since GLSL treats vertex and fragment shaders differently. However, variety of HLSL in Unity treats vertex and fragment shaders as the same, since they reside in the same file and are in the same workflow. A surface shader, which handles the lighting of our model, can be simple or quite complex. The Standard Unity surface shader uses a PBR lighting model, which is quite advanced and not supported on most mobile devices. This issue, combined with our limited ability to track scene lights, limits us to writing our own shaders in order to get our object lighting correct. ARCore provides us with a very simple surface shader that is used in the sample to light the <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span> model. Let's open up Unity and take a look at what that shader looks like by following the given steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load up the <kbd>HelloAR</kbd> sample project and scene.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">AndyMaterial</span> in the <kbd>Assets/GoogleARCore/HelloARExample/Materials/Andy</kbd> folder. Ensure that the <span class="packt_screen">Shader</span> is set to <kbd>ARCore/DiffuseWithLightEstimation</kbd>. Switch it back if you changed it.</li>
<li>Click on the Gear icon and from the context menu, select <span class="packt_screen">Edit Shader</span>. This will open the shader in your code editor, and it is also shown here for reference:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">Shader <span>"ARCore/DiffuseWithLightEstimation"<br/></span>{<br/>    Properties<br/>    {<br/>        _MainTex (<span>"Base (RGB)"</span>, <span>2D</span>) = <span>"white" </span>{}<br/>    }<br/><br/>    SubShader<br/>    {<br/>        Tags { <span>"RenderType"</span>=<span>"Opaque" </span>}<br/>        LOD <span>150<br/></span><span><br/></span><span>        </span>CGPROGRAM<br/>    #pragma surface surf Lambert noforwardadd finalcolor:lightEstimation<br/><br/>        sampler2D _MainTex;<br/>        fixed _GlobalLightEstimation;<br/><br/>        struct Input<br/>        {<br/>            float2 uv_MainTex;<br/>        };<br/><br/>    <span>void </span>lightEstimation(Input IN, SurfaceOutput o, inout fixed4   <br/>                         color)<br/>    {<br/>        color *= _GlobalLightEstimation;<br/>    }<br/><br/>    <span>void </span>surf (Input IN, inout SurfaceOutput o)<br/>    {<br/>        fixed4 c = tex2D(_MainTex, IN.uv_MainTex);<br/>        o.Albedo = c.rgb;<br/>        o.Alpha = c.a;<br/>    }<br/>    ENDCG<br/>  }<br/><br/>    Fallback <span>"Mobile/VertexLit"<br/></span>}</pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>This is a fairly simple diffuse lighting shader that uses the global light estimate we calculated earlier. It starts by defining itself with this line:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><span>Shader </span><span>"ARCore/DiffuseWithLightEstimation"</span></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Next, it defines <kbd>Properties</kbd> in the next code block, where <kbd>_MainTex</kbd> represents the base texture, is called <kbd>"Base (RGB)"</kbd>, and is set to <kbd>2D</kbd>. If you quickly look back at Unity, you can see this property in the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window.</li>
<li>The block of code that starts with <kbd>SubShader</kbd> is where the action happens. We first define <kbd>Tags</kbd>, which are sets of key/value pairs that set the rendering order and type parameters. In our example, we set this to <kbd>Opaque</kbd>. Then, we have the following line:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">LOD 150</pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>This determines the <strong>level of detail</strong> of the shader. The <kbd>LOD</kbd> directive is used to determine the complexity or performance requirements of the shader. You can set the value to anything, but typical values are shown in the following list:
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">VertexLit</span> kind of shaders = <kbd>100</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Decal</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Reflective VertexLit</span> = <kbd>150</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Diffuse</span> = <kbd>200</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Diffuse Detail</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Reflective Bumped Unlit</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Reflective Bumped VertexLit</span> = <kbd>250</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Bumped</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Specular</span> = <kbd>300</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Bumped Specular</span> = <kbd>400</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Parallax</span> = <kbd>500</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Parallax Specular</span> = <kbd>600</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As you can see from the list, the simple shader represents a low level of detail. This means that lower-level hardware should be able to run this shader without any issue. You can set the maximum shader LOD per shader or globally; check the Unity documentation for further details.</li>
<li>We start our actual shader code with <kbd>CGPROGRAM</kbd> and then define the form of surface shader with the <kbd>#pragma</kbd> directive, as shown in the following code:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><span>#pragma surface surf Lambert noforwardadd finalcolor:lightEstimation<br/><br/><strong>#pragma surface surfaceFunction lightModel [optionalparams]</strong><br/></span></pre>
<ol start="10">
<li>The first part of the directive, <kbd>surface</kbd>, defines this as a surface shader. Then, we see that the <kbd>surf</kbd> <span>function name </span>refers to the main surface function. Then comes the lighting model, <kbd>Lambert</kbd> in this case. After that, the options are set to <kbd>noforwardadd</kbd>, which is just a simple way to limit the number of lights to one. Finally, we use a custom modification function called <kbd>lightEstimation</kbd> that is set with <kbd>finalcolor:lightEstimation</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">This shader uses the Lambert lighting model. You can find plenty of examples of what lighting models Unity supports or how to write your own model at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-SurfaceShaderLightingExamples.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-SurfaceShaderLightingExamples.html</a>.</div>
<ol start="11">
<li>Just inside the <kbd>#pragma</kbd> directive, we see the definition of the shader inputs: <span><kbd>_MainTex</kbd>,</span> <span><kbd>_GlobalLightEstimation</kbd>, and <kbd>struct Input</kbd>. If you recall, <kbd>_GlobalLightEstimation</kbd> is the variable we set inside the</span> <kbd>EnvironmentalLight</kbd> <span>script to represent our global light.</span></li>
<li>Next, we will jump down a few lines to the <kbd>surf</kbd> function, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><span>void </span><span>surf (Input IN, inout SurfaceOutput o)<br/></span><span>{<br/></span><span> fixed4 c = tex2D(_MainTex, IN.uv_MainTex);<br/></span><span> o.Albedo = c.rgb;<br/></span><span> o.Alpha = c.a;<br/></span><span> }</span></pre>
<ol start="13">
<li>This function simply samples the color from our <kbd>_MainTex</kbd> using <kbd>tex2D</kbd> and the input <kbd>uv</kbd> coordinates. Then, it sets the color (<kbd>Albedo</kbd>) and <kbd>Alpha</kbd> from the lookup. This function is called first to determine the color of the surface, and then, its output is passed to the Lambert lighting model, after which the final color is set by the <kbd>lightEstimation</kbd> function.<br/>
An input marked as <kbd>inout</kbd> represents a value that can be modified and will automatically be returned.</li>
<li>Scroll up a bit to the <kbd>lightEstimation</kbd> function. Inside this function, the code, shown as follows, modifies the color based on the value that was set for <kbd>_GlobalLightEstimation</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><span>color *= _GlobalLightEstimation;</span></pre>
<ol start="15">
<li>Multiplying the color by the global light estimation is the same as adjusting the brightness with a dimmer switch.</li>
<li>Finally, we complete the shader with <kbd>Fallback</kbd> and the name of another shader. This sets the fall back or backup shader if the current shader is unable to run. A shader can fail due to compilation errors or hardware limitations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have a clear understanding of how the light estimation value we saw generated earlier is used in the shader, we can move to perhaps enhancing our lighting. If you recall, our current light just points straight down, but ideally, we would like to position the light to match the strongest light source. We will look at a simple but effective technique to track and position a light in AR in the next section.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Google provides us with a robust solution for estimating the amount of light in an AR scene with ARCore. As we learned, light direction is an equally important part of scene lighting. Google didn't intentionally ignore estimating light direction with ARCore; it's just that that problem is really difficult to do right. However, Google did provide us with just enough tools in ARCore to be able to estimate light direction, providing some simple assumptions. First, we need to assume that our user, for now anyway, will remain in the same room or area. Second, our user will need to look in at least an 180 degree arc across their vision, or more simply put, the user just needs to look around. Third, it works best if the real-world environment is lit from a distant single bright source, such as the sun. Based on those assumptions, we can simply store the direction the user saw the brightest image in and use that to reverse calculate our light direction. This may sound more complex than it is, so hopefully, the following diagram can explain this further:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><img src="assets/6845f85e-4266-4ec6-8a32-f96f0d76bdc2.jpg" style="width:37.92em;height:22.08em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Calculating light direction from camera pixel intensity</div>
<p>Now, this technique may sound quite complicated, but it isn't. We can actually accomplish this with just a few lines of code. Open up Unity and follow along to write our directional light detector:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that the <kbd>HelloAR</kbd> scene of the sample app is loaded.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Environmental Light</span> object in the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> window.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click on the Gear icon beside the <span class="packt_screen">Environmental Light (Script)</span> component in the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Inspector</strong></span> window and select <span class="packt_screen">Edit Script</span> from the context menu.</li>
<li>Just beneath the class declaration, add the following lines to declare new variables:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>public class EnvironmentalLight : MonoBehaviour</strong><br/><strong>{  </strong>//after me<br/>  public GameObject SceneCamera;<br/>  public GameObject SceneLight;<br/>  private float maxGlobal = float.MinValue;<br/>  private Vector3 maxLightDirection;</pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>These variables will hold a reference to the scene camera, light, the max global intensity we find, and the direction we find it.</li>
<li>Scroll down in the code until you see the identified line in the <kbd>Update</kbd> method, and add the following lines:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>const float Inclination = 0.4f; </strong>//after me<em><strong><br/></strong></em><br/>var pi = Frame.LightEstimate.PixelIntensity;<br/>if(pi &gt; maxGlobal)<br/>{<br/>  maxGlobal = pi;<br/>  SceneLight.transform.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(-SceneCamera.transform.forward);<br/>}<br/><br/></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>All this code does is use <kbd>Frame.LightEstimate.PixelIntensity</kbd> to read the light intensity for the current camera direction. Then, we check whether this value is higher than any previous seen value (<kbd>maxGlobal</kbd>). If it is, we set a new maximum value and rotate the light (<kbd>SceneLight</kbd>) in the opposite direction of the camera, which means that the light will face toward the camera.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_tip">Be careful when you edit code outside of the <kbd>#if UNITY_EDITOR</kbd> directive. This code won't be compiled until a build is run for the platform, which means that any errors in the code will be identified as build errors. This can be confusing, so be careful to avoid syntax errors when coding these sections.</div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Save the file; that's all the code we need to write in order to adjust the light direction. If you recall from the last section, the diffuse shader we are using doesn't account for light direction. However, ARCore has provided us with another shader that does.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li>Return to the editor to find and select the <span class="packt_screen">AndyMaterial</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Assets/GoogleARCore/HelloARExample/Materials/Andy</span> folder.</li>
<li>Change the material to use the <kbd>ARCore/SpecularWithLightEstimation</kbd> shader. This material shows the direction of light better.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Environmental Light</span> object in the <span class="packt_screen">Hierarchy</span> window. Note how we have two new properties added to the <span class="packt_screen">Environmental Light (Script)</span> component. These new properties (<span class="packt_screen">Scene Camera</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Scene Light</span>) were added because we declared them as <strong>public</strong> fields in the class.</li>
<li>Click on the icon that resembles a bullseye next to the <span class="packt_screen">Scene Camera</span> property. Then, as shown in the following excerpt, select the <span class="packt_screen">First Person Camera</span> object from the <span class="packt_screen">Select GameObject</span> dialog:</li>

<li>Close the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Select GameObject</strong></span> dialog.</li>
<li>Repeat the same process for setting the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span> as the <strong><span class="packt_screen">Scene Light</span></strong>.</li>
<li>Connect your device and build and run. Run the app in an area with a single bright light source and see how <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span> looks after you place it.</li>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Now <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span> should be lit from what looks like the brightest light source in the area. However, because we don't currently track changes in light direction, if you change rooms or the lighting changes, then the illusion is broken. Light tracking is difficult, and it's more difficult than tracking a user, except that we can put a simple hack in place to not track the lighting for as long as we do, which is currently forever, if you weren't paying attention. Follow along to put this simple hack in the code we just wrote:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up the <kbd>EnvrionmentalLight.cs</kbd> script in your text editor of choice. If you forgot how to do this, just look back a few pages.</li>
<li>Add the following line right after and before the lines identified:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>var pi = Frame.LightEstimate.PixelIntensity; </strong>//after me<br/>maxGlobal *= .98f;<br/><strong>if(pi &gt; maxGlobal){  </strong>//before me</pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>That single line is a degrade function on the <kbd>maxGlobal</kbd> variable. Remember that <kbd>maxGlobal</kbd> is the value we identify as the strongest light source. This simple function, yep function, degrades this value over time. The value of <kbd>.98f</kbd> sets the speed of decay. A value of <kbd>.98f</kbd> represents a fairly quick decay rate, whereas a value of <kbd>.9999f</kbd> would represent a slow decay.</li>
<li>Save the file, and yep, that's it.</li>
<li>Go back to Unity. Connect and build and run the app. Now when you place an <span class="packt_screen">Andy</span>, you should quickly see changes in what the app identifies as the strongest light source. Feel free to go back and change the decay rate or alter the function and use your own method; experiment.</li>
</ol>
<p>What we put together is a simple way to track and estimate light direction. As we mentioned, this method works, but it's certainly not without its limitations. In any case, this should give the curious reader enough to continue and extend this further. We also completely avoided a proper discussion of shadows. Fortunately, we will have plenty of time to do that in <a href="843257a4-843b-4278-99df-fec1e2bd996b.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <span><em>Blending Light for Architectural Design</em>,</span> where we will allow the user to transform their own living space.</p>

<li>Change the <kbd>maxGlobal</kbd> rate of decay. You decide whether to make it faster or slower.</li>
<li> Increase or decrease the <kbd>maxGlobal</kbd> rate of decay based on the user's amount of movement. Hint—recall how we tracked the user, and use that to determine how far they have gone or how fast. Use that information to set the rate of decay.</li>
<li> Write your own custom lighting surface shader. This one's difficult, but it's worth the effort.</li>

<p>Certainly, as you become more of an expert in AR, you realize how important lighting is to augmented reality. It's so important that Google developed ARCore with light estimation built in, which is why we spent this entire chapter on the subject. First, we learned about the rendering process in a bit more depth; then, we covered 3D lighting, an essential bit of knowledge that we will need in order to understand the added complexity of lighting in AR. This led us to look at the way ARCore estimates the light levels or global light in an area by taking a closer look at Unity Cg/HLSL shaders and, more specifically, surface shaders. Finally, we implemented a simple but effective hack to track and estimate light direct in a scene, which we left the reader with to improve on in their own time.</p>
<p>Estimating the actual lighting conditions of the environment will be a major hurdle for AR to overcome. However, with the incredible advances in AI and Machine Learning, we will likely see some better solutions come out soon. We will take a closer look at how Machine Learning can assist AR in the next chapter.</p>
