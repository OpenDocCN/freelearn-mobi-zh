- en: Whether you are relatively new to iOS app development or a seasoned expert,
    *Apple Pay Essentials* provides the skills that you need to easily incorporate
    Apple Pay into the payment workflows of your apps. This book shows you how to
    obtain the certificates that ensure payment information is securely transmitted
    between the user's iOS device, your payment gateway, and the banks involved in
    an Apple Pay transaction. The book teaches you how to provide a simple and consistent
    user experience, which expedites the time between desire and acquire. You learn
    how to respond to changes that the user makes to your preconfigured payment sheet,
    which is where the user confirms or modifies order and payment details. This book
    guides you through the interactions that your app makes with your payment gateway
    and your order-processing system. Finally, this book shows you how to design a
    simple order-processing web app that processes orders and payments submitted by
    client apps.

    Workflow*, describes how to create a payment request, which is an object that
    stores information that is critical to payment processing (such as currency and
    payment network requirements) and details about the customer''s order. It also
    shows you how to manage the main elements of the Apple Pay user experience: the
    **Apple** **Pay** button, and the payment sheet. This chapter also explains how
    to get inventory details from an order-processing web app, and how to present

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To follow along with the content presented in this book, which is based on
    the book''s example code, you need the hardware and software needed for iOS development:
    a development Mac, an iOS device that supports Apple Pay, and a recent version
    of the Xcode developer tools. You need to be able to build apps on your Mac and
    run them on the iOS device, which requires a wired connection between the computer
    and the device (so that Xcode can install the app on the device). When running
    the example app on iOS Simulator, the example app connects to the order management
    web app running on the computer through a URI that targets the appropriate process.
    When running the app on the iOS device, however, the connection must be done wirelessly.
    Therefore, you need to configure your development Mac as a proxy server so that
    HTTP requests to the order management web app from the iOS device are resolved
    by the web app on the computer and do not go to the wider network. The documentation
    in the example code explains how to configure your development Mac as a proxy
    server using the SquidMan proxy-server software.'
