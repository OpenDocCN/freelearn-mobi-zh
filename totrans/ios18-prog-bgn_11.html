    <p class="normal">Welcome to <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book. At this point, you’re familiar with the Xcode user interface, and you have a solid foundation of using Swift. In this part, you’ll start creating the user interface of a journal app, named <em class="italic">JRNL</em>. You will use Interface Builder to build the screens that your app will use, add elements such as buttons, labels, and fields to them, and connect them together using segues. As you will see, you can do this with a minimum of coding.</p>
