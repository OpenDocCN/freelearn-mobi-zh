<p>So, in our last chapter, we successfully set up our Android Studio with the required components to start working on our project right away. Let's get started. In order to learn about the Android project structure, we must first open up a new project.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Creating your first Android Studio project</h1>
            

            
                
<p>Open your Android Studio, and click on Start a new Android Studio project, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" height="515" src="img/B05066_5066_13.png" width="681"/></div>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign CDPAlignLeft">Once you start a new project, you will see the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" height="465" src="img/B05066_01_14.png" width="673"/></div>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign CDPAlignLeft">In this screen, fill in the details of your first Android app:</p>
<ul>
<li class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign CDPAlignLeft">Application name is the name of your app, which will appear on the icon of your phone when it is installed.</li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Company Domain is an identifier for your app. Make sure that you keep this common throughout your apps for better organization and convention.</li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Package name is another important unique identifier for your app. We learned about this in our <a href="7fe5acac-a18a-4ddf-8420-5bdca43b1c02.xhtml">first chapter</a> and saw its naming conventions. Refer to that part if you have any doubts regarding package names and their naming.</li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Include C++ support is optional. For the purpose of this book, we will keep it unchecked for now.</li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Project location is the path where your project folder will be situated on your computer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Once you are ready after filling in all these details, press Next.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Now, you will see this screen:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" src="img/B05066_01_15.png"/></div>
<p>Different platforms for your Android app</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">For the purpose of this book, we will only work with Phone and Tablet. However, you can try experimenting with other platforms as well, once you are comfortable with the development cycle. </p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Minimum SDK is the OS version that would be required as a minimum factor to run your app. It is recommended that you select the lowest version for your app to run on as many OS versions as possible. However, do note that some functions are deprecated from further versions, so it is recommended that you use Minimum API 14: Android 4.0 (IceCreamSandwich) for hassle-free development. You will also be prompted about how many devices will be supporting your app, as you can see in the image. These figures are real time and change as the market share of an OS changes.</p>
<p>If you want to know about the updated market share and some more interesting stuff related to various versions and their respective market share, you can visit the official Android website at <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html</a>.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Once we select our Fullscreen Activity, press Next, as follows:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" height="483" src="img/B05066_01_16.png" width="699"/></div>
<p>Different types of activities</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You could say that an activity is simply a default layout. Since we are creating a game, we will use a Fullscreen Activity. As you can see in the preceding screenshot, you have many different activity options to choose from, which are quite self-explanatory on their own. So, let's select Fullscreen Activity and press Next:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" height="460" src="img/B05066_01_17.png" width="666"/></div>
<p>Naming your activities</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Activity Name is the name of your Java class that will be generated. We will be working with this file a lot, so make sure that you remember it.</p>
<p>Layout Name is the name of the XML file, which will deal with how and what components will appear on your app visually. There are some naming conventions that need to be followed for XML files. They are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names must be all lowercase</li>
<li>An underscore is used to separate two words instead of spaces.</li>
<li>Always prefix the filename with the type of resources; for instance, if your XML file corresponds to an activity such as <kbd>MainActivity.java</kbd>, then your filename would be <kbd>activity_main.xml</kbd>.</li>
<li>If you have a subitem of a specific group, such as a list item of main activity, then it can be named by suffixing it as <kbd>activity_main_list_item.xml</kbd>.</li>
<li>This way, you can either suffix or prefix a keyword for your filename, as you prefer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Title is the name that will appear on the top bar of your app. The title you use for the Activity and the class name of the main Activity might be different; titles may also contain spaces.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Once you are finished with all of this, click on Finish and give yourself a pat on the back. You have successfully learned how to create an Android Studio Project. After this, wait for a few seconds/minutes depending on your system's performance for your project to set up; once it is ready, you will see the following screen:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" height="355" src="img/B05066_01_18.png" width="665"/></div>
<p>Our Android Studio Project Folder</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">If for some reason, you are not able to see this screen after waiting, then click on the 1: Project option, which is vertically aligned below FirstGame on the upper-left corner of the screen.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Congratulations! You have successfully created your first app now. At this point, you can go ahead and run the project and see how it runs on the emulator; however, before we do that, let's walk through the project folder structure of this project. Let's expand each folder to understand it further. Now, this part is very important, since this will serve as a foundation for almost every basic thing you will be doing in Android Studio, so make sure that you understand this properly.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Project Structure of an Android Project</h1>
            

            
                
<p>Click on the small arrow on the left-hand side of each folder to expand its view:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" height="378" src="img/B05066_01_19.png" width="708"/></div>
<p>Various folders inside the project folder</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">As you can see, we have multiple folders in our project folder. Our main project folder contains three subfolders, which are <kbd>manifest</kbd>, <kbd>java</kbd>, and <kbd>res</kbd>; we will explore each of these folders individually now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><kbd>manifest</kbd>: This folder contains your <kbd>AndroidManifest.xml</kbd> file, which is responsible for giving permissions to your app, as we learned in the preceding chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><kbd>java</kbd>: This folder contains all your <kbd>.java</kbd> files, which are your Java code files. Generally, this folder has multiple subfolders that have your package name at the top, and within them, are source code files. You can observe in the preceding screenshot that we have our <kbd>java</kbd> folder, and we have a folder named <kbd>nikhil.nikmlnkr.game</kbd> within that, which is actually the package name of our game, and we have our <kbd>FullScreenActivity</kbd> within that. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><kbd>res</kbd>: This folder contains all your resources. <kbd>res</kbd> here simply means resources that can include anything from simple string data to images to complex XML layouts. Simple terms, most of the things you see on the screen are stored here. You can design your front-end with the help of resources that you keep in the <kbd>res</kbd> folder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know what these folders are, let's start designing our first program. Also, to stay true to our programming background, let's start with the famous <kbd>Hello World</kbd> example. Things are going to get really interesting from this point on. By now, you have grasped pretty much all the basics you need to start development. Now, in a matter of a few minutes, you will be ready with your very first Android app that you can run on your phone. So, without further ado, let's begin!</p>
<p>If you can see a screen with two big blue windows saying DUMMY CONTENT, as seen in the preceding screenshot, you are good to start; otherwise simply navigate to the <kbd>res/layout/</kbd> folder and double-click on <kbd>activity_fullscreen.xml</kbd> to open the XML layout in which we will be working now. </p>
<p>Now, you can see many options in front of you; don't get overwhelmed or scared. You will soon learn and master the art of creating amazing user interfaces with the tools in front of you.</p>

            </footer>

        
    

        

            
                <h1 class="header-title">Creating our Hello World! program</h1>
            

            
                
<p>So, let's create our first <kbd>Hello World</kbd> program. As you can see, you have a Palette in front of you besides the blue DUMMY CONTENT window. Simply drag and drop the TextView component onto your DUMMY CONTENT screen, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p>
<p><img class="image-border" src="img/B05066_02_08.png"/></p>
<p>Dragging and dropping TextView component onto our screen</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Notice the new Properties window when you successfully place TextView in the DUMMY CONTENT screen.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Now, you can see a blank Text View component on your screen, but there's nothing written on it. To have something written on it, we need to modify its properties a little. Check out the Properties on the right-hand side of the screen and, in the text component over there, type in <kbd>Hello World!</kbd>. Also, you can see that our text is very small. Let's change that to make it a little bigger so that it can be clearly visible to us. Locate the last option in the Properties window named textAppearance. Click on the drop-down menu next to it, and select any option that suits your choice from there. For this example, we will use AppCompat.Headline; however, you can choose whatever you want to. Once you are done with it, you will see something like this:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="img/B05066_02_09.png"/></p>
<p>Your first Hello World! program is ready!</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">That's it! You are now ready to execute your program! Easy peasy, lemon squeezy, right? Let's move on to actually executing this code now. For this purpose, we will need to run something known as the <strong>Emulator</strong>. An emulator is simply a virtual device that will act as an Android device on your PC, so you don't have to actually test your app on an Android device every time. You will need to follow a few steps to set up an emulator, so let's get started with it. You will only have to set up the emulator once, and next time, it will be ready for you.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Setting up the emulator </h1>
            

            
                
<p>Click on the green play icon to start executing your first program and set up your emulator:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" height="370" src="img/B05066_01_22.png" width="693"/></div>
<p>The play button can be found on the top of the screen as marked in this image</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign CDPAlignLeft">Now, click on Create New Virtual Device and make sure that Use same selection for future launches is checked:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" height="418" src="img/B05066_02_11.png" width="529"/></div>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Select a device of your choice, and click on Next:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="img/B05066_02_12.png"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Select Nougat with API Level 24, and click on Next:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="img/B05066_02_13.png"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Give a name to your emulator (optional) in the AVD Name field and select a Portrait -Startup orientation and click on Finish:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="img/B05066_02_14.png"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">You can see that the latest device that you created will now appear in the list of Available Virtual Devices; select it and click on OK:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="img/B05066_02_15.png"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Click on OK after selecting your device</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>ONLY FOR WINDOWS SYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Now you may get the following message, as seen in the screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" height="392" src="img/B05066_02_16.png" width="499"/></div>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft">If you get an ONLY FOR WINDOWS SYSTEMS message, then follow these steps; otherwise, you can skip this part:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter BIOS by restarting your computer and pressing <em>Delete</em>, <em>Esc</em>, or <em>F1</em> depending on your system.</li>
<li>Go to Processor/Chipset settings.</li>
<li>Enable Virtualization Technology.</li>
</ol>
<p>This can happen due to a couple of problems. HAXM problems often occur because of Intel chipsets. The <strong>Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager</strong> (<strong>Intel® HAXM</strong>) is a hardware-assisted virtualization engine (hypervisor) that uses <strong>Intel Virtualization Technology</strong> (<strong>Intel® VT</strong>) to speed up Android app emulation on a host machine. In combination with Android x86 emulator images provided by Intel and the official Android SDK Manager, HAXM allows for faster Android emulation on Intel VT-enabled systems:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" height="375" src="img/B05066_01_29.png" width="703"/></div>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft">Once you do this, a small window will open below the screen, and your build process will start. Wait for some time and your emulator will open up:</p>
<div><img class="image-border" height="489" src="img/B05066_02_18.png" width="267"/></div>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft">Congratulations! Your Hello World! program is running successfully.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft">Give yourself a pat on the back. You have now successfully executed your first program. </p>
