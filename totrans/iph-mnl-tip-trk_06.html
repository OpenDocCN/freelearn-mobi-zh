			<h1 id="_idParaDest-92"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>Chapter 6</em>: Using Siri</h1>
			<p>Most people are familiar with using the touchscreen interface of the iPhone or a similar smartphone. While tapping, swiping, and pinching the screen can be powerful ways to control an iPhone, an even more revolutionary interface is to use your voice.</p>
			<p>Siri represents the new user interface that relies solely on voice commands. By simply speaking to Siri, you can control many features of your iPhone, from making phone calls and scheduling events to searching the internet and changing settings. With Siri, you can control your iPhone with nothing more than your voice. </p>
			<p>Just keep in mind that although Siri can understand and respond to a wide variety of voice commands, it's still not perfect. Sometimes when talking to Siri, you may need to rephrase your commands using different words or changing the order of your words. </p>
			<p>The topics we will cover in the chapter are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting up Siri</li>
				<li>Giving commands to Siri</li>
				<li>Asking Siri questions</li>
				<li>Dictating with Siri</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/><a id="_idTextAnchor276"/><a id="_idTextAnchor277"/><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>Setting up Siri</h1>
			<p>You can start talking to Siri as soon as<a id="_idIndexMarker361"/> you get a new iPhone. However, you may want to take a moment to customize Siri's settings so that Siri behaves the way you want. </p>
			<p>The first way to customize Siri is by defining how to start Siri in the first place. Three common ways to start Siri are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Press the Home button (for those iPhone models that have a physical Home button).</li>
				<li>Say "Hey Siri" out loud.</li>
				<li>Press the Side button (for newer iPhone models that do not have a Home button).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Another way to customize Siri is to define the voice and language. You can choose between a male or female voice with different types of accents, depending on your particular language. For example, English speakers can choose between several options, such as American, British, or Indian accents.</p>
			<p>The language you choose will be whatever<a id="_idIndexMarker362"/> language you prefer speaking and hearing. Whatever language you choose, you'll likely have regional options as well. For example, French speakers can choose between France, Canada, or Belgium regions since each region tends to say words in a slightly different manner. </p>
			<p>To customize Siri, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home Screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Siri &amp; Search</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Siri &amp; Search</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.1</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer150"><img alt="Figure 6.1 – The Siri &amp; Search screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – The Siri &amp; Search screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Listen for "Hey Siri"</strong> switch to turn this option on or off.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Press Side Button for Siri</strong> or <strong class="bold">Press Home for Siri</strong> switch to turn this option on or off. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Allow Siri When Locked</strong> switch if you want to be able to talk to Siri even if your iPhone is locked (if you choose this option, you'll also need to type in your passcode to verify that you want this option on or off).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Language</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Language</strong> screen<a id="_idIndexMarker363"/> appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.2</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer151"><img alt="Figure 6.2 – The Language screen for selecting Siri's language&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor279"/><a id="_idTextAnchor280"/></p><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – The Language screen for selecting Siri's language</p></li>
				<li>Tap the specific language you prefer, such as <strong class="bold">English (India)</strong> or <strong class="bold">English (United Kingdom)</strong>. Then, tap the <strong class="bold">Siri &amp; Search</strong> button in the upper-left corner to return to the <strong class="bold">Siri &amp; Search</strong> screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Siri Voice</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Siri Voice</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.3</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer152"><img alt="Figure 6.3 – The Siri Voice screen for choosing Siri's vocal personality&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.03_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"/><a id="_idTextAnchor282"/>Figure 6.3 – The Siri Voice screen for choosing Siri's vocal personality</p></li>
				<li>Tap an accent<a id="_idIndexMarker364"/> and gender (<strong class="bold">Male</strong> or <strong class="bold">Female</strong>). Then, tap the <strong class="bold">Siri &amp; Search</strong> button in the upper-left corner to return to the <strong class="bold">Siri &amp; Search</strong> screen if you want to make any additional changes to Siri.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Feel free to experiment with different Siri options until you find the ones you like best. For example, try using Siri with a male or female voice to see which one you like best. Even if you live in a particular area, try changing Siri to speak in an accent from another region. That might make Siri sound more pleasant to your ears.</p>
			<p>Once you have Siri set up, you<a id="_idIndexMarker365"/> can always go back and change the options at any time. The first step is to try starting Siri in all the different ways you defined, such as pressing the Side button or Home button, or saying "Hey Siri."</p>
			<p>Remember, Siri requires a connection to a cellular phone network or a Wi-Fi network. That's because Siri needs to send data back to Apple's servers to process requests and then send the answers back to your iPhone. If you do not have access to a cellular phone or Wi-Fi network, Siri may not work at all<a id="_idTextAnchor283"/><a id="_idTextAnchor284"/>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"/>Asking Siri questions</h1>
			<p>One of the simplest ways to use Siri is to <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>get information that you might ask a friend, such as finding the current weather forecast, getting the historical or geographical information about a place, or learning trivia about a popular movie.  </p>
			<p>Although Siri can understand spoken commands, it might not always give you the answer directly. Instead, Siri might just point you to a website where you might find the answer you're looking for. For example, ask Siri "How many books did Mark Twain write?" Then, Siri displays an answer on the screen with an option to tap on the Safari icon to view a web page containing the answer, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.4</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer153">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – Siri might display websites where you can find the answer</p>
			<p>To ask Siri a question, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri the way you defined, such as pressing the Side or Home buttons, or saying "Hey Siri." The Siri icon appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.5</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer154"><img alt="Figure 6.5 – The Siri screen waiting for you to speak&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – The Siri screen waiting for you to speak</p></li>
				<li>Ask a question. When you're finished <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>asking your question, remain silent so that Siri will know that you are done. After a moment, Siri will respond with an answer.  </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Asking Siri questions can be fun, but you can also use Siri as an assistant to help you accomplish specific tasks. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"/>Giving Siri commands</h1>
			<p>When you ask Siri a question, Siri may <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>or may not know how to answer. Rather than asking questions covering a variety of topics, it's far more useful to use Siri to save time. Rather than performing specific tasks yourself, just tell Siri what to do. Not only is Siri far more accurate at performing common tasks, but relying on Siri can also save you the time of tapping through various screens to perform common tasks such as setting up appointments or alarms yourself.</p>
			<p>Some of the different tasks <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>Siri can perform include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Getting the current time </li>
				<li>Getting the current weather</li>
				<li>Translating words and phrases</li>
				<li>Setting, editing, and deleting an alarm</li>
				<li>Setting a timer</li>
				<li>Setting a reminder</li>
				<li>Setting an appointment</li>
				<li>Getting directions </li>
				<li>Sending and receiving text messages </li>
				<li>Making phone calls</li>
				<li>Opening an app</li>
				<li>Tracking flights above you</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at how we<a id="_idIndexMarker370"/> can get Siri to perform these tasks. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor287"/>Getting the current time</h2>
			<p>One of the simplest tasks Siri can <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>perform is to get the time. You can just ask for the time, such as saying "Hey Siri, what time is it?" This will return the time in your current location.</p>
			<p>Another option is to ask for the time in another city, just in case you want to know whether you can call someone in that city if they live in a different time zone. In that case, you might say, "Hey Siri, what time is it in Berlin?"</p>
			<p>If you don't specify a location, Siri will assume that you want the time in your current location. So, if you want to know the time in another location, make sure you specify that location. </p>
			<p>It's generally best to specify a particular city, rather than a country, since a country may be divided into separate time zones. By specifying a specific city, you can help Siri narrow down its answer to a specific time zone.</p>
			<p>To ask for the current time, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Ask "What time is it"? or "What time is it in ______ (name a city)?" Siri responds with the time displayed, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.6</em>. Notice that Siri also displays the number of hours the time in the other city might be ahead or behind your current time, such as +9 hours ahead:</li>
			</ol>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – Asking Siri for the time in another city</p>
			<p>Knowing the time in your <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>current location or another location can be handy, but you might also want to know the weather too, especially if you plan to travel to another city soon.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor288"/>Getting the current weather</h2>
			<p>Knowing the time in <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>another city can be handy if you want to call someone in that region and want to make sure they're awake. For travelers planning to visit another city, it can be handy to know the weather so that you can dress appropriately.</p>
			<p>To ask about the weather, simply use a common weather-related term, such as "temperature," "hot," "cold," or "rain," or just say "weather." </p>
			<p>Next, you can mention what day or time you want the weather information for, such as "today," "tomorrow," "next week," "morning," or "tonight."</p>
			<p>If you don't specify a city, Siri will assume that you want the weather forecast for your current location. Otherwise, mention a specific city for that region's weather. </p>
			<p>To get weather information, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Ask a question using a weather-related term (such as "How hot will it be"), a time (such as "tonight"), and a location (such as "in Tokyo"). Siri responds with the weather forecast, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.7</em>: </li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer156">
					<img alt="Figure 6.7 – Asking Siri for weather information&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.07_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.7 – Asking Siri for weather information</p>
			<p>Knowing the weather in other <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>parts of the world can be useful if you plan to travel there soon. If that region of the world speaks a different language, you might also want to know common words or phrases to say.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor289"/>Translating words and phrases</h2>
			<p>Learning a foreign language <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>can be difficult, so you might want to rely on Siri to help you learn certain words and phrases. By using your iPhone and Siri as a translator, you'll be able to communicate with people in other parts of the world enough to get the information you need without necessarily being fluent in another language.</p>
			<p>Just ask Siri for the word or phrase you want to translate and the language you want, such as "Hey Siri, what's the French word for hotel?" or "How do you say taxi in Russian?" </p>
			<p>When Siri responds, you'll see a written translation, along with hearing Siri pronounce the word or phrase correctly in the foreign language you chose.</p>
			<p>To translate words or phrases into another language, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Ask a question and specify the word or phrase you want to translate and the language you want. Siri responds with the translation, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.8</em>. You can tap the play button to hear Siri pronounce the word or phrase again:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.8 – Asking Siri to translate languages</p>
			<p>No matter where you<a id="_idIndexMarker376"/> might be in the world, you'll likely need to keep track of time, such as knowing when to catch a plane or when to get to an appointment. To help you keep track of time, let Siri set alarms and timers for you.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99">Setting, editing, and deleting an<a id="_idTextAnchor290"/><a id="_idTextAnchor291"/> alarm </h2>
			<p>Normally, you can set, edit, and delete <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>alarms manually through the Clock app. However, doing<a id="_idIndexMarker378"/> any of these tasks takes <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>several steps, so you might find that it's much easier to let Siri do the work for you. </p>
			<p>An alarm can alert you when it gets to a specific time. If you need to get up early in the morning, you might set an alarm to wake you up at a specific time, such as 5 o'clock in the morning. </p>
			<p>To set an alarm, specify a time for the alert and mention "alarm" or "wake me up." You can also specify a day or time, such as "Wake me up in an hour" or "Set an alarm at 8:00 AM every Saturday."</p>
			<p>To set an alarm, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Mention "alarm" or "wake me up" followed by the time, such as 9:30 PM or 2 hours from now. Optionally, mention if you want it to occur on a specific day, such as "Monday." Siri displays the alarm so that you can verify that it's accurate, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.9</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer158">
					<img alt="Figure 6.9 – Siri displaying the alarm it has set&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.09_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.9 – Siri displaying the alarm it has set</p>
			<p>Once you've set an<a id="_idIndexMarker380"/> alarm, you may later want to edit that alarm. To modify an existing alarm, you need to tell Siri the time of the alarm and then specify a new time and/or day, such as "Change my 1:45 alarm to 2:15." </p>
			<p>Rather than editing<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> the time of an alarm, you can also turn off (or on) an alarm by saying "Turn on/off" followed by the time of your alarm, such as "2:00 PM alarm."</p>
			<p>To edit an existing alarm, follow these<a id="_idIndexMarker382"/> steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>State the alarm time you want to edit (such as "Change my 1:30 alarm") followed by the new time. Siri acknowledges your change verbally and shows the new alarm time. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sometimes, you may create an alarm and later decide you don't need it anymore. One option is to turn off or disable the alarm. Another option is to delete the alarm altogether.</p>
			<p>To delete or disable an alarm, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>State the alarm time you want to edit (such as "my 1:30 alarm") preceded by "turn off," "disable," or "delete," which will be "turn off/disable/delete my 1:30 alarm." Siri acknowledges your change. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Alarms can be handy when you want to be alerted at a specific time, such as 1:30 PM. For another way to alert you when time passes, set a timer through Siri.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor292"/>Setting a timer</h2>
			<p>While alarms are <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>handy for alerting you when it gets to a specific time, you might also want to set a timer to let you know when a specific amount of time has passed, such as 5 or 10 minutes. By setting alarms and timers, you can make sure you never miss a meeting or overcook your food again.</p>
			<p>To set a timer, say "Set a timer" or "Start a timer" followed by the amount of time you want, such as 10 minutes. Once a timer has started, you can also use Siri to pause, check, stop, or resume the timer by using phrases such as "Pause the timer" or "Resume the timer."</p>
			<p>To set a timer, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>State that you want to start or set a timer followed by the length of time, such as 20 minutes. Siri displays your timer information as it counts down, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.10</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer159">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.10 – Setting a timer through Siri</p>
			<p>You can use timers to measure a time period, such as the time to boil an egg or do an exercise workout. Similar to timers are reminders, which can be more useful when you want to be notified of an event further on in the future, such as a day, week, or month<a id="_idTextAnchor293"/><a id="_idTextAnchor294"/> from now.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor295"/>Setting a reminder</h2>
			<p>The moment <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>you learn of an upcoming event, create a reminder. Reminders will pop up on your iPhone screen to notify you of a particular event, such as calling someone at a specific time. Reminders are similar to alarms, but alarms are linked to a specific time (such as 12:10 AM) while reminders can be linked to a date in the future, such as two days from now or next week.</p>
			<p>To create a reminder with Siri, simply use the word "Remind" followed by the event and time, such as "next week," "on May 12," or "in 1 hour." Since your iPhone can track your location, you can also create a reminder to occur when you get to work or home. </p>
			<p>To set a reminder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>State that you want to set a<a id="_idIndexMarker385"/> reminder by using the "Remind" word followed by an event and time, such as "tomorrow." Siri displays your reminder, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.11</em>. Your reminder now appears in the Rem<a id="_idTextAnchor296"/><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/><a id="_idTextAnchor298"/><a id="_idTextAnchor299"/>inders app:</li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.11 – Setting a reminder with Siri</p>
			<p>Once you've set a reminder, you can delete it through Siri or manually by opening up the Reminders app.</p>
			<p>To delete a reminder through Siri, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>State the reminder you want to delete by stating a distinctive word used in the reminder followed by the "reminder" word. Siri displays the reminder it thinks you want to delete, as shown in <em class="italic">Fi<a id="_idTextAnchor300"/><a id="_idTextAnchor301"/>gure 6.12</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer161"><img alt="Figure 6.12 – Deleting a reminder&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.12 – Deleting a reminder</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">No</strong> or <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Reminders are one way to keep track of <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>upcoming events, but another way is to store upcoming appointments in the Calendar app.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102">Setting a<a id="_idTextAnchor302"/><a id="_idTextAnchor303"/><a id="_idTextAnchor304"/>n appointment</h2>
			<p>The Calendar app not only lets <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>you see upcoming dates for the year, but it's also handy for storing future appointments on specific dates, such as doctor's appointments, business meetings, or important phone calls. </p>
			<p>Rather than wasting time opening the Calendar app and checking your appointments for a particular day, it's much easier to let Siri remind you instead. Simply ask Siri "What's on my calendar?" or "What does my day look like?" and then choose a specific day, such as "today" or "May 13th." </p>
			<p>To check your calendar, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Ask a question referencing "calendar" or "day" and a specific date. Siri displays a list of all appointments scheduled for that day, as shown in <em class="italic">F<a id="_idTextAnchor305"/><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/>igure 6.13</em>:</li>

			<p>Seeing a list of scheduled <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>appointments for a particular day can help you plan that day. However, you might also want to add, edit, or delete appointments as well. While you can do that manually through the Calendar app, you can also let Siri do it for you as well.</p>
			<p>To schedule an appointment, say the words "appointment" or "meeting" to Siri, describe the meeting, such as "Meet with Dr. Gillian," and state a time and date, such as "August 8th at 10 AM."</p>
			<p>To create an appointment for your calendar, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Make a statement using the words "meeting" or "schedule," describe the meeting, and give a specific date and time. Siri displays your meeting, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.14</em>. If Siri needs more information, such as the time, date, or clarification on which person you want to meet (in case two people share similar names), an additional Siri screen will appear asking "What time is your appointment?" or something similar:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer163"><img alt="Figure 6.14 – Siri scheduling an appointment&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.14 – Siri scheduling an appointment</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> or <strong class="bold">Confirm</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've set up a meeting, you can always change<a id="_idIndexMarker389"/> the meeting to another time or date, or you can delete it altogether. </p>
			<p>To move or change an appointment, use the words "Change" or Move" followed by "meeting" or "appointment" and specify a new time and date, such as "Move my 9:00 PM meeting with John to next Friday at 10:30 AM." </p>
			<p>If you want to edit an appointment without providing enough information, Siri will ask for clarification, such as when you want to reschedule the meeting. </p>
			<p>To move or change an appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Make a statement using the words "Change" or "Move" followed by identifying a "meeting" or "appointment." Then, give another time and date. If Siri needs more information, a message appears on the screen. When Siri has enough information to change an appointment, it displays the modified appointment, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.15</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer164"><img alt="Figure 6.15 – Siri changing an appointment&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.15 – Siri changing an appointment</p></li>

			<p>To remove an <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Make a statement using the words "Cancel," "Remove," or "Delete" followed by identifying a "meeting" or "appointment" on a specific time and date.

When Siri has enough information to change an appointment, it asks you to verify removing the appointment, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.16</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer165"><img alt="Figure 6.16 – Siri deleting an appointment&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.16_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.16 – Siri deleting an appointment</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">No</strong> or <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. If Siri misunderstood you, tap the <strong class="bold">Tap to Edit</strong> button and edit the text that Siri thinks you said. That way, you can fix any errors or confusion.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Appointments often take <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>place in specific locations, so once you know what day and time you need to be somewhere, you might also need directions for how to get there.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor309"/>Getting directions</h2>
			<p>To get directions, Siri has to know<a id="_idIndexMarker393"/> where you want to start and where you want to go. If you omit a starting location, Siri will assume your current location is your starting location. Once you identify a destination, Siri can display the Maps app with directions.</p>
			<p>To get directions, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Ask a question using the words "directions" or "get" followed by a starting location and an ending destination. Siri will open the Maps app with directions, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.17</em>. From this screen, you can choose driving, walking, transit, and cycling directions:</li>
			</ol>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.17 – Getting directions with Siri</p>
			<p>Rather than get directions, you might be <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>more interested in traffic around a certain area. By knowing whether traffic is light or heavy, you can choose the best route to your destination.</p>
			<p>To get traffic information, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Ask a question using the words "traffic" followed by a location, such as "near me" or "in Chicago." Siri will open the Maps app and identify areas o<a id="_idTextAnchor310"/><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>f heavy traffic.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Finding traffic jams or bottlenecks near you can be handy, but you can also use Siri to look for specific places nearby, such as finding a gas station or a Thai restaurant close by.</p>
			<p>To find the location of a business or place, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Ask a question using the word "near" followed by the location or business you want, such as "What <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>Brazilian restaurants are near me?" If you omit specifying a location, Siri will assume you want to use your current location. Siri displays a list of options, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.18</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer167">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.18 – Finding locations nearby</p>
			<p>When you're going to a specific location, you may want to meet others. You could call or text people, but it's often easier to let Siri help you so that you don't have to go through the steps manually, which can be especially useful if you're in cold weather and don't want to take your gloves off to tap your iPhone screen.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104">Sending and receivi<a id="_idTextAnchor312"/><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/>ng text messages</h2>
			<p>Typing on the virtual <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>keyboard of the iPhone can be clumsy for<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> some people, especially if you want to text someone while wearing gloves in cold climates. That's when it's much easier to send a text message with Siri's help instead.</p>
			<p>Siri can also be handy for reading text messages to you out loud. That way, you can reference a previous message before replying with your own. You can have Siri read the last text message you received (regardless of who sent it) or you can specify the last text message from a specific person.</p>
			<p>To have Siri read text messages, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Give Siri a command using the words "read" and "text message." Optionally, describe the person whose text messages you want to read. That person's name and mobile phone number must be stored in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. Siri reads the message and asks, "Would you like to reply?"</li>
				<li>Say "Yes." Siri will ask, "What do you want to say?" and displays a text message bubble, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.19</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer168"><img alt="Figure 6.19 – Siri displaying a text message bubble for your reply&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.19_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.19 – Siri displaying a text message bubble for your reply</p></li>
				<li>Dictate your reply. Siri displays your message along with the <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> and <strong class="bold">Send</strong> buttons, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.20</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer169"><img alt="Figure 6.20 – Getting ready to send a text message&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.20_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.20 – Getting ready to send a text message</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> or <strong class="bold">Send</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You might also want to <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>send a text message to someone<a id="_idIndexMarker399"/> without reading any text messages. That's when you can simply state "Send text message" followed by a specific person or mobile phone number. Then, Siri will prompt you for a message to send.</p>
			<p>To avoid this prompt, you can say "Send text" or "Send text message" followed by a specific person or mobile phone number, and the actual message, such as "Send text to Bob, What time can you be at my place?"</p>
			<p>To send a text message, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Give Siri a command using the words "Send text" or "Send text message" followed by the person or mobile phone number. Optionally, include the message you want to send. If you do not include a message, Siri will prompt you to add a message.</li>
				<li>Siri displays your text message along with a <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> and <strong class="bold">Send</strong> button (see <em class="italic">Figure 6.20</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> or <strong class="bold">Send</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sending text messages through Siri can be handy, but sometimes you may want to talk to a person directly. That's when you can use Siri to help you make phone calls.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>Making phone calls</h2>
			<p>To make a<a id="_idIndexMarker400"/> phone call with Siri, you must specify a mobile phone number to call or a person's name already stored in your <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. </p>
			<p>To make a call, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Give Siri a command using the word "Call" followed by the person or mobile phone number. Your iPhone starts dialing <a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>your chosen number.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Making a call with Siri simply opens the Phone app. Of course, you can use Siri to open any app on your iPhone.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>Opening an app</h2>
			<p>You might have an<a id="_idIndexMarker401"/> app that you want to use, but it can be a nuisance to open the Home Screen and scroll through different icons to find the app you want to use. As a shortcut, just ask Siri to open a specific app for you by stating "Open" followed by the name of the app, such as "Calculator app."</p>
			<p>To open an app, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Give Siri a command using the word "Open" followed by the app name, such as "Calculator app." Your chosen app appears on the screen.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>One app that many people use frequently is the Music app so that they can play their favorite songs. While you can just ask Siri to open the Music app, you might want to specify a specific song as well.</p>
			<p>To open the Music app and play a song stored in your music library, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Give Siri a command using the words "Play" and "song" followed by the name of the song you want to hear. Siri opens the Music app and starts playing your chosen song.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>By using Siri to control the Music app, you won't have to search through your music library manually to find the song you want. While<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> listening to music can be fun, you might also want to play with a neat Siri trick to check for commercial flights above your current location.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Tracking flights above you</h2>
			<p>At any given moment, there <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>will be several commercial airplanes flying overhead. Just for fun, you can ask Siri about these flights and get a variety of information, such as the airline, flight number, altitude, and even the type of plane. </p>
			<p>To find out what flights are above you, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start Siri (by pressing the Side button or saying "Hey Siri"). </li>
				<li>Ask Siri "What flights are above me?" Siri displays the results, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.21</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer170">
					<img alt="Figure 6.21 – Getting information about flights above your current location&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_6.21_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.21 – Getting information about flights above your current location</p>
			<p>Viewing flights above you<a id="_idIndexMarker404"/> can be interesting just to make you realize how many planes are flying over your current location at any time.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Think of having a courteous servant ready to obey your voice commands at all times, and that's what Siri can do for you and your iPhone. Not everyone may need Siri to play music, but chances are good that you use your iPhone for common tasks that can be made easier by relying on Siri. </p>
			<p>Practice using different words and phrases to see which ones work most accurately with Siri. Depending on your pronunciation, some words and phrases may work better than others. Siri is handy when you can't use your hands to manually control your iPhone.</p>
			<p>While Siri can control most features of your iPhone, the one feature that requires your complete attention is taking pictures through the iPhone's camera, which is the subject of the next chapter. </p>
