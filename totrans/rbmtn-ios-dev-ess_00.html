Today people are spending considerable amounts of time on smart devices instead of PCs, which is generating an unprecedented amount of revenue that no industry has ever seen. Despite this, it still fits in your pocket.</p><p>So far the application development scene for the iOS ecosystem has been dominated by Objective-C. However, with the introduction of the revolutionary RubyMotion tool chain, Ruby developers are no longer outcasts for creating pure native iOS applications. They can make use of every bit of the all-powerful iOS SDK; and the best part is this can be done without using Xcode.</p><p>Both Ruby and RubyMotion are the brainchild of folks who wanted to simplify things in a complex world. <span class="emphasis"><em>Yukihiro Matsumoto</em></span> (also known as <span class="emphasis"><em>Matz</em></span>) is credited for creating the Ruby programming language, which is often regarded as a developer's best friend. And <span class="emphasis"><em>Laurent Sansonetti</em></span> is credited for creating the ground-breaking tool chain, RubyMotion.</p><p>RubyMotion iOS Development Essentials will appeal to a developer's mind, especially to the technocrats looking for a reliable tool chain for iOS development. This book] is a step-by-step guide to build an iOS application from scratch to deployment.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
