		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-236"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor519"/>Chapter 14</em>: Setting Appointments and Reminders</h1>
			<p>Most people need to be somewhere at a certain time and a certain date. This might be a doctor's appointment, a job interview, a train or plane trip, or just meeting a friend for drinks or lunch. Since nearly everyone needs to keep track of their schedule, you might as well use your iPhone to help you keep track of various appointments you need to keep at certain times and dates in the future.</p>
			<p>By storing all your appointments on your iPhone, you won't risk forgetting something important. Even better, you can set reminders so your iPhone can beep to let you know in advance when an appointment is coming up. That way you can prepare in advance.</p>
			<p>The topics this chapter covers are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting appointments</li>
				<li>Editing and deleting an appointment</li>
				<li>Setting reminders and travel time</li>
				<li>Defining recurring appointments</li>
				<li>Adding meeting locations</li>
				<li>Inviting others to an appointment</li>
				<li>Adding notes to an appointment </li>
				<li>Deleting an appointment </li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor520"/><a id="_idTextAnchor521"/><a id="_idTextAnchor522"/><a id="_idTextAnchor523"/>Setting appointments</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app is where you can<a id="_idIndexMarker803"/> store your appointments and view them again. With each appointment, you need to define a date, a time, and a brief description of that appointment such as "Dentist appointment" or "Lunch with Joan." Optionally, you can also define a location, any additional people you want to invite, reminder alerts, notes, or files related to the appointment. </p>
			<p>Once you set an appointment, you can view it on the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app. That way, each morning, you can check the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app for your appointments that day.</p>
			<p>To set an<a id="_idIndexMarker804"/> appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap a date for your appointment, such as June 24 or December 5.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. A <strong class="bold">New Event</strong> screen appears as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.1</em>:<a id="_idTextAnchor524"/><a id="_idTextAnchor525"/><div><img alt="Figure 14.1 – The New Event screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.1 – The New Event screen</p></li>
				<li>Click in the <strong class="bold">Title</strong> text field and type a description of your appointment such as "Pick up Fred from airport" or "Meet Sally for lunch."</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Starts</strong> button. A date and time picker appears as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.2</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 14.2 – The New Event screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.2 – The New Event screen</p></li>
				<li>Set a time. You can also<a id="_idIndexMarker805"/> change the date if you wish. Scroll down and make sure the <strong class="bold">Time Zone</strong> option is correct for your part of the world. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Ends</strong>. Another date and time picker appears, letting you set the estimated ending time.</li>
				<li>Set an ending time. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Add</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you have added an appointment, you can tap on the date of that appointment in the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app to view all appointments for that day as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.3</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 14.3 – Viewing all appointments for a particular day&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.03_B14100.jpg"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.3 – Viewing all appointments for a particular day</p>
			<p>After you have set an<a id="_idIndexMarker806"/> appointment, you may later want to modify it if you need to change its time or date, or delete the appointment altogether.<a id="_idTextAnchor526"/><a id="_idTextAnchor527"/></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor528"/>Editing and deleting an appointment</h1>
			<p>Appointments can<a id="_idIndexMarker807"/> always change so you need to modify them if necessary. That could mean <a id="_idIndexMarker808"/>changing the time, date, or even deleting it altogether. Fortunately, you can edit any appointment just as easily as you created it in the first place. </p>
			<p>To edit an existing appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap a date that contains the appointment you want to edit. A list of appointments for that day appears under the calendar (see <em class="italic">Figure 14.3</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the appointment you want to edit. An <strong class="bold">Event Details</strong> screen appears as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.4</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 14.4 – An Event Details screen for viewing an appointment&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.4 – An Event Details screen for viewing an appointmen<a id="_idTextAnchor529"/><a id="_idTextAnchor530"/>t</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen. An <strong class="bold">Edit Event</strong> screen appears where you can edit all<a id="_idIndexMarker809"/> details about the appointmen<a id="_idTextAnchor531"/><a id="_idTextAnchor532"/>t.</li>
				<li>Change any details you <a id="_idIndexMarker810"/>wish, such as the starting time, ending time, description, or date.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Event Details</strong> screen appears again so you can verify all the details of your appointment are correct. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Back</strong> button in the upper-left corner to return to the calendar. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Editing an appointment can be useful when you need to change details, but you may need to delete an appointment altogether once you no longer need it.</p>
			<p>To delete an appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap a date that contains the appointment you want to edit. A list of appointments for that day appears under the calendar (see <em class="italic">Figure 14.3</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the appointment you want to edit. An <strong class="bold">Event Details</strong> screen appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 14.4</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete Event</strong> at the bottom of the screen. A <strong class="bold">Delete Event</strong> and <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> button appear at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete Event</strong>. Your chosen appointment disappears.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Setting, editing, and deleting appointments are the basics for helping you keep track of where you need to be at any given time on any given day. For more flexibility, you may want to look at some additional features for setting appointments.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-239"><a id="_idTextAnchor533"/>Setting reminders and travel time</h1>
			<p>Setting an appointment won't do <a id="_idIndexMarker811"/>you any good if you forget about it. Even if you look at the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app to see your appointments for the day, you still might forget about it when the appointment time comes.</p>
			<p>For that reason, you<a id="_idIndexMarker812"/> might want to set reminders. A reminder lets your iPhone alert you before your appointment occurs. That way you can have enough time to travel and prepare for any upcoming appointments. </p>
			<p>You can set reminders when you create an appointment, or you can add a reminder to an existing appointment. In either case, reminders help ensure you don't forget your appointment as long as you have your iPhone nearby.  </p>
			<p>Another feature you may want to add to an appointment is travel time. Just because an appointment starts at 11:00 a.m. doesn't help you if it will take you 20 minutes to get there and you don't realize this until it's 10:50 a.m.</p>
			<p>To set travel time, follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Either create a new appointment or edit an existing one.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Travel Time</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Travel Time</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Travel Time</strong> switch to on so a list of times appears as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.5</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 14.5 – The Travel Time screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.5 – The Travel Time screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap a length <a id="_idIndexMarker813"/>of time such as <strong class="bold">15 minutes</strong> or <strong class="bold">30 minutes</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Edit Event</strong> back<a id="_idIndexMarker814"/> button in the upper-left corner of the screen. Your chosen travel time now appears on the <strong class="bold">Travel Time</strong> row.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>After defining a travel time, you'll see that the travel time is displayed in your appointment on the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.6</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 14.6 – Travel time appearing in an appointment&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.06_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.6 – Travel time appearing in an appointment</p>
			<p>Setting travel time can be handy to let you know what time you need to leave to get to your appointment. However, you may still also want to set a reminder, otherwise you risk forgetting <a id="_idIndexMarker815"/>about the travel time and your appointment.</p>
			<p>To set a reminder, follow these <a id="_idIndexMarker816"/>steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Either create a new appointment or edit an existing one.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Alert</strong>. An <strong class="bold">Alert</strong> screen appears as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.7</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 14.7 – An Alert screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.07_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.7 – An Alert screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap a time when you want to be informed before your appointment. If you defined a travel<a id="_idIndexMarker817"/> time, your alert will remind you before the start of the travel time you defined. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>At the time of your<a id="_idIndexMarker818"/> reminder, you'll hear an audio alert along with a notification either at the top of the screen (if your iPhone is unlocked) or in the middle of the screen (if your iPhone is locked) as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.8</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 14.8 – A reminder for an upcoming appointment&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.08_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.8 – A reminder for an upcoming appointment</p>
			<p>Reminders can<a id="_idIndexMarker819"/> make sure you don't miss an appointment or start traveling there<a id="_idIndexMarker820"/> too late to make it on time. While most appointments occur once, such as a doctor's appointment, others may occur regularly, such as a weekly meeting at work, so you need to know how to define those types of appointments as well. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-240"><a id="_idTextAnchor534"/>Defining recurring appointments</h1>
			<p>If you need to schedule an <a id="_idIndexMarker821"/>appointment that occurs regularly, such as every Friday afternoon, you could set that appointment once and then keep editing it to change its date to the next Friday. However, if you forget to do this, you'll risk not posting your appointment on the next date and could miss it. </p>
			<p>A far better solution is to define a recurring appointment. Just tell the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app how often you want an appointment to occur, such as every week or every month, and then you'll just need to set this appointment once. The <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app will then automatically keep posting new times for your appointment until you either edit or delete this appointment.</p>
			<p>To create a recurring appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Either create a new appointment or edit an existing one.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Repeat</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Repeat</strong> screen appears as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.9</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 14.9 – The Repeat screen lets you define a recurring appointment&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.9 – The Repeat screen lets you define a recurring appointment</p></li>
				<li>Tap a time interval for your appointment to repeat, such as every week or every month.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. Now your<a id="_idIndexMarker822"/> appointment will automatically occur on the time intervals you specified.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Besides setting a time and date for a meeting, you may also want to specify a location. That way you'll know where to go when the meeting occurs. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-241"><a id="_idTextAnchor535"/>Adding meeting locations</h1>
			<p>Many meetings<a id="_idIndexMarker823"/> occur in familiar locations such as a conference room or a favorite coffee house. However, sometimes you may need to schedule an appointment at an unfamiliar place. In that case, you may want to define a meeting location with your appointment as well. That way you'll know where to go for your appointment.</p>
			<p>To define a location for an appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Either create a new appointment or edit an existing one.</li>
				<li>Tap in the <strong class="bold">Location</strong> text field at the top of the screen. A <strong class="bold">Location</strong> screen appears as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.10</em>, listing the most recent locations you searched for in the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> app: <div><img alt="Figure 14.10 – The Location screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.10_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.10 – The Location screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap a location or type a description or address in the <strong class="bold">Enter Location</strong> text field at the top of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. If you are <a id="_idIndexMarker824"/>setting a location for a recurring appointment, you'll see additional options for setting a location for the current appointment or all future events as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.11</em>. Tap the <strong class="bold">Save for future events</strong> option:</li>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.11 – Verifying whether you want to set a location for a recurring appointment</p>
			<p>Many appointments<a id="_idIndexMarker825"/> involve several people, so you may want to notify those people that you expect them at an upcoming appointment as well.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-242"><a id="_idTextAnchor536"/>Inviting others to an appointment</h1>
			<p>Oftentimes, an appointment may need other people to attend. So when creating or editing an appointment, you can add a list of people who should be at your meeting and then contact them to verify that<a id="_idIndexMarker826"/> they'll be there as well.</p>
			<p>To invite others to an appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Either create a new appointment or edit an existing one.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Invitees</strong>. An <strong class="bold">Add Invitees</strong> screen appears as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.12</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 14.12 – The Add Invitees screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.12 – The Add Invitees screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on a name to invite them to attend your meeting. </li>
				<li>Repeat <em class="italic">Steps 4</em> and <em class="italic">5</em> for each<a id="_idIndexMarker827"/> additional person you want to invite to the meeting.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Invitees</strong> screen now lists all the people you invited to the meeting as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.13</em>:</li>

			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">With Microsoft Exchange and other servers, you can send someone an invitation to a meeting even if you didn't originally schedule that appointment. </p>
			<p>If you want to remove someone from an<a id="_idIndexMarker828"/> appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the meeting that you want to remove some invited people from.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Invitees</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Invitees</strong> screen appears listing all the people you've invited.</li>
				<li>Swipe left on the name of the person you want to remove from the meeting. A <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> button appears on the right as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.14</em> (A <strong class="bold">Make Optional</strong> button also appears if you want to identify someone's attendance as optional for a meeting):<div><img alt="Figure 14.14 – Deleting a person from an appointment&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.14 – Deleting a person from an appointment</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>When you set an appointment, you <a id="_idIndexMarker829"/>may want to include notes or other reference materials. That way you'll know what you should review or have with you for an appointment.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-243"><a id="_idTextAnchor537"/>Adding notes to an appointment</h1>
			<p>If you have a doctor's appointment, you<a id="_idIndexMarker830"/> might want to bring a list of concerns you have about certain symptoms or drugs. If you have a business appointment, you<a id="_idIndexMarker831"/> might want to review notes about what you want to accomplish and information about the person or people you'll be meeting. </p>
			<p>In many cases, an appointment may require notes for you to review ahead of time or to take with you to use during the appointment. You may want to use one or more of the following ways to attach notes to an appointment:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Type text.</li>
				<li>Attach a file.</li>
				<li>Add a URL (website address).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Typing additional text can remind you of things to bring to an appointment that you don't want to forget, or provide you with information you'll need during the appointment. </p>
			<p>Attaching a file lets you include a document you may have created using a word processor such as Pages or a spreadsheet such as Numbers. This lets you review the file before or during the appointment.</p>
			<p>Adding a URL lets you reference information stored on a website such as useful information that you may need to achieve the goals of your appointment. For example, a sales appointment might link to a company website so you can review or show information during a sales presentation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor538"/>Typing text on an appointment</h2>
			<p>Every appointment<a id="_idIndexMarker832"/> provides a <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> text field where you can type any information you wish regarding an upcoming appointment. For example, if you're going to a job interview, you might want to jot down notes to remind you what to bring or what to review before the interview.</p>
			<p>To type text as a note for an <a id="_idIndexMarker833"/>appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Either create a new appointment or edit an existing one.</li>
				<li>Scroll down and tap in the <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> text field as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.15</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 14.15 – The Notes text field in an appointment&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.15 – The Notes text field in an appointment</p></li>
				<li>Type any information you want to regarding the appointment.</li>
				<li>Tape <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Notes</strong> text field is handy<a id="_idIndexMarker834"/> for typing text, but if you already have information stored in a separate file, it's easier just to attach that file to the appointment instead.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor539"/>Attaching files to an appointment</h2>
			<p>You may have <a id="_idIndexMarker835"/>several files that you've created using Keynote, Pages, or any app that creates files. If a particular file is important for your appointment, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker836"/> attach that file to the appointment. </p>
			<p>To attach a file to an appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Either create a new appointment or edit an existing one.</li>
				<li>Scroll down and tap <strong class="bold">Add attachment</strong> (see <em class="italic">Figure 14.15</em>). A <strong class="bold">Recents</strong> screen appears, listing all the recent files on your iPhone as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.16</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 14.16 – The Recents screen shows recently opened files&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.16_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.16 – The Recents screen shows recently opened files</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Browse</strong> icon at the<a id="_idIndexMarker837"/> bottom of the screen. A <strong class="bold">Browse</strong> screen<a id="_idIndexMarker838"/> appears, letting you browse for other files to attach to an appointment as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.17</em>:<p class="figure-caption"> </p><div><img alt="Figure 14.17 – Searching for a location to find a file&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.17 – Searching for a location to find a file</p></li>
				<li>Tap a<a id="_idIndexMarker839"/> location such as <strong class="bold">iCloud Drive</strong> or <strong class="bold">On My iPhone</strong>. An additional <a id="_idIndexMarker840"/>screen appears, listing folders of files created by different apps as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.18</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 14.18 – Browsing files to attach to an appointment&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.18 – Browsing files to attach to an appointment</p></li>
				<li>Tap on a file that you <a id="_idIndexMarker841"/>want to attach to an appointment.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you attach a file to an <a id="_idIndexMarker842"/>appointment, you can always remove that file from the appointment by left swiping on the file to display a <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> button. Then tap <strong class="bold">Remove</strong>.</p>
			<p>An attached file can remind you of a file to open (using the app that created it) before or during an appointment. A third way<a id="_idIndexMarker843"/> to reference information in an <a id="_idIndexMarker844"/>appointment is by storing a URL address.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor540"/>Attaching URLs to an appointment</h2>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">URL</strong> (<strong class="bold">Uniform Resource Locator</strong>) commonly<a id="_idIndexMarker845"/> identifies a website address. By linking a website address to an appointment, you can have a reference to<a id="_idIndexMarker846"/> review before or during an appointment.</p>
			<p>To attach a URL to an appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Either create a new appointment or edit an existing one.</li>
				<li>Scroll down and tap in the <strong class="bold">URL</strong> text field (see <em class="italic">Figure 14.15</em>). </li>
				<li>Type a website address such as <a href="http://www.apple.com">www.apple.com</a>. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you add a website address to an appointment, you can tap on that website address to open it in the Safari browser. Of course, after you create an appointment, you'll probably want to delete it eventually after it's done. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor541"/>Deleting an appointment</h1>
			<p>When you're finished with <a id="_idIndexMarker847"/>an appointment, you can delete it to keep your calendar uncluttered. To delete an appointment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the appointment you want to delete.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete Event</strong> at the bottom of the screen. An action sheet appears at the bottom of the screen, giving you a choice of deleting the appointment or not. If you are deleting a recurring appointment, you'll have the option of deleting just that one occurrence of the appointment or all recurring instances of that appointment as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.19</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 14.19 – Verifying that you want to delete an appointment&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_14.19_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 14.19 – Verifying that you want to delete an appointment</p></li>

			<p>Everyone needs to keep track of times and dates when they need to be somewhere or do something. Rather than rely on your memory or a paper calendar or meeting planner, it's far easier to rely on your iPhone instead. </p>
			<p>Any time you have an appointment, put it in your calendar so you won't forget it. For an extra reminder, set an alert to remind you about the appointment ahead of time so you won't be late.</p>
			<p>To help you during an appointment, consider typing notes, attaching files, or including website addresses that you can reference before or during an appointment. The more prepared you are for an appointment, the more likely it will achieve the results you want.</p>
			<p>In addition to setting appointments with others, be sure to set aside time for yourself to relax or pursue your own projects. By defining time for you to achieve projects you want to do, you can increase the chances that you'll have time to do them.</p>
			<p>Appointments can be useful when meeting with others. When you're alone, you may come up with ideas and that's when you need to know how to store your ideas as both text and audio recordings, so you don't forget them.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how iPhone helps us to write notes and record voice memos. </p>
