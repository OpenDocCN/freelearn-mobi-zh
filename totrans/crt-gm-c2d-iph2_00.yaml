- en: Cocos2d for iPhone is a robust framework for developing 2D games for any iOS
    device. It is powerful, flexible, and best of all it is free to use for your own
    projects. Thousands of apps, including many top selling games, have been written
    using cocos2d.

- en: '*Creating Games with cocos2d for iPhone 2* will take you on a tour of nine
    very different games, guiding you through the designing process and code needed
    to build each game. All of the games were specifically selected to highlight different
    approaches to solving the challenges inherent in designing a game.'

- en: The games covered in this book are all classic game styles. By focusing on games
    you probably already know, you can see how everything works "under the hood" with
    cocos2d.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Thanks for the Memory Game"), *Thanks for
    the Memory Game*, covers the design and building of a memory tile game. It covers
    basic concepts such as grid layouts, using cocos2d actions, and using CocosDenshion
    for sound effects.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Match 3 and Recursive Methods"), *Match 3
    and Recursive Methods*, walks through the design and building of a match-3 game.
    This chapter covers two different approaches to checking for matches, as well
    as an extensive section on predictive matching and how to generate artificial
    randomness.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Thumping Moles for Fun"), *Thumping Moles
    for Fun*, provides the basic concepts of how to design a mole thumping game. This
    game uses Z-ordering to "trick the eye", and uses cocos2d actions extensively
    to give a very polished game with very little coding needed.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Give a Snake a Snack…"), *Give a Snake a
    Snack...*, follows the design and building of a snake game. Some of the topics
    covered in this chapter include overriding methods, making sprites follow each
    other, and implementing increasing difficulty levels.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Brick Breaking Balls with Box2D"), *Brick
    Breaking Balls with Box2D*, covers the building of a brick-breaking game using
    the Box2D physics engine. In this chapter, you will find a basic primer on how
    to use Box2D, using plists to store level data, and implementing power-ups.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Cycles of Light"), *Cycles of Light*, takes
    us to an iPad only multiplayer game. This game allows two players to compete head-to-head
    on the same iPad, or by using GameKit''s Bluetooth connectivity to play against
    each other on two iPads. This chapter also walks through how we can use a single
    pixel to draw almost everything in the game.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Playing Pool, Old School"), *Playing Pool,
    Old School*, revisits the Box2D physics engine to build a top-down pool game.
    The focus on this chapter is to implement a simple "rules engine" into the game,
    as well as how to easily build multiple control methods into the same game.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Shoot, Scroll, Shoot Again"), *Shoot, Scroll,
    Shoot Again*, walks through the building of a top-down scrolling shooter. This
    chapter walks you through how to use readily available outside tools and resources,
    including Sneaky Joystick and the Tiled tile map editor. It also covers two different
    forms of enemy AI, including A* Pathfinding.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Running and Running and Running..."), *Running
    and Running and Running...*, brings us to the most ambitious game of all, the
    endless runner. The primary topics covered are how to create random terrain that
    characters can walk on, parallax scrolling backgrounds, and implementing a lot
    of different types of enemies.'

    to be enrolled in the Apple's iOS Developer program. You will be able to run the
    games in the iOS Simulator without enrolling, but the tilt controls in [Chapter
    8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Shoot, Scroll, Shoot Again"), *Shoot, Scroll, Shoot Again*
    and the Bluetooth multiplayer mode in [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Cycles

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is written for people who have basic experience with cocos2d, but
    want some guidance on how to approach real-world design issues. Although the book
    does revisit some basic concepts, we hit the ground running, so having a basic
    understanding of cocos2d is recommended. At least some knowledge of Objective-C
    is also strongly recommended.
