- en: 'At this point, we have covered a lot in the book. Swift is not a small topic
    and app development itself is orders of magnitude bigger than that. We learned
    most of Swift but it would not have been practical to cover every little feature
    of the language and Swift is still a new and evolving language. You are never
    going to be able to keep everything you''ve learned in your memory without being
    able to refer to it later. You can always refer back to this book but Apple''s
    documentation can be a great reference too. Beyond that, if you truly want to
    become a proficient Swift developer, you can ensure your success by always learning
    and evolving. It is extremely hard to do that in a vacuum. The best way to ensure
    that you are keeping up with the times is to follow and participate in the community
    around whatever topics interest you the most. In this chapter, we will go over
    how to use Apple''s documentation and some suggestions on where you can find and
    participate in the Swift, iOS, and OS X developer community. More specifically,
    in this chapter we will cover:'

  zh: 到目前为止，我们在书中已经涵盖了大量的内容。Swift不是一个小的主题，而应用开发本身比这大得多。我们学习了Swift的大部分内容，但涵盖语言的所有小特性并不实用，而且Swift仍然是一个新且不断发展的语言。您永远不可能在不参考的情况下记住您所学的一切。您始终可以参考这本书，但苹果的文档也可以作为一个很好的参考。除此之外，如果您真正想成为一名熟练的Swift开发者，您可以通过始终学习和进步来确保您的成功。在没有外界帮助的情况下做到这一点是非常困难的。确保您跟上时代的最佳方式是关注并参与您最感兴趣的任何主题的社区。在本章中，我们将介绍如何使用苹果的文档，以及一些关于您可以在哪里找到并参与Swift、iOS和OS
    X开发者社区的建议。更具体地说，在本章中，我们将涵盖以下内容：

    ways you can look at the documentation is within the **Quick Help** inspector.
    You can display it by navigating to **View** | **Utilities** | **Show Quick Help

    help with regards to it, as shown in the following screenshot:'

    parts of the framework you need to use for a particular task. You can then use
    this documentation to figure out the specifics of how to properly use that part
    of the framework. As you get better acquainted with Apple's frameworks, this will
    become more useful, because it is relatively easy to remember what parts of the
    framework you use for all of the common tasks, but it is far more difficult and
    often impractical to remember exactly how they work. However, sometimes the documentation
    is not enough. The next place you should look for answers is online.

    someone has already written about it somewhere. Before you jump right to asking
    a question on a forum, I strongly recommend that you do your own searching. First
    of all, you want to save the valuable time of the community members. If they are
    constantly answering the same questions over and over again, they are dedicating
    a lot less time to truly new questions. Second, you will often find that you discover
    the answer for yourself in the process of formulating your thoughts, on how to
    search for it. Lastly, you will become much better at searching for programming
    related problems as you practice it more. Forums are usually going to be very
    slow compared to finding your own answer and obviously time is money.

- en: Blog posts can also be great for extremely in-depth and nuanced problems. For
    example, there are some major and complicated repercussions of our move from 32-bit
    to 64-bit processors. Truly understanding the underlying problem will be far more
    valuable for you in moving forward than finding a quick solution for your immediate

    Asking good questions is just as important as answering questions well. These
    sites act not only as a way to get an answer to a new question but as living documentation

    to allow someone with more knowledge than you to hone in on the exact problem
    instead of wasting time on things you could figure out on your own. This will
    often mean describing all of the things you have tried already and what roadblocks
    you hit. The clearer you make it that you have put real effort into solving the
    problem yourself, the better reception you will get from the community and also
    better answers. I cannot even count all the times that I have figured out the
    solution to a problem while I was writing up a question on a forum. This type
    of solution is going to be far more memorable and long lasting than a solution
    that someone else gives you.

  zh: 最后一点是最重要的。您希望将问题表述得让比您知识更丰富的人能够精确地锁定问题，而不是浪费时间在您自己可以解决的问题上。这通常意味着描述您已经尝试过的所有事情以及您遇到的障碍。您越清楚地表明您已经投入了真正的努力来解决该问题，您从社区那里得到的反响和答案就会越好。我甚至无法计算我在论坛上撰写问题时解决了多少问题。这种类型的解决方案将比别人给出的解决方案更容易记住，并且更持久。

  zh: 摘要
- en: The short length of this chapter is in stark contrast to its importance. If
    there is one thing I could leave you with after reading this book, it is that
    the best developers know how to seek out and find solutions for themselves from
    the many sources available to us. Sometimes those solutions are in books like
    this one; other times they are in documentation, blog posts, forums, podcasts,
    or even conversations with other people. The developer that can not only find
    these solutions, but also integrate and truly understand them is going to be incredibly
    valuable for the rest of their career. However, if you feel overwhelmed at the
    beginning, do not fret because we all started there. Focus your energy on one
    problem at a time and don't settle for a solution that just seems to work. Make
    sure that you understand every solution you put in place and you will quickly,
    without even realizing it, become an incredibly proficient developer.

  zh: 本章的篇幅虽短，但其重要性却十分显著。如果在阅读完这本书后我能给你留下什么，那就是最好的开发者知道如何从我们可利用的众多来源中寻求并找到自己的解决方案。有时这些解决方案就在像这样的书中；有时则存在于文档、博客文章、论坛、播客，甚至是与其他人的对话中。那些不仅能找到这些解决方案，还能将它们整合并真正理解的开发者，将在他们整个职业生涯中变得极其宝贵。然而，如果你在开始时感到不知所措，请不要担心，因为我们都从那里开始。一次专注于一个问题，不要满足于看似可行的解决方案。确保你理解你实施的每一个解决方案，你将很快，甚至可能没有意识到，成为一个极其熟练的开发者。
