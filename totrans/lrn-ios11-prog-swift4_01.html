            <p>So, you want to get into iOS development? I was in your shoes on January 27th, 2010,
               when Apple first announced the iPad. Literally as soon as the conference was over,
               I knew that I wanted to learn how to create apps for the iPad. I signed up to the
               Apple Developer website and paid my $99 annual fee. But then, I realized that I did
               not know where to begin. A large variety of instructional books or videos did not
               exist, especially since the iPad had not yet been released. I had previous programming
               experience; however, I had no idea how to write Objective-C (the original programming
               language for iOS). Therefore, I had to teach myself the basics. In this book, we will
               learn what it takes to become an iOS developer together.
            </p>
            
            <p>If you are new to programming, take your time. You should understand the lessons in
               one chapter before moving on to the next chapter. These important skills will set
               you up with a solid foundation in iOS development. If you have previous programming
               experience, you should still review the earlier chapters, as they will be a refresher
               for you.
            </p>
            
            <p>Throughout this book, we will work in Xcode, specifically Xcode 9 (and Swift 4, which
               we will tackle later in the book). Xcode is known as an <strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>). Using Xcode gives us everything we will need in order to build apps for iOS, tvOS,
               macOS (formerly, OS X), and watchOS. In this chapter, we will explore Xcode in order
               to help you get more comfortable using it. If you are not on Xcode 9, make sure to
               update Xcode, as the code in this book will not run properly otherwise.
            </p>
            
            <p>Our focus in this book will be on creating a universal iOS app (an app for both the
               iPhone and iPad). The best way to do this is to create a project to familiarize yourself
               with where everything is and how to find what you need. So, let's first download and
               install Xcode.

            <p>In order to download Xcode, launch the App Store on your Mac and then type <kbd>Xcode</kbd> into the search bar in the upper-right corner:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/986c84bc-1b15-4540-8a74-e6096a36e791.png"/></div>
            
            <div class="packt_infobox"><span class="fontstyle0">For better quality of images, download the graphics bundle from <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/LearniOS11ProgrammingwithSwift4SecondEdition_ColorImages.pdf">https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/LearniOS11ProgrammingwithSwift4SecondEdition_ColorImages.pdf</a></span><span class="fontstyle2">.</span></div>
            
            <p>Next, click on <span class="packt_screen">INSTALL</span>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/1603f530-1deb-40b8-a49a-ef24b1373e3c.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Once installed, launch Xcode and you should see the following <span class="packt_screen">Welcome to Xcode</span> screen:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/6feef58c-4f71-4482-99a8-d23608b04fbf.png"/></div>
            
            <p>If this is the first time you have launched Xcode, then you will see <span class="packt_screen">No Recent Projects</span> in the right panel. If you have previously created projects, then you will see those
               listed to the right. To get started, we are going to click on <span class="packt_screen">Create a new Xcode project</span> in the left panel of the welcome screen. This will take us to the new project screen:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/714dfe2f-4274-4f58-aaa4-bc6464ae304f.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Across the top of this screen, you can select one of the following items: <span class="packt_screen">iOS</span>, <span class="packt_screen">watchOS</span>, <span class="packt_screen">tvOS</span>, <span class="packt_screen">macOS</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Cross-platform</span>. Since we are creating apps for iOS, make sure that you have iOS selected. Then,
               select <span class="packt_screen">Single View App</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>. Now, you will see an options screen for a new project:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><span class="packt_screen"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/7e285a43-b7fe-46b3-8d26-02da450c96c4.png"/></span></div>
            
            <p>This option screen has the following seven items to complete or choose:</p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li><span class="packt_screen">Product </span><span class="packt_screen">Name</span>: The product name is your app. We are going to set ours as <kbd>ExploringXcode</kbd>.
               </li>
               
               <li><span class="packt_screen">Team</span>: The team is connected to your Apple account. We are going to ignore this for now,
                  because it is not needed for this chapter. If you have a team set up, just leave it
                  as is. We will cover this in greater detail later in the book.
               </li>
               
               <li><span class="packt_screen">Organization </span><span class="packt_screen">Name</span>: You can set the organization name to your company name or just your name.
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <ol start="4">
               
               <li><span class="packt_screen">Organizer I</span><span class="packt_screen">dentifier</span>: You will set the organizer identifier to be your domain name in reverse. For example,
                  my website URL is <kbd>cocoa.academy</kbd>, and therefore, my identifier is <kbd>academy.cocoa</kbd>. Since URLs are unique, it will ensure that no one else will have your identifier.
                  If you do not have a domain, then just use your first and last name for now. You will
                  eventually have to purchase a domain if you want to submit your app to the Apple Store.
               </li>
               
               <li><span class="packt_screen">Bundle I</span><span class="packt_screen">dentifier</span>: When you create a new project, Apple will combine your <span class="packt_screen">Product Name</span> with your <span class="packt_screen">Organizer Identifier</span> to create your unique bundle identifier. So, even if 10,000 people create this project,
                  each person will have a different bundle identifier.
               </li>
               
               <li><span class="packt_screen">Language</span>: Make sure your language is set to Swift.
               </li>
               
               <li><span class="packt_screen">Checkboxes</span>: You can uncheck <span class="packt_screen">Use Core Data</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Include Unit Tests</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Include UI Tests</span>, as these are things we will not be using in this chapter.
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <p>Now, select <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>, and Xcode will prompt us to save our project. I have a dedicated folder for all
               my projects, but you can save it on your desktop for easy access.
            </p>

            <p>Your project is now open and it is time for us to get familiar with all of the panels.
               If this is your first time in Xcode, then it will probably be a bit overwhelming for
               you. Therefore, we will break it down into five parts:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><strong>NAVIGATOR PANEL</strong></li>
               
               <li><strong>STANDARD EDITOR</strong></li>
               
               <li><strong>UTILITIES PANEL</strong></li>
               
               <li><strong><strong>DEBUG PANEL</strong></strong></li>
               
               <li><strong>TOOLBAR</strong></li>
               
               <li><strong>WINDOW PANE CONTROLS</strong></li>

            <p>The primary use for the navigator panel is to add new files and/or select existing
               files. The other icons are used from time to time; we will cover them as we need them.

            <p>The standard editor is a single panel view used to edit files. The standard editor
               area is the primary area in which you will work. In this area, we can view storyboard
               files, see our Swift files, or view our project settings.

         <article>
            
            
            <p>The utilities panel can be a bit confusing when you first use Xcode, because this
               menu changes based on what you have selected in the standard editor. When we start
               building an app, we will dig deeper into this. For now, just know that the utilities
               panel is made up of the inspector pane at the top and the library pane at the bottom.
               The inspector pane allows you to change the attributes or properties of things you
               put in your storyboard-the library pane allows you to insert objects, image assets,
               and code snippets into your app.

            <p>The debug panel will allow us to see log messages from our app. You will become very
               familiar with this panel by the time you finish this book. The debug panel is one
               of the greatest tools for getting feedback on what your app is doing or not doing.

            <h1 class="header-title">Toolbar</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Next, we look at the toolbar:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="331" src="assets/98e56d48-1f29-437f-aa05-900f4efc5bae.png" width="474"/></div>
            
            <p>First, we have a play button, which is how we launch our app (or use <span class="KeyPACKT"><em>cmd</em> + <em>R</em></span>). Next, you will see a stop button, which will not be active until you run your app.
               This stop button (or <em>c</em><span class="KeyPACKT"><em>md</em> + <em>.</em></span>) is used to stop your app from running. To the right of the stop button, you will
               see your target (your project name) along with the current Simulator selected. If
               you click on your project name, you will see a screen similar to this:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="420" src="assets/790f3711-840f-4d2e-ac9c-15f27342fb63.png" width="257"/></div>
            
            <p>This drop-down menu, which we will call the <span class="packt_screen">Device</span> and <span class="packt_screen">iOS Simulators</span> drop-down menu, allows you to change your Simulator type. For the purposes of our
               project, select <span class="packt_screen">iPhone</span><span class="packt_screen">7 Plus</span> as your Simulator and then click on the play icon (or use <em>cmd</em> + <em>R</em>) to run your app. Your app will be blank and will most likely not fit the entire
               screen (unless you are on a large screen).
            </p>
            
            <p>In order to see the entire screen, you can scroll right and left; however, doing this
               gets harder once you have elements in your app. So, an alternative to scrolling is
               to resize your app to fit the screen. We can do this by going to your <span class="packt_screen">Simulator</span> menu and navigating to <span class="packt_screen">Window</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Scale</span>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/1fb70b7a-839f-4fd9-8b6e-2f86ced4f103.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Here, you will be able to scale from <span class="packt_screen">200%</span> to <span class="packt_screen">100%</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">50%</span> (select whichever percentage allows the app to best fit your screen size).
            </p>
            
            <p>Now, let's return to Xcode and select the stop button (or use <em>cmd</em> + <em>.</em>).
            </p>
            
            <p>If you use the keyboard shortcut, make sure Xcode is in focus; otherwise, this shortcut
               will not work. I work on a 15-inch MacBook Pro Retina - therefore, when I am working
               on an app, I will use the iPhone 6 or iPad Air 2 simulator in landscape. They both
               fit nicely on my screen without having to resize either.
            </p>
            
            <p>In addition to the <span class="packt_screen">Simulator</span>, there is a <span class="packt_screen">Build Only Device</span> as well as a <span class="packt_screen">Device</span> section, both at the top of the <span class="packt_screen">Device</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Simulator</span> drop-down menu that was shown earlier in this chapter. Note that, for our purposes,
               you will only need a Simulator while we are building the app; however, you can add
               an iOS device if you would like (see under <span class="packt_screen">iOS Device</span>).
            </p>

            <p>The <span class="packt_screen">Generic iOS Device</span>, under the <span class="packt_screen">Build Only Device</span> section of the <span class="packt_screen">Device</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Simulator</span> drop-down menu, is used for when you need to archive your app, which means that you
               are preparing your app for submission to Apple (either to the App Store or to Test
               Flight). If you try to select <span class="packt_screen">Generic iOS Device</span> now and run the app, you will get the following message:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="159" src="assets/b7c5fdfc-6af0-4048-a9ba-3225c4dcf7e6.png" width="444"/></div>
            
            <p>Therefore, change <span class="packt_screen">Generic iOS Device</span> to an actual Simulator, and then you will be able to continue.

            <p>If you do not have a device connected to the computer, you will see <span class="packt_screen">No devices connected...</span> under the <span class="packt_screen">Device</span> section of the Device and Simulator drop-down menu.
            </p>
            
            <p>As noted earlier, when we start building the <em>Let's Eat</em> app, you will have the option of using the Simulator or connecting a device to Xcode.
               Using a device is slower; however, the simulator will not perform in the same way
               as a device will.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the past, you needed to have a paid account to build your app on a device. Now,
               you do not need a developer account in order to run the app on your device. Note that,
               if you decide to connect your device instead of using a Simulator, you will need iOS
               11 installed on it. Introduced in Xcode 9 is the ability to connect your phone wirelessly.
               We will look at the traditional way first and then we will go over how you connect
               your phone wirelessly.

            <p>Now that you have your phone and account connected it is easy to get your phone set
               up to run it wirelessly. With your device already connected via USB, go to <span class="packt_screen">Window</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Devices</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Simulators</span>. Click on the Checkbox marked <span class="packt_screen">Connect via network</span>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/cc11f35f-1174-4678-8c5f-4a5b72d3e994.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Make sure that your phone and your computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.</p>
            
            <p>When I first connected to my device, I saw a globe icon in Xcode that lets you know
               that you are connected via the network.
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="385" src="assets/8ac1ba16-9822-4508-9af2-0fc6b1c25d18.png" width="236"/></div>
            
            <p>After a short time, the globe went away. Even if you do not see the icon you can disconnect
               the USB and your device should still be connected to Xcode (as long as you are connected
               to the same Wi-Fi network).
            </p>
            
            <p>You will not need to use a device for the majority of this book; however, depending
               on the type of MacBook you have, you might need to use a device.
            </p>
            
            <p>Before we get to the right side of the Toolbar, select the <kbd>Main.storyboard</kbd> file in your navigator panel. This file is used to do all of your visual setup for
               your entire app. We will cover this in detail later in the book. After you select
               the file, you should see the following:

            <h1 class="header-title">Window pane controls</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>The following screenshot shows the window pane controls:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="65" src="assets/685d2209-69a4-4fbf-99b2-08959d65cd7e.png" width="399"/></div>
            
            <p>Moving onto the window pane controls, you will see two groups of icons. The first
               group is called the Editor Mode, and the second group is called the View. Let's look
               at the functions of the Editor Mode icons:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="117" src="assets/0ffbc663-142b-4699-b7e7-d3bb28fac30e.png" width="161"/></div>
            
            <p>This icon controls the standard editor (which is the center panel in the earlier screenshot
               of the <kbd>Main.storyboard</kbd> file in the navigator panel).
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="114" src="assets/54f2da6d-9d09-417a-8a49-0f19f5d66c47.png" width="130"/></div>
            
            <p>This icon splits the Standard editor into two panels, where you will see the <kbd>ViewController.swift</kbd> file on the right. We will use this split screen throughout the book.
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="97" src="assets/d0bebcfd-5be8-491d-b455-816a3469c8c5.png" width="129"/></div>
            
            <p>This icon is the Version editor. We will not address the Version editor in this book,
               since it is a more advanced feature.
            </p>
            
            <p>At this point, you might be thinking that there are way too many panels open, and
               I would agree with you. This is where the last group of View icons in the toolbar
               comes in handy.
            </p>
            
            <p>Let's look at these icons and their functions in the following table:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="122" src="assets/3cf0fcbb-6603-47af-adc6-ad4a049324b1.png" width="156"/></div>
            
            <p>This icon will toggle (hide or show) the navigator panel (or use <em>cmd</em> + <em>0</em>).
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="118" src="assets/f5873376-6a93-4b68-a017-10b01cd1a123.png" width="151"/></div>
            
            <p>This icon will toggle (hide or show) the debug panel (or use <em>cmd</em> + <em>shift</em> + <em>Y</em>).
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">&gt;<img class=" image-border" height="121" src="assets/c2d2b43b-00df-45bb-8394-d2bbb40db9aa.png" width="155"/></div>
            
            <p>This icon will toggle (hide or show) the utilities panel (or use <em>cmd</em> + <em>alt</em> + <em>0</em>).
            </p>

            <p>Congratulations! You have finished exploring the basics of Xcode. When we start building
               our app, we will cover the more important parts of Xcode in depth. It is now time
               to start learning Swift 4.
