<p>Kotlin Cookbook will be a go-to guide to problems new Kotlin developers get stuck with. Along with that, Kotlin Cookbook will also help developers learn handy tricks and concepts that they may need while coding. This book will also help developers uncover the full potential of an amazing programming language, that is, Kotlin.</p>
<p>The book starts with an overview of Kotlin and moves on to some great simple concepts and features that Kotlin offers. From there, it will move on to OOP fundamentals and creating simple Android applications. Next will be the recipes for more complicated concepts such as networking, database, architectures, file io, and testing. It will also cover some great features of Anko that really eases out some complicated concepts in Android development, making it faster and more fun. Last will be some miscellaneous but extremely useful recipes that developers might need from time to time.</p>
