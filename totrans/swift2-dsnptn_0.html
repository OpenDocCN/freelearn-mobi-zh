This is the reason why I have divided this book into three categories: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. For each category, you will find a chapter with a common structure: roles, a UML class diagram, participants, collaboration, illustration, and implementation with Swift.</p><p>This structure is an easy way to find the answers that you may ask yourself. In this book, I will first introduce you to the five creational patterns, followed by seven structural patterns, and then conclude with the eleven behavioral patterns, as defined by the GoF.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Creational Patterns">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Creational Patterns</em>, introduces you to the five patterns of a creational pattern category: the prototype, factory method, singleton, abstract factory, and builder patterns.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Structural Patterns – Decorator, Proxy, and Bridge">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Structural Patterns – Decorator, Proxy, and Bridge</em>, introduces you to structural patterns and helps you explore the decorator, proxy, and bridge patterns.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Structural Patterns – Composite and Flyweight">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Structural Patterns – Composite and Flyweight</em>, teaches you how to deal with the structure of multiple objects using the composite and flyweight patterns.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Structural Patterns – Adapter and Facade">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Structural Patterns – Adapter and Facade</em>, teaches you how to join the two types that were not designed to work with each other together, thanks to the adapter pattern. Then, you'll learn how the facade pattern can help you simplify the interface of a set of complex systems.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Behavioral Patterns – Strategy, State, and Template Method">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Behavioral Patterns – Strategy, State, and Template Method</em>, introduces you to the behavioral patterns. In this chapter, we will discuss the strategy, state, and template method patterns.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Behavioral Patterns – Chain of Responsibility and Command">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Behavioral Patterns – Chain of Responsibility and Command</em>, introduces you to two other behavioral patterns that are concerned with passing requests to an appropriate object that will then execute the action.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Behavioral Patterns – Iterator, Mediator, and Observer">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Behavioral Patterns – Iterator, Mediator, and Observer</em>, provides a way to implement communication between objects while keeping their independence and anonymity.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Behavioral Patterns – Visitor, Interpreter, and Memento">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Behavioral Patterns – Visitor, Interpreter, and Memento</em>, concludes with the discovery and implementation of the 23 patterns, as defined by the GoF.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>The only requirement for this book is to have Xcode 7 installed on your Mac computer. All the code provided has been written, compiled, and tested with Swift 2. You don't need any other software to follow the examples provided in this book. All samples in these book have been written using a OSX Command line tool project or a Playground file.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended for beginners as well as senior developers who want to take the next step in the software engineering industry.</p><p>This book will help you learn about the difference between a low-level programmer and a programmer with design pattern knowledge. You can apply this knowledge with Swift in Xcode to design scalable and flexible apps or games for iOS and Mac. As design patterns are not the exclusive reserve of Swift, but can be used by any other language, this is the knowledge that any developer and software architect must have.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text as are shown as follows: "<code class="literal">AbstractExpression</code>: It defines an <code class="literal">interpret()</code> method that is common to all node in the abstract syntax tree."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">class WalkMoveStrategy:IMoveStrategy{
  func performMove() {
    print("I am walking")
  }
}</pre></div><p> When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">class WalkMoveStrategy:IMoveStrategy{
  func performMove() {
<strong>    print("I am walking")</strong>
  }
}</pre></div><p>Any console output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
