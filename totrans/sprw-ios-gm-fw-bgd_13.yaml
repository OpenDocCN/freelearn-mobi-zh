- en: If you intend to publish a game on the Apple App Store, you should invest an
    extra amount of polish to get all the details right. This includes creating an
    icon and splash screens for all devices, getting the bundle identifiers, bundle
    version, and bundle names right. If your game allows switching its orientation
    from landscape to portrait or vice versa, you should make sure that it does so
    without any side effects. You should also double-check if all the graphics are
    being displayed correctly on all the target devices.
