Sprite Kit provides powerful features for graphics and the animation of images having texture, and so on. It is one of the best available game engines for iOS devices. It is very simple and powerful, with full support provided by Apple, hence it is more reliable and convenient than any third-party game engine available today.</p><p>The Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Xcode, provided by Apple for app development can also be used for Sprite Kit game development. Objective-C or Swift, either of the two programming languages can be used for Sprite Kit game development. Sprite Kit is already being used by many developers for iOS game development. There is a good amount of information available that focuses on Sprite Kit set up and development. However, a structured and concise resource discussing about the complete development process and feature set is not currently available. This book explains the basics of Sprite Kit development and allows a beginner to become skilled in Sprite Kit game development using the Swift programming language with its complete set of development features. This book is a complete guide for Sprite Kit and a perfect starting point for those wanting to set sail on the iOS game industry.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
