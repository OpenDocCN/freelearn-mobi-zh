- en: The lean start-up methodology has become a well-known term in the start-up land.
    There are many books covering this (and related methodologies) such as The Lean
    Startup (Eric ries), Running Lean (Ash Maurya), The start-up owner manual (Steve
    Blank), and The Four steps to the epiphany (Steve Blank).

- en: The lean start-up methodology is, among other things, about reducing waste by
    gathering feedback earlier. It makes no sense to develop a brilliant app for six
    months or longer only to find out later that nobody is interested in it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Your start-up, or even an existing app, needs multiple but short iterations
    to find out what works and what does not. That raises questions such as: Does
    your app actually solve a problem worth solving it? And how does the lean start-up
    methodology come into this?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All the books are currently focused on business-oriented members of your start-up
    or company. However, a pragmatic approach for the technical-oriented members of
    a company, with a mobile first strategy, is missing in particular. Theory is cool
    but a practical approach could help developers to move faster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book tries to fill that gap. It explains the elements of the Lean Start
    Up methodology and elaborates on research and on implementation. In particular,
    the focus is on things that need to be done from a technical point of view. That
    makes this book a down-to-earth guide on how to apply the lean start-up methodology
    to real Android and iOS development. As such, it comes without any mumbo-jumbo.
    If you want real action and if you want to develop an app that people need and
    really want to use, then this guide is for you.

    start-ups and existing business technical leaders seeking to integrate lead into
    their development operations. In addition, there are some Android and iOS code
    samples that we discuss to explain some of the concepts. Although the concept
    is more important than the code, you can try the sample for yourself. Where applicable,
    you can find a link to the Github repository, containing the code.

    the Android SDKs installed on your computer. **Android Studio** is available as
    a free download for Windows, OSX, and other operating systems. The Android examples
    are written in Kotlin and Java.
