- en: Welcome to *Part 4* of this book. In this part, you will implement the latest
    iOS 15 features. First, you will modify your app to work on both an iPhone and
    an iPad, and make it work on Macs. Next, you will learn how to develop SwiftUI
    apps, a great new way of developing apps for all Apple platforms. After that,
    you'll learn how to implement asynchronous and parallel programming using Swift
    Concurrency, and how to implement shared experiences using SharePlay. Finally,
    you'll see how to test your app with internal and external testers, and upload
    it into the App Store.
