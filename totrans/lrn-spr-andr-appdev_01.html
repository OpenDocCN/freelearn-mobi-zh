<p>The title of this book makes reference to two of the greatest stage names—Spring, ostensibly the best framework of Java, and Android, which has the greatest number of clients of any operating system. This book will help to you learn and develop a product-ready application on your own which will be lightweight, secure, powerful, and responsive. </p>
<p class="mce-root">Before start learning about the Spring and Android, we will demonstrate examples and code from Kotlin, as this programming language is very new to developers. These days, Kotlin is so popular that Google has declared it the official language of Android. Moreover, the Spring language also supports Kotlin. In this book, we will figure out how to make a robust, secure, and intense server dependent on Spring in the Kotlin language, and use the substance and utilize of this server in an Android application as a client.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to set up the environment to create Spring and Android projects, including the required tools and applications. This will include going through steps with accompanying images for visualization purposes. The developers who know Java, at that point, will have some leeway since it is the common platform among Spring and Kotlin. We will demonstrate the code and models with Kotlin that runs on JVM. The Kotlin is designed by JetBrains. On the off-chance that you are new to Kotlin and Spring, being familiar with Java will allow you to write code in Kotlin with ease. </p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Setting up the environment</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Spring</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"> Java</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"> Kotlin</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Apache Tomcat</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Integrated development environments</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Android</li>
</ul>

<p>To run these frameworks, we need some tools and a specific operating system. Here is the list of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating system:</strong><span> </span>Linux<span> </span>and<span> m</span>acOS are recommended for development because we can find all the required packages for these OSes and they are lighter than Windows.</li>
<li><strong>IDE:</strong><span> </span>My recommended IDE is IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate version). This is the best IDE for Java, but you have to purchase it to use it. You can also use Eclipse and Netbeans; only one of these is necessary to develop Spring applications. We will show all the projects in IntelliJ, but we will also learn the setup of the environments for Spring in both IntelliJ <span>IDEA</span><span> </span>and Eclipse.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>You can find all the examples from this chapter on GitHub: </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Spring-for-Android-Application-Development/">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Spring-for-Android-Application-Development/</a>.<a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Spring-for-Android-Application-Development/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/packt/learn_spring_for_android_application_development"/></p>

<p>An environment setup is one of the prime parts before developing an application. To the developers who are currently working with Spring, feel free to skip this part. This section is for new developers, who need to set up the foundation and the instruments to begin developing.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Here are the steps of how to set up the environment in the accompanying segments.</p>

<p><span>Spring is the most powerful Java application framework; it is currently the most popular in the enterprise world. It helps to create high-performing applications that have easily-testable and reusable code. This is open source and was written by Rod Johnson, first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">To create and run Spring applications, you need some tools and language supports. You also need a server to test and run your project in your operating system. We will show you how to set up the environment for Spring.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The following software and tools are needed with the current version:</p>

<li class="mce-root">Java (version 1.8)</li>

<p><span>To use Kotlin, you don't need to download or set it up separately like Java. It comes with the IDEs. Kotlin is a built-in feature of Android Studio, IntelliJ Ultimate, or IntelliJ Community. To use Kotlin in Eclipse, you need to follow these steps:</span></p>

<p>We require a steady, free, and open source web server that we can use to create and run Spring-Framework-based ventures. We will utilize Apache Tomcat, which is easy to understand for all developers of Java. You can also use Jetty or Undertow to develop in Spring.</p>
<p>Tomcat is an open source web server. This allows the utilization of Java Servlets and <strong>JavaServer Pages</strong> (<strong>JSP</strong>) for the Java server. The core segment of Tomcat is Catalina.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Apache Tomcat is a web server and not an application server.</div>
<p><span>You can download Tomcat 9.0.11 from </span><span><a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi">https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi</a>.<a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi"/></span></p>
<p><span>If you use Tomcat version 9, you have to use Java version 8 or later. According to the Apache Tomcat source, this version builds</span> on Tomcat 8.0.x and 8.5.x, and implements the Servlet 4.0, JSP 2.3, EL 3.0, WebSocket 1.1, and JASPIC 1.1 specifications (the versions required by the Java EE 8 p<span>latform).</span></p>
<p>Let's see how to configure and verify the Tomcat server.</p>

<p>You can configure the Tomcat server in two ways—either using the Terminal or from the IDE. To set up the server, you have to download the Tomcat server's content from <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi">https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi</a>. </p>
<p>Configuring Tomcat by these following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download a binary distribution of the core module from the link.</li>
<li>Extract the file. This creates a folder named <kbd>apache-tomcat-9.0.11</kbd> (version number can be changed).</li>

<p>When it comes to writing Java programs, you can use any text editor. However, we encourage you to use an <strong>integrated development environment</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>) because they provide numerous features. IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans are the best of them. IntelliJ is a paid IDE, but you can use Eclipse or NetBeans, which are free.</p>
<p><span><span>We can use IDE to do the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Manage Tomcat</li>
<li>Develop apps and web apps where there is no need to remember the full name of the methods and signatures</li>
<li>Highlight compile errors</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">In this book, we will work with Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.<br/>
You can download the Ultimate version, which has a 30-day free trial, from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/">https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/</a>.<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/"/></p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">To download the Eclipse, visit <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/</a>.<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/"/></p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">For Spring, you should download Eclipse IDE for the Java EE Developers version.</p>
<p class="mce-root">For both, once you start IDE, it will ask for a workspace. You can create a folder of your choice and give the path of that folder.</p>

<p>Eclipse is an incorporated development environment utilized in computer programming and is the most generally-utilized Java IDE. It contains a base workspace and an extensible module framework for tweaking the environment. Eclipse is composed generally in Java and its essential utility is for developing Java applications, yet it might likewise be utilized to develop applications in other programming dialects by means of modules, including Ada, ABAP, C, C++, C#, Clojure, COBOL, D, Erlang, Fortran, Groovy, Haskell, JavaScript, Julia, Lasso, Lua, NATURAL, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, R, Ruby (including the Ruby on Rails framework), Rust, Scala, and Scheme.</p>
<p>To use Kotlin in Eclipse, you will need to install the Kotlin plugin.<strong> </strong></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Eclipse doesn't have the latest version of Kotlin.</div>
