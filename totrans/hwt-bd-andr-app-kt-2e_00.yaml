- en: Android has ruled the app market for the past decade, and developers are increasingly
    looking to start building their own Android apps. *How to Build Android Apps with
    Kotlin* starts with the building blocks of Android development, teaching you how
    to use Android Studio, the **integrated development environment** (**IDE**) for
    Android, with the Kotlin programming language for app development.
  prefs: []

- en: Then, you’ll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices using
    guided exercises. You’ll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring
    an app to building out the UI with activities, fragments, and various navigation
    patterns. Progressing through the chapters, you’ll delve into Android’s RecyclerView
    to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching
    data from a web service and handling images.

- en: You’ll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model
    before working with notifications and how to persist data. Next, you’ll build
    user interfaces using Jetpack Compose. Moving on, you’ll get to grips with testing,
    covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You’ll also learn how **Android
    Architecture Components** (**AAC**) is used to cleanly structure your code and
    explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Coroutines and the Flow API are covered for asynchronous programming. The focus
    then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users
    interact with your apps. Toward the end, you’ll build an interesting app to retrieve
    and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish
    your apps on Google Play.
