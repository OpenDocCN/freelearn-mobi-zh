<p>It is not enough to just build a great app that your customers love. This is important, no doubt, but if you want to build a strategy that will succeed over time, you need to employ a range of tactics that will help you build and secure a market position and limit options for your competitors. In this chapter, we will look at the various techniques a savvy entrepreneur can use to build a moat around their business, thus minimizing the effects of an attack by a competitor.</p>
<p>In particular, we will look at the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intangible assets such as <strong>intellectual property</strong> (<strong>IP</strong>) laws and legal protections</li>
<li>The benefits of the network effect and the platform effect</li>
<li>Control over a vertical market or key relationships in a vertical market</li>
<li>Switching costs and pricing strategies</li>
<li>The benefits of good customer service and customer support</li>
<li>The power of a well-developed brand name</li>
</ul>

<p>Will your company be profitable in ten years? An enduring competitive advantage can keep your company profitable against the inevitable onslaught of competitors, imitators, and spinoffs. Establishing such a competitive advantage, or a "moat" around your business, is vital to ensuring long-term profitability and stability.</p>
<p>Competitors can come from all directions, so in order to protect your business, your product, and your ideas, you will need to employ a variety of tactics to defend your fortress against would-be attackers.</p>
<p>Developing an idea, testing it with early adopters, and refining it are the first important steps toward enduring success. A customer-centric, innovative solution to a problem is the cornerstone to a successful business. However, after you have tested and proven your hypothesis, you need to grow that seed of an idea in the real-world marketplace, which can be brutally competitive.</p>
<p>Early on, after your MVP has proven real-world viability, you will need to expand and perform a "land grab" with customers that need your solution. The more your business grows, the more competitors take notice; after all, marketplace visibility helps your business expand but it is also a magnet for competition. Once your business has taken its marketplace position and marked off its territory, you need to begin defending this territory.</p>
<p>A competitive advantage is your best means for long-term defense. Next, we will look at the most effective strategies when it comes to building that competitive advantage, so you can keep all of the profits that you work so hard to create.</p>

<p>Intangible assets typically refer to legal protections in the form of IP laws, patents, and trademarks. These are essential defense mechanisms for any product that has proven value in the marketplace. Good implementations will be stolen unless they are protected, so it is vital to look at your legal options as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Understanding how intellectual property laws work will help you to understand how best to protect your own work. A fringe benefit to understanding these laws is that you will also understand how to avoid stepping over an intellectual property line without knowing it:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A discussion about IP laws may seem far removed from the topic of lean development, especially for developers who are still in the early stages of MVP creation. However, the business world is brutal, especially when large sums of money are involved.</p>
<p>In the tech industry, patent demands and lawsuits are a commonplace, and it is no secret that they are frequently used as weapons against promising startups.</p>
<p>A 2013 paper by University of California Law Professor Robin Feldman presented data that proves why no startup should enter the marketplace without intellectual property armor. According to her survey of 200 venture capitalists:</p>
<ul>
<li>One out of three startups have received patent demands</li>
<li>70% of VC-backed startups have received patent demands</li>
<li>100% of venture capitalists said that "if a company had an existing patent demand against it, it could potentially be a major deterrent in deciding whether to invest"</li>
</ul>
<p>Her survey also found that the majority of patent demands came not from product owners or creators, but from entities whose main function is the licensing or litigation of patents. This fact strongly suggests that patent litigation is being backed by competitive groups behind the scenes. Clearly, IP lawsuits and patent demands are a standard weapon in the world of business warfare.</p>
<p>To protect yourself against such attacks, it pays to plan ahead.</p>
<p>Patenting and trademarking both take research, time, and money. It is easy to make excuses and put these necessities to the side, but the longer you do, the greater the risks. Next, we will offer a brief overview of IP laws, so you can make space in your long-term business plan for legal strategizing.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Intellectual property laws do not actually protect an idea, they only protect an implementation of that idea. Here are examples of how the major IP laws work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patents protect novel, "non-obvious," unique processes. They only cover the implementation of a physical object or physical designs that emanate from that idea, not the idea itself. Software programs or specific implementations of a technology, such as a novel app feature, can be protected but the general concept cannot.</li>
<li>Copyright laws protect against the expression of a creative idea, usually in a media form; Books, videos, music, and source code are examples of works that can be copyrighted. Copyrightable works are copyrighted as soon as they are created.</li>
<li>Trademarks protect the representation of a good or service, such as a company name, an OS startup tone, or a logo.</li>
<li>Trade secrets, such as source code or the formula for Coca-Cola, remain protected indefinitely. These secrets cannot be knowingly infringed upon, but they can be stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though these intellectual property laws are the most well-known and common defenses against infringement and theft, they are not the only ways to secure your position.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How to defend your intellectual property</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The most essential step for protecting your app is the securing of patents. UI elements, unique and novel app features, and software programs themselves can all be patented. Trademarks can be used to protect specific design elements, the design layout as a whole, as well as the name and expression of your app and your company.</p>
<p>In the event of a patent demand, every company must decide for itself how to proceed. After all, every legal battle would come with its own risks, benefits, and drawbacks. The preceding study by Dr. Feldman found that for the majority of her survey's participants, patent demands cost over $50,000 to prepare and defend against. Every situation is unique, and each company should make its own decision in the event they are served a patent demand.</p>
<p>The flipside of not having a patent at all, of course, is that another company would be free to copy, steal, and patent your technology for themselves. The very first step, therefore, is to ensure that you are protecting your intellectual property every step of the way.</p>
<p>Next, we will examine another side of the legal arena: how to use the law as a weapon instead of a defense.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Though this may be an unpleasant discussion for some, it is important to reiterate that the business world is a different ballgame from app experimentation and development. Although a lean approach will help you develop relevant products that customers need and want, you must arm yourself for fierce competition as you make your way into the marketplace. Legal tactics, however, are one method to isolating, securing, and monopolizing certain sectors of your market.</p>
<p>Peter Thiel, billionaire founder of PayPal, argues that "<em>when you start a company you always want to aim for monopoly and you want to always avoid competition.</em>" The more money you waste engaging and out-competing your rivals, the less money you can spend on innovation and growth.</p>
<p>While we are not advocating stealing intellectual property, patent trolling, or bullying smaller companies out of existence, you can certainly develop legal mechanisms that bar competitors from your territory and free up company resources for other things.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of how companies have used legal blockades to widen their economic moats:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mortgage broker training company, for whom I created software years ago, promoted state laws that required broker certification in each state, the very service his company offered. This was a smart strategy that yielded very positive results.</li>
<li>As mentioned previously, in the "shark tank" world of business, it is technically legal to appropriate certain design elements or features that remain unprotected by patents or trademarks.</li>
<li>Amazon, a monopoly that has decisively shaken up the retail industry in the United States and beyond, has a history of using legal offensive maneuvers. Like many tech companies, it has used patents to maintain its competitive advantage and it has used legal loopholes to avoid collecting sales taxes in many states (and thus increase its price advantage over other businesses).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the legal front, every move you can make will help you keep your competitors away from your castle. The law is very effective for both offense and defense, but it is only one tool among many. Next, we will look at more user-focused business strategies that will further entrench your market position, stifle competition, and maximize control over your market.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The network effect occurs when the value of a product or service increases as the number of users increase:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="253" src="assets/31f0a70a-7f44-4138-95fc-2b4d222624f0.png" width="381"/></div>
<p>The first type of network effect occurs when the users themselves add value to the product or service. The user-generated content that powers Facebook, forums, and search engines, for instance, adds value to these services, effectively transforming users into assets.</p>
<p>The Platform Effect, which is considered by some to be another type of network effect, refers to the amplification of value that occurs when a company is able to offer a platform - an array of services - rather than just a single product. As more business partners add services to the platform, the value increases.</p>
<p>Both of these effects are eminently visible in today's technology industry.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>To illustrate the first type of network effect, we will look at the world's largest social app and the world's largest online retail company, Facebook and Amazon. Both starkly illustrate how users contribute to, and amplify, the value of a product or service.</p>
<p>Examine how the network effect plays out with both of these companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The more people that use Facebook, for instance, the more momentum and value it accrues, since it can be used to connect with more and more people. A byproduct of this effect is that the value of competing social networks is diminished, making it more difficult to switch to a competitor. This effect, known as a switching cost, is examined in more detail further.</li>
<li>In Amazon's case, the more sellers it acquires on its marketplace, the bigger its inventory, the more competitive its pricing, the more it becomes known as the go-to online retail store, and the more entrenched its market position becomes.</li>
<li>For both companies, word-of-mouth marketing becomes more powerful as the network effect grows, consequently decreasing the cost of user acquisition.</li>
<li>The more people that use either service, the more that either service's brand image and reputation is boosted.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only two businesses in a sea of companies that benefit from the Network Effect. Whether designing mobile apps or social networks, it pays to think about how you can turn your users into assets so that they can enhance the value of your end product.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>As mentioned, the platform effect, another type of network effect, also occurs as more business partners augment the original service with their own complementary products or services. WordPress and Windows offer excellent examples of how you can leverage this effect to expand the moats around your app's castle.</p>
<p>Both of these companies, while offering very different core products, illustrate this effect into action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows, due to its decades-old market dominance, has nearly locked down its position as the de facto operating system for PCs. In doing so, it has aligned itself with an army of PC manufacturers, software developers, and associated industries that vastly enhance Windows' original services by supplying their own complementary products and services.</li>
<li>WordPress, similarly, functions as a platform of its own. This open-source content management system, officially the world's most popular, has been built for expandability. It easily allows developers to create plugins, themes, and modifications. Due in part to this platform effect, WordPress functionality has grown by leaps and bounds, further amplifying its growth and making it nearly impossible for other content management systems to infringe upon their territory.</li>
<li>In the automotive industry, where I work, software companies that provide a platform that seamlessly unifies a range of products put standalone startups in a tough position to succeed.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are countless other examples of the platform effect in action. From operating systems, to web browsers, to financial software, the list of software that benefit from the platform effect goes on and on. Some products, such as Windows or Android, are primarily platform products. Others, such as WordPress or QuickBooks, offer a core service that is made much more robust by complementary products. If your product can benefit from a network of users, or if it can be leveraged as a platform, you should make that a core part of your product design and market development plan.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In business, a vertical market, or a "vertical", is a specialized niche market that serves a narrow industry or customer base. A software company that develops mobile point-of-sale software specifically for restaurants would be operating within a vertical market. An app that serves as a social network for amateur photographers in New York would be another example.</p>
<p>Horizontal markets, unlike vertical markets, are generalized markets that sell their products to a wide range of customers. Technically speaking, all businesses operate both horizontally and vertically, though to varying degrees. The chief advantage of a horizontal market is that it offers a much larger user base than a vertical market. On the other hand, horizontal marketplaces are much more competitive and are extraordinarily difficult to penetrate.</p>
<p>As we will see, making use of vertical markets can give you a major competitive edge, aid horizontal expansion, and provide you with a secure economic foothold.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Access to and control of a vertical can mean the difference between rapid growth and a snail's pace. Though verticals have their weaknesses, such as a limited customer base and financial conditions that fluctuate with the health of that particular industry, they offer significant advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vertical markets give you a channel where you can sell your product and build relationships with customers in a focused way</li>
<li>Though some vertical markets are saturated with competition, others are not, which will make it easier for you to take a dominant market position</li>
<li>Controlling a vertical, in essence, allows you to create a monopoly within that market, which guarantees income, customers, and economic relationships</li>
<li>Due to the specificity of the user base and the industry, many aspects of business become much easier and more cost-effective, from marketing to user testing to user acquisition</li>
</ul>
<p>Though you should gain access to and control a vertical, this is not to say that you should operate exclusively within that vertical. As we saw in <a href="774e65d5-5ac0-4ade-9f9e-cffb2a911441.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 11</span></a>, <em>Onboarding and Registration</em>, monopolizing a narrow market is an ideal first step towards horizontal expansion.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Although complete control over a vertical is no easy feat, the exclusion of competition from your territory allows you to, in some respects, dictate the terms for your marketplace. The following are examples of how companies have expanded and exploited via such vertical control:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple's control of its value chain demonstrates a nearly complete example of vertical control, or vertical integration. It designs and develops its own desktop and mobile hardware, the operating system that runs on that hardware, as well as a wide range of apps and software products that operate within this environment.</li>
<li>One Stanford study found that vertical integration in the healthcare field, in the form of contractual obligations between hospitals and physician practices, often resulted in higher healthcare costs and hospital spending - in other words, increased profits for healthcare professionals.</li>
<li>In the automotive industry, suppliers that grew quickly usually did so through OEM relationships. OEM endorsements or promotions translated into rapid market growth and a more secure market position.</li>
<li>My previous company grew rapidly when it secured a relationship with an ad group that gave it access to many auto dealers. The boost was immediate, resulting in a rapid surge in business.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ultimate form of vertical control comes in the form of vertical integration, where a company is able to control its own supply chain. For the vast majority of companies this is impossible, but the more access you have to a vertical market, the easier it is to reap economic benefits.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Switching costs refer to the costs that arise for a customer when they switch to a competitor's product or service. Steep switching costs can prevent users from leaving. Depending on the situation, these costs can come in a variety of forms. Here are examples of the types of switching costs that would impact a company considering new enterprise-grade software packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct costs</strong>: Costs associated with researching, evaluating, and negotiating the prices of these new software packages</li>
<li><strong>Relationship costs</strong>: Disruption or dissatisfaction among team members who are used to the old product</li>
<li><strong>Product-related costs</strong>: Purchase price and training costs, as well as financial costs associated with decoupling oneself from the original product</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples of the costs associated with a B2B product switch, but they tend to be the most common that you find.</p>
<p>Maintaining high switching costs for acquired customers, and lowering inbound switching costs for new customers, is an integral part of any product strategy. Although switching costs can be so high that customers are effectively trapped onboard, we will see next how this strategy can backfire.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In order to raise switching costs for your own product, look at the preceding list. Consider the ways in which you can deliberately increase these costs for existing customers to deter abandonment, while lowering competitors' switching costs to incentivize adoption of your product. Here are real-world examples of switching costs that you can use to brainstorm ideas for your own product or service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large-enterprise software packages, such as InfusionSoft, QuickBooks, or Salesforce, involve high switching costs across the board. They require significant research and evaluation; they have steep learning curves and training costs, and can cause significant disruption to employees who are used to doing things a different way.</li>
<li>Cellular phone contracts are excellent examples of how companies decrease competitors' switching costs while increasing their own. Once locked into a contract, contract cancellation fees make it financially difficult for customers to leave. To incentivize signups, however, many contracts offer significantly discounted mobile phones to new customers.</li>
<li>Social apps and most other modern apps have reduced the barrier to entry significantly - they are easy to use, free, and allow immediate social interaction. The network effect, however, makes relationship switching costs so high that it can be nearly impossible to make the change. The loss of connection with friends or family, for instance, makes it difficult for many users to leave Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples of how switching costs are used by large businesses to keep users on board. For more ideas, examine any successful technology company in your market or a similar market and think about ways that the company keeps switching costs high for its existing user base, and then apply that same thinking to how you position your product in the market.</p>
<p>As mentioned, decreasing the cost of customers from switching from a competitor is one way to lower the barrier to entry for your product or service. Next, we will look at how you can use this strategy to accelerate the growth of your user base and erode your competitors' territory.</p>

<p>To make it easier for people to defect from your competitors, find ways to neutralize or reduce competitors' switching costs. Building upon the previous examples, we will look at a few ways that the aforementioned companies reduce switching costs for competitors' customers:</p>
<ul>
<li>QuickBooks employs many standard techniques to make signups easier and cheaper. To ease the stress and perceived costs associated with using a new product, QuickBooks naturally offers a free trial. To reduce the learning curve, it offers user-friendly videos as well as in-app tutorials and guides. Also, it makes judicious use of the platform effect; the plethora of plugins and third-party integrations make it easier for users to get up and running with services that customers may already subscribe to.</li>
<li>Though the previously mentioned cellular contract cancellation fees kept many customers from switching to other providers, the 2-year contracts, the early termination fees, and the up-front investments made customers feel trapped. Underdog carriers took advantage of this sentiment by removing onboarding and offboarding barriers alike; customers could use their own phones instead of purchasing new ones, they were not required to sign contracts, and they could leave whenever they liked.</li>
<li>Most social apps decrease competitors' switching costs using many of the same tactics that you can employ in your own app via the Lean methodology. Namely, successful social apps are very relevant, usable, well-designed, and high-performing. All of these factors contribute to a successful first experience of an app, which, as many developers know, can mean the difference between a new user and an uninstall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Switching costs, as well as any other business strategies covered in this section: should be built around a product that users need and want. If the business becomes imbalanced and pours its energy into the business battleground at the expense of the product and customer, then the product itself risks becoming weak thus losing market share. This brings us to another lean-oriented strategy that will help you stay focused on your customers as well as the business arena.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Good customer support</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Good customer support is often forgotten by many new businesses. This is foolish, since when your customers believe that you care about their success, then they are less likely to leave you.</p>
<p>Successful companies have long believed that customer service and customer satisfaction have a direct impact on customer loyalty and profits. A number of statistics back up the idea that customer service is vital to every business, both large and small:</p>
<ul>
<li>News of bad customer service reaches twice as many people as news of good customer service</li>
<li>It is at least six times more expensive to gain a new customer than to keep an existing one</li>
<li>70% of buying experiences are based on how the customer feels they are being treated</li>
<li>Gallup found that customers care more about the quality and thoroughness of customer service than the speed of that service</li>
</ul>
<p>Startups have a lot on their plates, so it is understandable that customer service would take a backseat to other issues. However, providing good customer service is not a cliché and should not become a hollow mantra. When you consider the direct impact that customer service has on your bottom line, it is worth considering ways that you can improve customer service from the very start.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The right perspective on customer service</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>It is widely acknowledged that customers' treatment affects their perception of a product, a company, and a brand, which impacts loyalty. This recognition has given rise to the idea of the "customer experience," which can be designed and improved upon. What makes a perfect customer experience, however, is up for some debate.</p>
<p>The shift in focus toward customer satisfaction, for many businesses, has resulted in efforts to treat customers like royalty or to delight them. This pandering approach is problematic for several reasons-it is based on the statistically-backed notion that customer satisfaction matters, but the solution, "delighting" customers, has no scientific grounding.</p>
<p>Instead of pandering to them, stick with the lean methodology and listen to them.</p>
<p>Customers, whether they are app users or retail shoppers, want their problem solved. According to research published in the Harvard Business Review, over-the-top "delightful" customer service "doesn't build loyalty," while "reducing their effort-the work they must do to get their problem solved-does." Act on this knowledge, they say, and you will improve customer service, cut customer service costs, and reduce customer attrition.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In the early stages of your company, you may not be rolling in funds. Fortunately, technology allows many young startups to achieve 80% of the results for only 20% of the effort. Here are a few ways that you can maximize your customer service efforts without wasting money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate your availability and attentiveness by responding publicly on social media and on reviews. If one person makes a comment, rest assured that others feel the same way. After all, research has shown that for one person who speaks out, there are many more who stay silent.</li>
<li>Create an online knowledge base so customers can find answers quickly and easily, without needing to contact you directly. This will save time for both you and your users.</li>
<li>Solve problems before customers notice that anything is wrong. Understand analytics and listen to customers so that you can discover budding pain points, solve them, and fix them as needed.</li>
<li>Stay customer-focused throughout the cycle. Rather than pandering, be attentive, solve problems, and listen to them throughout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always remember that app users are customers, not variables or children who should be "delighted." Good customer service will have a ripple effect on the rest of your business. Even though you may not be able to measure every aspect of that effect, it can mitigate negative experiences and significantly improve the overall user experience of your brand.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Top-level customer service has helped many companies receive the benefits mentioned above, including increased customer loyalty, decreased attrition, and increased lifetime values. Here are a few examples of companies that have expanded their economic moats via the customer service route:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon's central principle is the customer experience, and it has built its entire business around listening to customers. According to founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, "If you make a customer unhappy in the physical world, they might tell six friends, but online, they can each tell 6,000." Every aspect of Amazon's business model, from their return policy to their customer support staff to their product recommendation engine, is geared towards one goal: making customers happy.</li>
<li>Apple's customer service training manual, which was leaked in 2012, puts the customer experience first. Instead of a sales-first approach, the <em>Genius Training Student Workbook</em> is, according to Gizmodo, "an exhaustive manual for understanding customers and making them happy," because "a happy customer is a customer who will buy things." The thoroughness of this approach makes it clear that no aspect of the customer experience should be left to chance.</li>
<li>My old company sold a CMS software solution to auto dealers that had a range of add-ons to improve dealer customer outreach, acquisition, and management. We had two goals:
<ul>
<li>Create easy to use affordable apps</li>
<li>Always seek to make the customers happy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of this was a company that grew well within its market (without extensive financing) and an extremely low attrition rate. We never waited for a customer to call; we always reached out offering ways that they could maximize the use of our products so that they could make more money. We weren't Apple or Amazon, but we practiced the same principles.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Customer satisfaction is an emotion, so it is more difficult to measure than harder metrics such as conversion rates. It is also more difficult to measure the business impact of the customer experience, customer loyalty, and other customer relationship metrics. However, based on available research, as well as the behavior and customer service track records of some of the world's most successful companies, it is clear that stellar customer service can help you stick out in the minds of your customers. The last strategy we will cover in this chapter, developing a strong brand, will help you stick out in the minds of your customers as well as in the marketplace as a whole. But first we will take a quick look at some tools that will help you with customer support.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are dozens of customer service tools in the market at the time of this writing. Many of them include free trials and free features. Here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zendesk (</strong><a href="https://zendesk.com"><span class="URLPACKT">https://zendesk.com</span></a><strong>)</strong>: This is a robust customer support platform that offers certain free features</li>
<li><strong>Freshdesk (</strong><a href="https://freshdesk.com"><span class="URLPACKT">https://freshdesk.com</span></a><strong>)</strong>: This also offers a free version that may suffice for startups and small firms</li>
<li><strong>Salesforce desk (</strong><a href="https://desk.com"><span class="URLPACKT">https://desk.com</span></a><strong>)</strong>: This is a part of the Salesforce suite, making it a good choice for companies that use Salesforce</li>
<li><strong>Zoho desk (</strong><a href="https://www.zoho.com/desk/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.zoho.com/desk/</span></a><strong>)</strong>: A member of the Zoho suite of products would be a good choice for businesses that use Zoho</li>
<li><strong>Conversocial (</strong><a href="https://www.conversocial.com/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.conversocial.com/</span></a><strong>)</strong>: This focuses on social and mobile app support</li>
</ul>
<p>A vast majority of these tools offer free trials and even free plans that naturally have limited functionality. Most of these tools integrate a knowledge base with ticket-based support, real-time chat, and call center software.</p>
<p>When evaluating the various options, look for features that would be pertinent to your organization. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you intend to integrate live chat support within your app?</li>
<li>Would it be beneficial to integrate customer support with third-party tools, such as Zapier?</li>
<li>Are you already using an existing suite, such as Salesforce, Freshworks, or Zoho?</li>
<li>What type of widgets and embeddables are offered by each platform?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions will help you sift through the mountain of customer support options on the market, narrowing down your testing time.</p>
<p>Finally, do not forget to explore chat tools if you want to stay close to and get immediate feedback from your customers. Today, it is very easy to install widgets in your app that integrate with customer support software. Live chat support could become burdensome, depending on the size of your operation, though that can certainly decrease the gap between you and your customers. Such real-time interaction can improve customer satisfaction and enhance your understanding of their needs. Again, like the dedicated customer support tools listed previously, you have many options. Here are just a few award winning options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ZenDesk Chat (</strong><a href="https://www.zopim.com/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.zopim.com/</span></a><strong>)</strong>: Formerly known as Zopim, the app was recently acquired by ZenDesk into their suite of products. They offer a 14 day free trial</li>
<li><strong>LiveHelpNow (</strong><a href="http://www.livehelpnow.net/"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.livehelpnow.net</span>/</a><strong>)</strong>: This option offers a free 30 day trial with video, customization, mobile version, and analytics</li>
<li><strong>WebsiteAlive (</strong><a href="https://www.websitealive.com/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.websitealive.com/</span></a><strong>)</strong>: This option offers a free version for one user and has backup operators to answer for you in off hours</li>
</ul>

<p>According to Nielsen, for customers in North and South America, brand recognition was the second-most important reason customers purchased a product. Additional research by Nielsen shows that brand recognition influences purchase decisions in both developed and developing markets, with the majority of people preferring to buy new products from brands with which they are familiar.</p>
<p>A brand name keeps you "top of mind" for your customers and prospects, making it harder for new competitors to get noticed. The right brand name can create positive feelings about your product and a level of loyalty that makes it hard for startups, upstarts, or existing companies to compete.</p>
<p>Building that brand name may take time and effort, but it is possible with a concerted effort and a strategic marketing plan.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Since customers statistically make more purchases from recognized names than unrecognized names, it is clear that a brand is important. While this intangible asset may seem vague and even more difficult to measure than customer service, it is vital to any business that wants to stand out from its competition. Here are a few of the most important aims that a brand name can achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognition</strong>: When customers recognize your brand, they immediately connect that brand to everything associated with your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Promise</strong>: Your brand name conveys your promise to your customers. It evokes your value proposition or your unique selling proposition and tells customers what they can expect when they purchase your products or services.</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong>: The more powerful a brand name, the more trusted that name becomes. Trust is one reason that customers buy from brands they recognize: past experiences and reputation work together to evoke that trust in customers.</li>
<li><strong>Status</strong>: Brand also conveys status, as is particularly evident in the clothing industry. When a customer is associated with a well-known brand, they are also associated with that brand's status and image.</li>
<li><strong>Loyalty</strong>: Over time, brand inspires loyalty in customers that helps to accomplish the same aims as other strategies mentioned in this chapter: you establish secure market territory with a loyal tribe of users, successfully keeping competitors out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brand equity, or the financial value of your brand, may be even more difficult to measure than the ROI on customer service improvements. However, its power remains unquestioned and it is an essential tool in your arsenal if you wish to build an economic moat around your castle.</p>

<p>Branding is a deep topic and beyond the scope of this book. If your budget permits, consider hiring specialists to help you develop your brand more fully. However, when you cover these essentials, you can begin to build the foundation of a good brand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A good name</strong>: The best names are carefully designed to evoke certain emotional associations. The automaker Jaguar, for instance, intentionally evokes the animal of the same name. Choose a name that projects the emotions and identity of what you want to convey to your customers.</li>
<li><strong>Visual identity</strong>: Your logo, your color scheme, and visual designs across your presence should remain consistent with your brand identity and with each other. Keep the same scheme across, for instance, your website, your apps, and your marketing materials.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong>: Behind every brand lies a story. That story integrates with the other elements of your brand and manifests in your business communications, from marketing to customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Begin by extrapolating from the business canvas model that you created in <span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 2</span>, <em>Lean Startup Primer</em>, using information about your company's mission and your target audience. Find out what impressions you want to convey to your audience and the world, then work with creatives to develop the building blocks previously mentioned.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Brand monitoring and social media monitoring tools have been on the rise for a while now, and they come in every shape and size. Some are free, while enterprise-grade tools can cost as much as an employee. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hootsuite (</strong><a href="https://hootsuite.com"><span class="URLPACKT">https://hootsuite.com</span></a><strong>)</strong>: This is a popular social media management platform that also monitors brand conversations</li>
<li><strong>Mention (</strong><a href="https://mention.com"><span class="URLPACKT">https://mention.com</span></a><strong>)</strong>: This will track keywords or sets of keywords on social media and the web to help you track when and where your brand is mentioned</li>
<li><strong>Buzzsumo (</strong><a href="https://buzzsumo.com"><span class="URLPACKT">https://buzzsumo.com</span></a><strong>)</strong>: This allows you to create alerts for keywords, authors, domains, and backlinks</li>
<li><strong>SocialOomph (</strong><a href="https://socialoomph.com"><span class="URLPACKT">https://socialoomph.com</span></a><strong>)</strong>: This is another social media management tool that includes monitoring functions</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the more common options at the time of this writing, though more can be expected in the coming years. Startups on a budget can consider integrating free services, such as the preceding tools, with automation services such as Zapier and IFTTT.</p>

<p>Startups on a budget can easily take advantage of today's rapidly globalizing freelance marketplace to help with any service imaginable, from market research, to virtual office support, to graphic design, to copywriting.</p>
<p>Google can give you more options, but here are a few to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiverr</strong>: Fiverr (<a href="https://fiverr.com"><span class="URLPACKT">https://fiverr.com</span></a>) is a freelance marketplace that offers services in $5 units, and most services are well under $100 each</li>
<li><strong>Upwork</strong>: Upwork (<a href="https://upwork.com"><span class="URLPACKT">https://upwork.com</span></a>) allows you to post projects and budgets, then receive bids from freelancers</li>
<li><strong>Freelancer</strong>: Freelancer (<a href="https://freelancer.com"><span class="URLPACKT">https://freelancer.com</span></a>) operates like Upwork and you can create project specs and budgets, post that project, then work with freelancers closely throughout the project</li>
<li><strong>Craigslist</strong>: Finally, Craigslist (<a href="https://craigslist.org"><span class="URLPACKT">https://craigslist.org</span></a>), the world's most popular classified advertising site, allows you to advertise directly and recruit your own independent contractors</li>
</ul>
<p>Low-cost options such as these will require investment on your part, but they can be very helpful for bootstrapped startups.</p>
<p>The best way to review a freelancer is to first do some research on the task you need done so that you can identify best practices for the activity. Then, when you do the interview, you can ask them questions about the best practices to see how they respond. If they have no clue, then steer clear.</p>
<p>The next thing is to do a pilot and then review carefully for quality, timeliness, attention to detail, and so on. If you like what you see then try something bigger. If not...run.</p>
<p>I have employed a lot of freelancers. Those simple rules have saved me serious money. Of course, I had to lose some money first to learn my lesson.</p>
<p>Approach branding in the same way that you approach your MVP: build, measure, learn. You can always evolve and pivot as necessary, once you have the resources to do so.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>The right brand image can distinguish you from your competitors, inspire trust, and keep you at the top of your customers' minds. Some brands are done well and others are not. Fashion brands, for instance, tend to be very brand-centric, while technology companies fall all over the map. Here are a few instructive examples of how technology brands play out in the real world:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Apple has a thoroughly developed brand identity that stretches from its logo and name to its product designs to the staff training manual mentioned previously. Its branding strategy is praised universally as being extraordinarily well done. Some experts even believe that Apple's marketing and branding have been the key to its success, not its products. Regardless, Apple's brand recognition is undeniable and resonates across every aspect of the customer experience, so it pays to examine how the aforementioned branding essentials are present across the Apple empire.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: Although massively successful companies make excellent objects of study, they do not always do everything right. Microsoft's brand lacks and is reminiscent of earlier decades, when brand names were more functional than fashionable. Think of General Motors, International Business Machines (IBM), or American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T). Design expert Don Norman says of Microsoft, "If you make a product that everybody loves you end up with a bland product that everybody will accept but nobody truly loves." The same can be said of branding.</li>
<li><strong>Starbucks</strong>: Starbucks' meteoric rise to become one of the world's biggest coffee cafe chains has been attributed to its mission, offering "the richest possible sensory experience." Their brand is visible throughout their stores, from the layout to the logo, and has become indelibly etched in the minds of coffee drinkers around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology companies may not do branding as well as clothing companies or brand-oriented luxury companies, but we can still learn from their examples. Apple, in particular, demonstrates many successful branding techniques that are found in other modern, fashionable brands, as opposed to "old-fashioned" appearing brands such as Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, or IBM.</p>
<p>Finally, let's remember that you must start with vision for your brand, your product, and your user. Ask yourself a few important questions about your brand:</p>
<ul>
<li>How important is quality?</li>
<li>How important is the user experience?</li>
<li>How do you want people to feel about your product?</li>
<li>What type of relationship do you want to have with your customers?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have a vision and a direction for your brand, you can position yourself in the marketplace and begin to promote that brand. Marketing is a vast field and beyond the scope of this book, so it is advisable to connect with marketers within your network, read basic marketing books, or take a course on digital marketing.</p>

<p>In order for your app to stay competitive, especially when you expand into larger marketplaces, it is clear that it can't just be a "great app." Your business requires a thorough, well-planned strategy in order to expand and protect its position in the market.</p>
<p>If you want to create an app that lasts, you must consider how each of the tactics listed previously can be used to build an unfair advantage. Identify the tactics that you can apply and exploit them in full, as early as possible in the lifecycle of your product. Here is a brief summary of the tactics and strategies covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intangible assets</strong>: Legal protection can be used defensively or offensively. In the cutthroat world of business, you must be prepared for any eventuality, especially if your MVP proves successful and your product begins to build momentum.</li>
<li><strong>The network and platform effects</strong>: Connected users and business partners are not just customers, they are assets that add value to your software as it grows. Use this to your advantage and leverage that value to aid expansion and protect your territory.</li>
<li><strong>Make use of vertical markets</strong>: Access to, or, better yet, control over, a vertical market allows you to establish a competition-free zone to transact business. Establish and maintain relationships in a vertical so that you can have free reign in a specific industry or marketplace.</li>
<li><strong>Switching cost strategies</strong>: Switching costs can inhibit new users from leaving a company, so do your best to lower competitors' switching costs while raising your own. Doing so will improve user retention and make it easier for customers to enter your territory.</li>
<li><strong>Good customer support</strong>: Customers take front and center in the lean methodology, so they should also take front and center in your business strategy. Good customer support will lower attrition, boost your reputation, and decrease acquisition costs.</li>
<li><strong>The power of branding</strong>: A strong brand equates to a strong image. It stands for something that customers can relate to and identify with, and it helps companies differentiate themselves from their competitors. Developing an effective branding strategy will keep you at the top of your customers minds, establish trust, and foster feelings of loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these strategies stray outside the scope of the lean methodology, the rationale for including them should be clear: in order to be successful, a business must be pragmatic. Businesses must adopt practical business strategies that will help their products survive real-world market conditions. Competition is inevitable, which is why you must do all you can to build an unfair advantage and stack the deck in your favor.</p>
