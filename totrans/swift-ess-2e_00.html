To experiment with Swift, you will need either a Mac OS X or Linux computer that meets the requirements shown at <a class="calibre1" href="https://swift.org/download/">https://swift.org/download/</a>.</p><p class="calibre8">To run the exercises involving Xcode in Chapters 2–8, you need to have a Mac OS X computer running 10.9 or above with Xcode 7.2 or above. If newer versions of Swift are released, check the book's GitHub repository or the book's errata page at Packtpub for details about any changes that may affect the book's content.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note01" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre8">The Swift playground (described in <a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 2. Playing with Swift" href="part0023_split_000.html#LTSU2-d7e55eb5242648e89c396442afe4f84b">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Playing with Swift</em></span>) is only available as part of Xcode on OS X and is not part of the open source version of Swift.</p><p class="calibre8">Also, iOS and watchOS development (<span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Chapters 3-8</em></span>) is only possible on OS X with Xcode; it is not possible to create iOS or watchOS applications on other platforms. Most of the required libraries and modules for iOS development are not available as part of the open source version of Swift.</p></div><p class="calibre8">Xcode can be installed via the App Store as a free download; search for <code class="literal">Xcode</code> in the search box. Alternatively, Xcode can be downloaded from <a class="calibre1" href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/</a>, which is referenced from the iOS Developer Center at <a class="calibre1" href="https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/">https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/</a>.</p><p class="calibre8">Once Xcode has been installed, it can be launched from <code class="literal">/Applications/Xcode.app</code> or from Finder. To run the command line-based exercises, Terminal can be launched from /<code class="literal">Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app</code>, and if Xcode is installed successfully, <code class="literal">swift</code> can be launched by running <code class="literal">xcrun swift</code>.</p><p class="calibre8">The iOS applications can be developed and tested in the iOS simulator, which comes bundled with Xcode. It is not necessary to have an iOS device to write or test the code. If you want to run the code on your own iOS device, then you will need an Apple ID to sign in, but the application will be limited to directly connected devices. Similarly, the watch application can be tested in a local simulator or on a local device.</p><p class="calibre8">Publishing the application to the AppStore requires that you join the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Apple Developer Program</strong></span>.

However, after <a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 1. Exploring Swift" href="part0016_split_000.html#F8901-d7e55eb5242648e89c396442afe4f84b">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre11">Exploring Swift</em></span>, the remainder of the chapters use Xcode features or have iOS examples which can only be used on OS X with Xcode. These chapters show how to write iOS applications on OS X using Swift. No prior programming experience for iOS is assumed, though a basic level of programming experience in a dynamically or statically typed programming language is expected. The reader will be familiar with navigating and using Mac OS X and, in the cases where Terminal commands are required, the developer will have experience of simple shell commands or can pick it up quickly from the examples given.</p><p class="calibre8">Developers familiar with Objective-C will know many of the frameworks and libraries mentioned; however, existing knowledge of Objective-C and its frameworks is neither necessary nor assumed.</p><p class="calibre8">The sources are provided in a GitHub repository at <a class="calibre1" href="https://github.com/alblue/com.packtpub.swift.essentials/">https://github.com/alblue/com.packtpub.swift.essentials/</a>, and they can be used to switch between the content of chapters using the tags in the repository. Knowledge of Git is helpful if you are wanting to navigate between different versions; alternatively, the web-based interface at GitHub may be used instead. It is highly recommended that the reader becomes familiar with Git as it is the standard version control system for Xcode and the de facto standard for open source projects. The reader is invited to read the Git topics at the author's blog <a class="calibre1" href="http://alblue.bandlem.com/Tag/git/">http://alblue.bandlem.com/Tag/git/</a> if they are unfamiliar and interested in learning more.</p></div>
