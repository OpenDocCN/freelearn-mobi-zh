This chapter will show you how SQLite is exposed to other languages and frameworks and discuss the extensions of the C API, the usage of <a class="indexterm" id="id379"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>PhoneGap</strong></span>, and other cross-platform development environments. This chapter will also outline SQLite's other features and how SQLite has advanced to ensure that all those who use it can master it quickly.</p><p>You will also look at how SQLite has changed in recent years, how it has advanced to be integrated with a variety of existing technologies, and how its simple, easy-to-use formula has guaranteed its popularity to others. The amount of apps that use database technology, without disclosing the backend or local database, is incredible. SQLite, as will be shown later, has advanced to new levels and kept its simplicity but with developers pushing it to achieve new heights and popularity.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Firefox</strong></span><a class="indexterm" id="id380"/> and SQLite extensions to their browsers are available for administration purposes. SQLite has gone through several code changes, and in the future, it will continue to do so or be overtaken by something newer.</p><p>Adobe's Enterprise Management system works with PhoneGap, which uses SQLite. Because of its simple setup, there are several cases of SQLite using different technologies and integrating well.</p><p>The growth of relational database management systems to this date have been very strong, and if the data requires industrial strength, storage, and application, SQLite is the right format. However, in more recent years, solutions such as NOSQL, which purely rely on the data selected from technologies such as REST APIs or web services, have not used <span class="strong"><strong>RDBMS</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>relational database management system</strong></span>)<a class="indexterm" id="id381"/> to store their data. It will be retrieved and held in a file type structure, in effect, as its own version of RDMS. SQLite does not have the industrial support of tools like <span class="strong"><strong>database backup</strong></span><a class="indexterm" id="id382"/> or <a class="indexterm" id="id383"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>database recovery</strong></span>. In a world of mobile devices where the growth has been intensive and beating all types of expectation, SQLite is by far the easiest and quickest one to use with a minimum time spent learning.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Firefox SQLite Manager</strong></span><a class="indexterm" id="id384"/> facility is a good software extension to the browser. Once installed, it can serve as an aid to various processes of the database administrator.</p><p>Its simplicity and flexibility make it great for developing and testing. There is no mechanism to ensure performance, and it is possible to tune up the library. SQLite is great for embedded applications that are somewhat fixed, single user, mobile users, and gaming information storage.</p><p>It is easy to download and install SQLite. Once this is done, it gets fired up to work.</p><div class="section" title="PhoneGap plugins"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec62"/>PhoneGap plugins</h1></div></div></div><p>Before starting <a class="indexterm" id="id385"/>to develop a software for PhoneGap with SQLite, the environment must be set up properly for the PhoneGap framework to work correctly with SQLite. The PhoneGap environment will enable the SQLite database to be set up and connected with Xcode, toward the end, to produce an iOS application.</p><p>There is also a native SQLite plugin for PhoneGap, called<a class="indexterm" id="id386"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Brodysoft</strong></span> (refer to <a class="ulink" href="https://build.phonegap.com/plugins/2368">https://build.phonegap.com/plugins/2368</a>), that provides an interface for the storage <a class="indexterm" id="id387"/>and usage of the standard Web SQL database standards.</p><p>As the demand for mobile technology, mobile apps, and mobile development grows, the need for further advancement, with products such as PhoneGap, will be demanding the following, for example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">PhoneGap will have increased application size limits</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It will have support for different plugins, including the Cordova plugins repository <code class="literal">plugins.cordova.io</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Additional PhoneGap plugins may not have to go through an approval process and can be approved easily</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There will be a facility to upload your own plugins to your own development area so that you can test them privately</li></ul></div><p>To support additional plugins, which are more than 600 on the PhoneGap environment, the <code class="literal">source</code> attribute can be used.</p><p>PhoneGap plugins, unlike before, can contain compiled components such as frameworks, <code class="literal">.jar</code> files, and other related binaries. There is a lot of documentation about this procedure on the PhoneGap site. PhoneGap is now moving ahead with an <code class="literal">Amazon Mobile Ad Network</code> plugin, which will allow developers to monetize their app. This is because the <code class="literal">Amazon Ads</code> API has been created to be used within applications to facilitate advertising, and is a platform for this sole purpose. It will be used across different tablets, mobile devices, different utilities, and game apps.</p><p>The <code class="literal">cordova.xml</code> file used by <span class="strong"><strong>Cordova</strong></span><a class="indexterm" id="id388"/> or PhoneGap is the main parameter file where configuration changes are made to the environment.</p><p>For example, using the native Cordova/PhoneGap plugin for Android and iOS, the HTML5 Web SQL API can be used to code directly, as shown in the following. Here, the code is waiting to see if the <a class="indexterm" id="id389"/>API has been loaded before attempting to open the database:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;gap:plugin name="com.phonegap.plugins.example" version="0.3.3" source="plugins.cordova.io" /&gt;

// Wait for Cordova html5 plugin to load document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false); var db; function onDeviceReady() {   db1 = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "DB"}); }</pre></div><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"/>Note</h3><p>There is a plugin available and <a class="indexterm" id="id390"/>developed for the PhoneGap system <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage">https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage</a>. In order to use this plugin, add the following code to your <code class="literal">config.xml</code> file:</p></div></div><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"> &lt;gap:plugin name="com.millerjames01.sqlite-plugin" version="1.0.1"/&gt;</pre></div><p>This plugin is compatible with both iOS and Android operating systems and also works with Cordova.</p><p>The following piece of code is essential to ensure that a check is done, to see if the device is ready and if Cordova is ready to load:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">// Wait for Cordova to load document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
// Cordova is ready function onDeviceReady()
{   var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "DB"
}

);   // ... }</pre></div><p>Using the preceding plugin, it makes the inclusion of SQL directly into HTML5 easier and faster, as shown in the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Db.transaction(function(Tx1) {
  Tx1.executeSql("Create table if not exists" + " test(id integer primary key asc, newcolumn text, []);
});
}</pre></div><p>It becomes easy to add the necessary HTML content, and this works with both iOS and Android. The relationship between HTML5, SQLite, and PhoneGap to compile is an advancement of technology.</p><p>Not all the aspects <a class="indexterm" id="id391"/>of the <code class="literal">ALTER TABLE</code> statement are implemented in SQLite, and there is no support for the <code class="literal">GRANT</code> or <code class="literal">REVOKE</code> statements.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Extensions to the C API"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec63"/>Extensions to the C API</h1></div></div></div><p>SQLite binding functionality <a class="indexterm" id="id392"/>extends the popularity and diversity of the SQLite language, <a class="indexterm" id="id393"/>but it is not supported by the core developers of the database. Instead, the SQLite community takes care of these integrations, and is well-documented online. Scripting languages, such as Perl, PHP, and Python or Java, work nicely with SQLite.</p><p>The C API interface specification for SQLite has several interface elements and can be grouped into the following categories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Category one has a list of objects and datatypes utilized by the SQLite library. There are over a dozen objects and datatypes in it. The most meaningful and common ones are the database object called <code class="literal">sqlite3</code> and the prepare statement called <code class="literal">sqlite3_stmt.</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Category two will have its list of constants used by SQLite and are referenced by the usage of the <code class="literal">#defines</code> syntax in the <code class="literal">sqlite3.h</code> header file. These are standard constants, such as <code class="literal">SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY.</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Category three is a list of all the functions available and the methods they use within the objects, for returning values and usage of standard constants.</li></ul></div><p>For example, the <code class="literal">int sqlite3_sleep(int);</code> function is based on the number of milliseconds that it will suspend the execution of an instruction.</p><p>As mobiles become more powerful, there will always be an alteration to the amount of memory resources that SQLite can handle or use. The technology that is used within SQLite is called page cache. Now, page caching is important since this is how memory is used and set up for the SQLite performance. It has one I/O algorithm and two search algorithms. There is a binary search that uses the index of the table and full on brutal attack to read the full table. Since the limited decisions were made about how to write and implement them, and since it is more general and not designed for any specific application, the performance generally may not be equal to what is expected.</p><p>Although, SQLite does have an optimizer, it is not the most advanced of its type, but it is practical. In the following example, we see the creation of two tables and a join. We will use the <code class="literal">EXPLAIN</code> statement and then ask SQLite to see how it would get the results. As the results will begin to show, it will use one of the category formats discussed earlier in this section, which is just a major scan. It will only work properly if there is a <code class="literal">SELECT</code> statement with <code class="literal">JOIN</code> but with an index or a key on a simple query. On a complex query, you need to use the <code class="literal">EXPLAIN</code> statement. We just select one column from the first table and a scan of the whole table takes place:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE one (y, z);
sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE two (a, b);
sqlite&gt; EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT A FROM one JOIN two ON one.z = two.b WHERE y = 30;

0|0|TABLE one
1|1|TABLE two</pre></div><p>In terms of page cache, SQLite, as mentioned earlier, uses a disk with a page-based format. The cache along with SQLite is pulled from disk. There is no automatic recycling of pages; it can be reused once the page is empty. Also, if a page is reused again and again, it will become fragmented, and its data will be spread across the database file, which will decrease in terms of the performance.</p><p>As mentioned previously <a class="indexterm" id="id394"/>in this book, there is<a class="indexterm" id="id395"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Core Data</strong></span> from Apple, standard for iOS, but SQLite, which is free, is the dominant and cross-platform database solution for mobile.</p><p>With the advancement of new frameworks, there is a new technology, which aims to replace both: SQLite and Core Data. It is called <a class="indexterm" id="id396"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Realm</strong></span>. It is free for both iOS and Android and would be a good product to investigate. While the others maybe limited, this product must ensure that it is easy to set up, use, and administer. So far, it is being used by a variety of large e-commerce and data sites, such as Pinterest or BBC. <a class="ulink" href="http://Realm.io">Realm.io</a> is the <a class="indexterm" id="id397"/>location for this database software, is modern API for today's changeable market.</p><p>With Realm, there is a plugin for <a class="indexterm" id="id398"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Xcode</strong></span>, which seems to hook in and work well as per the demo. There is a complete API reference, which works with Objective-C, Swift, and Java. Realm also has its own Realm Browser from the Apple app store, which is used as an app to manage the databases, such as the Firefox plugin for SQLite.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Write Ahead Logging with SQLite"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec64"/>Write Ahead Logging with SQLite</h1></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Write Ahead Logging</strong></span> with <a class="indexterm" id="id399"/>SQLite, also known as <span class="strong"><strong>WAL</strong></span>, is the standard method that states how SQLite implements the <code class="literal">rollback</code> and <code class="literal">commit</code> processes with this mobile database system. The disk access and input and output operations are more sequential, using the <code class="literal">WAL</code> methods. Using <code class="literal">WAL</code> will involve less of the <code class="literal">fsync()</code> functions and operations. It means it is more likely to work properly on different operating systems and smartphones. <code class="literal">WAL</code> is faster on most operations and provides better concurrencies, as there are no conflicts with processes reading and writing at the same time with a big reduction in any data block.</p><p>As much as there are advantages, there are also limitations to this method. <code class="literal">WAL</code> does not work efficiently with very large transactions, but much better with smaller transactions. For transactions of around 100 megabytes, it will work fine, but over a gigabyte, it will start to reduce its efficiency. There is also another issue: <code class="literal">WAL</code> could fail operations if it encounters a <span class="emphasis"><em>disk full</em></span> error, although, an extra operation is<a class="indexterm" id="id400"/> <span class="strong"><strong>checkpointing</strong></span>, which is embedded as a part of the system. Developers need to be aware of this checkpointing.</p><p><code class="literal">WAL</code> and <code class="literal">rollback</code> may be <a class="indexterm" id="id401"/>slower than the current/traditional method of operation. This is because of the amount of reads and low attempts of writes on the database. This is only in the range of 1-2%. Another disadvantage is that the database page size cannot be changed when using the WAL mode even if it is an empty database. To resolve the problem, you have to restore from a backup using the provided <span class="strong"><strong>BACKUP API</strong></span><a class="indexterm" id="id402"/>, and you must be in a rollback journal mode in order to succeed. There is<a class="indexterm" id="id403"/> also a problem reading the <span class="strong"><strong>read-only WAL</strong></span> databases.</p><p><code class="literal">WAL</code> works by creating and writing up a copy of the original database with no changes into a new/separate rollback journal file. Changes are then directly made to the database file. If there is a crash and the system has to perform the <code class="literal">rollback</code> operation, then the unchanged original version is played back to the database file, which will change to its original state. The <code class="literal">commit</code> operation is done when the rollback journal is deleted. It is quite an effective procedure. Transactions writing to disk are always fast because the content is written only once.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="The B-tree usage with SQLite"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec65"/>The B-tree usage with SQLite</h1></div></div></div><p>The arbitrary storage of leaf nodes and its location on the <a class="indexterm" id="id404"/>actual disk will not link up or respond to the index order or any logical positioning. Therefore, a database search algorithm is used with the right structure, to change the position and quickly output a balanced search tree or, in short, a B-tree. Each branch of data will have its leaf nodes that link or refer to the memory location that is used to store each and every table of the database.</p><p>B-tree allows sequential access, deletions, and insertions, based on the general binary search tree in a node that can have two or more children. When data is removed or added, the number of child nodes will change, and in order to maintain a specific range, some internal nodes may join or split. Every internal node within a B-tree structure will have a number of keys. Each of these keys will have a value and will be divided into subtrees. B-tree is a good way to search for data with a key associated to find the right data, but it is inefficient at search data with a query string; it uses an index to speed up this searching. B-trees are an efficient way of searching data with a key, and when executed correctly, they become very quick. This is an explanation<a class="indexterm" id="id405"/> about B-tree and how it is applied with SQLite.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating a simple Swift"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec66"/>Creating a simple Swift</h1></div></div></div><p>With the advent of Swift and Swift2, there<a class="indexterm" id="id406"/> is the use of an environment called a <a class="indexterm" id="id407"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>playground</strong></span> now. It is a place where you can set up a quick environment with some code and then see the results. It is a quick, new way to use the new setup. When you start, it will have a main window and the results on the second, split one.</p><p>In Xcode, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Playground</strong></span> and the following screenshot will be shown. Give a name to your playground. You can have several running of them under different platforms, so a meaningful name would be useful:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Creating a simple Swift" src="graphics/4725_08_01.jpg"/></div><p>Once this is created and the <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> button is clicked on, the following screen will appear. Here, you can create the code, test ideas and code snippets, and just try it out. It is a great and simple idea, which will help motivate existing developers, and create new developers for the future:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Creating a simple Swift" src="graphics/4725_08_02.jpg"/></div><p>As you can see from the <a class="indexterm" id="id408"/>preceding screenshot, there is a split page on the right-hand side, which can be adjusted as per requirement. The code appears on the left-hand side, and the results appear on the right-hand side. In the preceding code, a call to <code class="literal">UIKIT</code> is made; the next line creates a variable called <code class="literal">str</code> and has a default string value of <code class="literal">Hello playground</code>.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>UIKit</strong></span><a class="indexterm" id="id409"/> is the core foundation of iOS framework that is used for on app development. After <code class="literal">var</code> is defined as <code class="literal">str</code> to equal <code class="literal">Hello Playground</code> in order to change, it should be defined as <code class="literal">str = New Playground</code>, which will reassign the variable to a new value. Creating a default system, using the <code class="literal">var</code> statement, and then assigning it, shows that the default variable value can be changed. However, if you use the <code class="literal">let</code> statement to say <code class="literal">let str =new play</code> and straight after that add <code class="literal">str =newnewplay line</code>, the system would throw an error, because you cannot change the value of a constant with the <code class="literal">let</code> command.</p><p>The playground can accept different types of data types, as you would imagine, making it a fun but productive way to get into development or test new ideas. In the next simple example, a variable called <code class="literal">age</code>, with a datatype of <code class="literal">int</code>, is set up.</p><p>A default value of <code class="literal">25</code> is given to this value. Then, take the value of age and multiply it by <code class="literal">10</code>, and you will get a new value of <code class="literal">250</code>, as shown in the following screenshot. This is the beauty of the playground:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Creating a simple Swift" src="graphics/4725_08_03.jpg"/></div><p>Swift has a good range of comparison operators, just as most languages, but you can use the <code class="literal">= </code>and <code class="literal">&gt;</code> ways or the <code class="literal">&lt;</code> way as well, as shown the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Creating a simple Swift" src="graphics/4725_08_04.jpg"/></div><p>The Swift interpolation is <a class="indexterm" id="id410"/>also easier with Swift. By creating a variable and then using the command to print the name , for example, by using the <code class="literal">\(name)</code> where name is variable name, as shown in the following screenshot. It is easy, but it is good to practice this again and again so that the information is locked inside your mind:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Creating a simple Swift" src="graphics/4725_08_05.jpg"/></div><p>As shown in the following<a class="indexterm" id="id411"/> screenshot, the usage of the <code class="literal">+</code> concatenation does not work in Swift, especially the merging of string, doubles, or integers. But the expression in the next image clearly shows how <code class="literal">\</code> between the <code class="literal">name</code>, <code class="literal">age</code>, or <code class="literal">latitude</code> can be a part of the correct syntax, expressing the output properly:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Creating a simple Swift" src="graphics/4725_08_06.jpg"/></div><p>The use of arrays is easier in Swift, and these arrays will store a collection of data, such as a grid, as a part of a big collection of information. An array called <code class="literal">oddNumbers</code> will have four figures, such as <code class="literal">(3, 5, 7, 9)</code>. There will be another array called <code class="literal">songs</code>, as shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Creating a simple Swift" src="graphics/4725_08_07.jpg"/></div><p>The Swift language is<a class="indexterm" id="id412"/> vast and has many examples, but we can't cover all of them in this short chapter. This chapter will show you the updates from SQLite, PhoneGap, and some updates on Swift.</p><p>For example, the <code class="literal">for</code> loop is an easier one to use, which is clearly shown in the following scrweenshot. In this statement, the print statement would have run 10 times as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p> </p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Creating a simple Swift" src="graphics/4725_08_08.jpg"/></div><p>Here is another example of trying to use the <code class="literal">for</code> command where the number in the loop is not required and <code class="literal">_ </code>is used instead. But, the <code class="literal">str</code> print command has completed its execution five times because the word <code class="literal">gone</code> was sought, printed, and concatenated, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Creating a simple Swift" src="graphics/4725_08_09.jpg"/></div><p>As mentioned previously, the use of playgrounds will be—as the name suggests— <span class="emphasis"><em>Swift and fun to use</em></span>.</p><p>Just cut and paste it in code and then run it. From Xcode 7 and beyond, the actual code that you can put into playgrounds will be rich, have comments, and be much more than pseudo coding, because it can be added into your apps.</p><p>You will be able to add rich text features, comments, and other necessary text that will aid the development and creativity of the programming process.</p><p>Imagine that when an update of an API is released, it will be a great and fast way to look at the API and write or hack some code to make it work in playground. Apart from being informative and quick, it will also serve as a training tool for you and your colleagues. It will boost training sessions, and enable developers to try new ideas and programming code without hindrance to others and their common projects.</p><p>What a beautifully interactive<a class="indexterm" id="id413"/> and modern way to learn and use the existing programming skills to gain new knowledge. The usage and availability of an interactive debugging console in Swift allows a change/enhancement to the product that modernizes its efforts.</p><p>Since it was designed from the ground up, Swift aimed to be quick, fast in action and coding, and work with both the Objective-C interoperability and Swift to include and shared libraries, code, and values, as modern 21st century compiler will aid its dominance in the coming years. Objective-C and Swift code can co-exist and work together or separately.</p><p>The built-in high performance compiler has been created to maximize the Apple hardware, protocols, and network availability. It is optimized to run very quickly and improve development and compilation speeds.</p><p>As part of its portfolio, the Swift language is one of the most modern languages, using the "best of" other scripting languages and removing problems such as poor performance, or syntax related issues to move on from the C and Objective-C code paradigm. There are many languages out there. But Swift is the only one where you can code and learn in a modern way. By learning now, you are preparing for the near future, where this language will be popular. It is a full successor to Objective-C and C-related languages.</p><p>Swift has been designed to be modern and opt out of the functionality that would actually stop a programmer developing. So, all the stops for slow development are extinct. For example, all values are, by default, not null. The use of safety for the language has been encouraged and built as part of the software, for example, a variable uses the <code class="literal">var</code> statement, and the <code class="literal">let</code> statement will be there for constants. When defining any "Swift" object for example, the value won't be nil because the compiler will deal with it and set it as a part of the safety regime. Enforcing these types of niceties encourages better, professional, cleaner, fun, and innovative code.</p><p>Swift has a superbly modern and much-improved error-handling model that will provide a clear and concise way to develop and gain modern skills using state-of-the-art, object-oriented technology. It also captures any necessary error so that the program does not crash, and deal with it. It works nicely with <span class="strong"><strong>NSError</strong></span><a class="indexterm" id="id414"/> and other related iOS frameworks. For example, see the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">func UnloadData() throws { }

func zTest() {
    do {
        try UnloadData()
    } catch {
        print(error)
    }
}</pre></div><p>Swift2 has now been made open source, which will encourage many more users, on many different platforms, to architect, design, and develop software. It will enable Apple to get into areas of development often used by their competitors in the market place. It will have a huge following, and more so when those faithful Objective-C programmers change to Swift.</p><p>New, interesting, and heavy <a class="indexterm" id="id415"/>duty code can be written in Swift using some great and powerful language/syntax, with commands such as <code class="literal">repeat</code>, <code class="literal">defer</code>, and <code class="literal">guard</code>. Apple is also providing a migration tool to convert code to new playgrounds and application development code for easy execution. These are some of the benefits that await us for development using Swift2.</p><p>Swift is designed to be modern, Swift2 uses information, functionality, and the compiler development from modern research, programming languages, and previous experience of different Apple development, product and coding skills. A modern approach, and the ability to structure extensions and protocols, will ensure that it is around for some time.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec67"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, you learned some advanced aspects and future advances of SQLite and how it fits with the current cross-platform development. The chapter outlines the changes of SQLite and its growth and links with PhoneGap. PhoneGap also has integrated with content management systems, such as Adobe Enterprise Manager, which has had several advances in technology, and client license purchases have rocketed its popularity. In this chapter, you have also touched on what is possible in the new Swift language and how it will affect the future of games, apps, and utilities.</p></div></body></html>
