- en: This book will provide you with all the necessary skills to develop and deploy
    rich and powerful applications for the iPhone and iPad, with the C# programming
    language. Xamarin.iOS, formerly known as MonoTouch, is already established as
    a powerful software development kit that brings iOS development to .NET programmers.
    Packed with easy-to-understand and detailed examples, this book will be your best
    companion in your iOS development journey.
