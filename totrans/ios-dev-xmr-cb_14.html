An Apple Developer enrolled to the iOS Developer Program can add up to 100 devices and include them in a provisioning profile.</p><p>The App ID is the identifier of your app. Create one App ID for each of your apps.</p><p>The provisioning profile is the electronic signature that allows your app to be deployed to the device. Each provisioning profile corresponds to one app and holds all the appropriate permissions that will allow the app to execute on the device(s) included in it and the App ID information. It is also what distinguishes an app for development or distribution. Provisioning profiles are issued with an expiration time. At the time of writing this book, the duration of a provisioning profile is 1 year.</p></div><div class="section" title="There's more..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch14lvl2sec471"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>To compile and debug an app on the device, select the developer certificate and provisioning profile in Xamarin Studio under the <span class="strong"><strong>iPhone Bundle Signing</strong></span> node in project options, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8924OT_14_03.jpg" alt="There's more..."/></div><p>This has<a id="id753" class="indexterm"/> to be done for each build configuration (<span class="strong"><strong>Debug</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Release</strong></span>, and so on).</p><p>Under the <span class="strong"><strong>iPhone Application</strong></span> node, set the <span class="strong"><strong>Display name</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Bundle Identifier</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Bundle version</strong></span> fields for your app. If you leave them blank, Xamarin Studio will set their values to default. Specifically, the <span class="strong"><strong>Bundle Identifier</strong></span> field will be set to the one that is included in the App ID.

The following steps will guide you through the process:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Create a distribution certificate. For distributing apps to various devices that are not connected to your Mac, but also for submitting to the App Store, you need a distribution certificate to be installed. Follow the same steps described in the previous recipe for creating a developer certificate.

It is time to share it with our testers. The following steps will guide you through the process:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">On the Mac, open Finder and navigate to the <code class="literal">bin</code> folder of your project.</li><li class="listitem">Open the <code class="literal">iPhone/Ad-Hoc</code> folder.</li><li class="listitem">You can now send the <code class="literal">*.ipa</code> file, along with the provisioning profile file (<code class="literal">*.mobileprovision</code>) to the tester(s).</li><li class="listitem">The tester(s) will be able to install the app by dragging-and-dropping both files in iTunes and syncing them with the device.</li></ol></div></div><div class="section" title="How it works..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch14lvl2sec475"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>For<a id="id757" class="indexterm"/> distributing apps, we need a distribution certificate. Just like the developer certificate, the distribution certificate is created once, but can be transferred to another Mac if needed.</p><p>The creation process of the ad hoc distribution provisioning profile is the same as the process of creating development provisioning profiles. The only difference is that we have the option of the type of distribution, which is either <span class="strong"><strong>App Store</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Ad Hoc</strong></span>. The <code class="literal">*.ipa</code> file is a file that is recognized by iTunes.</p></div><div class="section" title="There's more..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch14lvl2sec476"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>There is also a third-party service that makes the distribution process very easy.

This is the icon that will represent your app on the users' devices. Depending on the target device, the dimensions of the icon should be different. Xamarin Studio makes this process easy by providing specific slots for assigning the icon for each target device/platform. For example, the icon size for an iPhone 3s is different from the size for an iPhone 4s, as is the icon for an iPhone 5 or a later device running on iOS 7.</p><p>The following steps will guide you through the process:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Double-click on the <code class="literal">Info.plist</code> file of your project to open the file in the embedded editor. The following screenshot shows all the available options for app icons in a universal (iPhone and iPad) app:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8924OT_14_06.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></li><li class="listitem">Click on each corresponding icon to assign the icon. The icons must be in the PNG format.</li><li class="listitem">Now that we have set the app icon, we need to set a launch image.</li><li class="listitem">The launch image is the first thing that is displayed when an app starts. Prepare a launch image in at least two dimensions for the iPhone and iPod Touch apps: 320 x 480 pixels for the lower resolution version, 640 x 960 pixels for the higher resolution version, and 640 x 1136 pixels for the 4-inch devices (iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, and so on).</li><li class="listitem">Click on the corresponding box in the <code class="literal">Info.plist</code> editor to set the launch image.</li></ol></div><p>We now have to set the iTunes Artwork image. This is a 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 image that will be displayed on our app's page on iTunes. It can be whatever you want; however, a good practice is to make it the same as the app icon. Just click on the corresponding button in the <code class="literal">Info.plist</code> file to assign the iTunes Artwork images.</p></div><div class="section" title="How it works..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch14lvl2sec480"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id763" class="indexterm"/> application icons are very important. It is what the user <a id="id764" class="indexterm"/>will see on the device's screen and tap to start your app. Although all app icons appear as buttons with rounded corners and a lighting effect, you should not include these graphical features in your icons. These graphical features are automatically rendered upon app submission to the App Store. The icons should be perfect squares. Also, always provide a background for the icons. Do not use transparencies, because any transparencies on the icon will be displayed with black color, potentially destroying your intended icon appearance.</p><p>The launch image is displayed first when the app starts. When a screen goes blank at startup, it means there is no launch image. According to Apple's <span class="strong"><strong>iOS Human Interface Guidelines</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html</a>), this image should be the first screen that is loaded when the app completes the launch process and is ready to accept input. It should only contain the static content of the first screen and not the content that is likely to change, like localized text.</p></div><div class="section" title="There's more..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch14lvl2sec481"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>It is not mandatory to create your app icon for each available slot in the editor. In fact, even if you just create only one low-resolution icon, it will be acceptable, and you will be able to upload your app to the App Store. Its quality though, when installed on a high-resolution device such as the iPad Air, is not going to be top-notch. This is not good for the reputation of both the app and its developer, unfortunately.</p><div class="section" title="The 4-inch screen launch image"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch14lvl3sec117"/>The 4-inch screen launch image</h3></div></div></div><p>As you<a id="id765" class="indexterm"/> may have already noticed, the <code class="literal">Info.plist</code> editor<a id="id766" class="indexterm"/> has a launch image already set for retina (4-inch) screens, which is a plain black background. This is because when the iPhone 5 was first launched, it was a device with a screen height that was different from that of the previous models.</p><p>The way Apple chose to help developers easily support the taller screen required developers to include a launch image in the dimensions of the new screen. This way, iOS automatically sizes the view controllers to the new screen size upon startup. By including this <a id="id767" class="indexterm"/>blank launch image by default, Xamarin Studio makes our life easier so that all our projects appear properly on the 4-inch devices.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="See also"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch14lvl2sec482"/>See also</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating profiles</em></span> recipe</li></ul></div></div></div>

The keywords and description are the parameters that will allow your app to come <a id="id774" class="indexterm"/>up higher on search results and make the user decide <a id="id775" class="indexterm"/>whether the app is worth the download. Regarding the keywords, choose them wisely. Do not include as many as you can; fewer keywords that reflect the key aspects of the app are always better.</p><p>iTunes Connect is the developer portal for managing applications, reviewing financial data, app downloads, and it includes the contracts and agreements a developer needs to sign. Make sure you read and accept the contracts, or else you will not be able to proceed with the app's preparation process. During this process, you are required to provide the necessary information, for your app it includes, the price range if it is a paid app, the countries in which it will be available, as well as the release date for it if you do not want it to be released automatically as soon as it has passed through the App Store review process.</p><p>When everything is set up correctly and the app's status is <span class="strong"><strong>Waiting for Upload</strong></span>, you can then run the Application Loader to upload it. Periodically and with each release of iOS and iOS SDK versions, various components or procedures change. Always make sure that your iOS SDK version is up-to-date.</p></div><div class="section" title="There's more..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch14lvl2sec486"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>At some point in the app's preparation process, you will be required to enter a <span class="strong"><strong>Stock Keeping Unit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SKU</strong></span>)<a id="id776" class="indexterm"/> number.
