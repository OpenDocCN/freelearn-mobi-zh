			<p class="calibre3">It has been many years since Apple introduced its first SDK for iPhone development (which is what iOS used to be called back then), and in that time, the iOS ecosystem has become one of the most powerful ecosystems in the world. With the goal of supporting billions of devices with up-to-date technologies, the demand for iOS developers remains <span>constantly high.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">However, things have become much more complex. In 2009, adding a simple table view or a button would have been enough to land a job. However, nowadays, these tasks are not even asked about in interviews. The knowledge spectrum is so wide today that interviewers focus on aspects beyond just <span>basic knowledge.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The complexity of today’s iOS development world, combined with strong competition, has created a diverse hiring process that requires more than just building a simple screen. As a result, there is a great need to prepare ourselves in a professional and <span>extensive way.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><em class="italic">The Ultimate iOS Interview Playbook</em> is a comprehensive book that guides you from the early basics of interview preparation to Swift, the different frameworks, and even design, architecture, and <span>coding tasks.</span></p>
			<div class="calibre8"/><h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="calibre5"><a id="_idTextAnchor006" class="calibre6 pcalibre pcalibre1"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">iOS developers at all levels will find this book appealing and useful. However, there are three types of developers who will find it even <span>more valuable:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre10">
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Junior developers seeking their first job</strong>: Finding your first job as an iOS developer can be challenging. While workplaces understand that junior developers may not have extensive experience, they still expect them to possess the minimum skills and knowledge required for the role. <em class="italic">The Ultimate iOS Interview Playbook</em> can assist inexperienced developers in successfully navigating this difficult task.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Experienced developers who feel stuck in their career</strong>: Spending several years in the same workplace or role can have its benefits, but it may also lead to a decline in interview skills and hinder growth in new development areas. Moreover, for experienced developers, it has been a long time since they completed their studies, making it a good opportunity to revisit the basics.</li>
				<li class="calibre11"><strong class="bold">Developers looking to advance their careers</strong>: Those who view their specialization as a long-term career path need to take the next step to progress. Seeking a new role is not an easy task, especially while working full-time and trying to build your personal brand.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">In summary, the book caters to a wide range of iOS developers, but these particular groups can benefit greatly from <em class="italic">The Ultimate iOS </em><span><em class="italic">Interview Playbook</em></span><span>.</span></p>
