<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec03"/>Importing textures</h1></div></div></div><p>A mobile graphics hardware works with different formats and handles textures differently than a normal PC graphics hardware. By taking the necessary precautions and creating textures accordingly, many obstacles can be avoided. Now, I'm by no means an art expert but I'll briefly go over some things that you should abide by if you do decide to do your own textures for iOS.<a class="indexterm" id="id393"/>
</p><p>When creating your own textures it is important to make the size of the image in powers of two such as 256, 512, 1024, and 2048. Computers process data in "chunks" for purposes of efficiency. For game content creation, on devices mobile especially, if a texture is not in a power of two Unreal will waste resources both in terms of time and processing power in order fix the problem. In effect the essence of the power of two rule is optimization, being as efficient and as "lite" as possible while providing the user an appropriate visual experience. When working with iOS, hardware textures can have a size of up to 2048 by 2048 but use them sparingly. This is particularly important in the case of games targeting lower end devices (such as iPhone 3GS, iPad 1, and iPod touch 4th generation) that only have 256 MB of RAM.<a class="indexterm" id="id394"/>
</p><p>The following texture formats are supported:<code class="literal"> .bmp, .pcx, .png, .tga, .float</code> and<code class="literal"> .psd</code>.<a class="indexterm" id="id395"/>
</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec04"/>Time for action—finishing the main menu</h1></div></div></div><p>That being said, let's import our first texture into the game:<a class="indexterm" id="id396"/>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec05"/>Adding sounds</h1></div></div></div><p>Something that many people take for granted, sound, can have a massive effect on people when they are playing your game. To give you a taste of how simple it is to add sounds to your game let's add one when we start the game.</p><p>However, just because it is easy to add sounds to our game, playing sounds on iOS devices is quite hard to do—it takes a lot of computing as an iOS device is only able to play one at a time; this is because sounds that are played are uncompressed. This is unlike music that you listen to on your computer (unless you are an audiophile) which is compressed in a format like MP3 which uses a compression algorithm to keep the size of files small. However, having uncompressed sounds makes the files a lot larger. Initializing multiple sounds in the same frame can cause a lot of performance problems. It is a good idea to not play multiple sounds at once if you can help it. This being said, you're going to want to make them as small as possible. Using 22 kHz sounds over 44 kHz sounds on iOS is an easy way to gain a lot of performance that would otherwise be going into processing the sound files. Given that the typical use case of an iOS device is either going to be over the bad speaker or bad headphones included with the device, you can gain a lot of performance for minimal sound difference.<a class="indexterm" id="id407"/>
</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec06"/>Time for action—playing a sound effect</h1></div></div></div><p>We want the player to know that we have understood him/her tapping to start the game. Let's play a sound to show him/her we know. We can do this as follows:<a class="indexterm" id="id408"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open up the<strong> Content Browser</strong> by either selecting its icon or going to the<strong> View</strong> menu and selecting<strong> View</strong> |<strong> Browser Windows | Content Browser</strong> .

In the window that pops up set the package with the same name that you just created and open up the tab in the Options menu and check<strong> Auto Create Cue</strong> then click on<strong> OK</strong>, saying yes if it asks you to import the entire package.<div><img alt="Time for action—playing a sound effect" src="img/1901_07_17.jpg" width="238"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Right-click on the package name on the left-hand side of the<strong> Content Browser</strong> and save our package by selecting<strong> Save</strong> on the menu.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec07"/>Customizing sounds</h1></div></div></div><p>Note that the way that I'm doing sound right now doesn't take into account the sound's position in space. This doesn't matter since the sound is going to be playing directly at the player, but if you wanted to, you can edit the<strong> SoundCue</strong> by right-clicking on it in the<strong> Content Browser</strong> and selecting<strong> Edit Using SoundCue Editor</strong>.<a class="indexterm" id="id411"/>
</p><p>The SoundCue Editor is very similar to Kismet other than the fact that the only event called is when it is played which is shown by an image of a Speaker. The<strong> attenuation</strong> feature can be applied to events in order to put a given sound into world space instead of it always being the same. However, this can only work if the sound is a mono sound.<a class="indexterm" id="id412"/>
</p><div><img alt="Customizing sounds" src="img/1901_07_20.jpg" width="396"/></div><p>Once this is set it is possible to drag-and-drop a SoundCue inside a level, into the game world. So if you would like to add sound effects in your level that way you are welcome to try this and when you go around your level the sound will become louder and shift location based on where you are in the game world. There are plenty of other features to look at here, such as randomizers, but we'll only be playing a simple sound here. Play around with it in your own time or look at the Sound Cues that Epic provides with UDK to see the possible things you can do, such as adding modulation and variation to sounds, just like the gun shots sound different depending on your location in the game world, when you fire them. Have fun with it!<a class="indexterm" id="id413"/>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec08"/>Adding music</h1></div></div></div><p>Similar to sound, music is done slightly differently on iOS than they are done for the PC. Since mobiles are usually media players they have hardware that specifically works with playing music efficiently, but the mobile platform is also limited in what it can do. Let's first add some music to our level.<a class="indexterm" id="id414"/>
</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec09"/>Time for action—adding a background music track</h1></div></div></div><p>Now, mobile devices have dedicated sound hardware for compressed sounds. iOS devices can play back one compressed stream at a time with little to no cost, so it will be our job to create music that works well in that regard. However, MP3 files do not work in the PC version of Unreal in either the editor or main game so I will be showing you how to add music in the Editor as well. We can do this as follows:<a class="indexterm" id="id415"/>

Connect the<strong> Normal</strong> option from the<strong> PreviewMaterial_0</strong> to the black connector of the new<strong> Texture Sample</strong>.<p>You will notice that our Material now looks like it has depth to it. That is because a normal map is a technique used for faking the lighting of bumps and dents. It is used to add details without using more polygons and what you see now is how it would look if you played your game on PC. When playing the game on iOS, UDK will attempt to bake it into the lightmap used by the level using the PC materials normal map, while the advanced effects use the normal map slot under the <strong>Mobile</strong> section of the material editor.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec14"/>Optimizations</h1></div></div></div><p>There are a ton of resources on how to optimize your game and plenty of discussions on forums of the best ways to do things. In the following sections I will talk about different aspects that I use in order to optimize my games.<a class="indexterm" id="id436"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec07"/>Console commands—statistics</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the neat new additions to UDK in terms of mobiles is the fact that by holding four fingers on the screen at a time you can open up the console window. You can find a list of console commands you can use in UDK at <a class="ulink" href="http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/ConsoleCommands.html">http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/ConsoleCommands.html</a>. Also note that the values you may see on the PC are in no way an indicator of how things will be on an iOS device so be sure to do your testing by either using the four-finger process or calling the<code class="literal"> Console Command</code> in Kismet. The following are some of the stats that I found most useful when debugging projects.<a class="indexterm" id="id437"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec01"/>stat fps</h3></div></div></div><p>The easiest one to see why we would want it, the FPS counter tells us how many frames per second our game runs. 24 frames per second is the accepted threshold where animation becomes possible, if it is much less, the visuals seems jagged or our brains can tell that they are just images. 30 FPS is an accepted standard in most Unreal games, though some have been able to do 60.<a class="indexterm" id="id438"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec02"/>stat game</h3></div></div></div><p>This shows statistics related to the time it takes to run different parts of the game, which may make it easier to see which sections of the game are taking the longest to run with the number of checkmarks, and the time it takes to do certain things such as Kismet and UnrealScript.<a class="indexterm" id="id439"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec03"/>stat memory</h3></div></div></div><p>This shows how much memory is being used by each individual section of the game. The larger the memory, the more processing power it takes to use and the larger your game will be. Apple only allows you to download apps that are 50 MB or less through 3G/4G, so having an app with a size larger than this will force it to be downloaded through WiFi, which will probably be how your game will wind up, due to the size of UDK, but it still is a good idea to keep your memory footprint low.<a class="indexterm" id="id440"/>
</p><div><img alt="stat memory" height="213" src="img/1901_07_37.jpg"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec04"/>stat es2</h3></div></div></div><p>OpenGL ES2 is the iOS rendering device and while inside the Mobile Previewer it may crash when run on an iOS device. You can see useful data in terms of how many draw calls are done as well other useful stats to see. Try to keep your draw calls down as low as you can as it will probably be the thing that slows your game down the most.<a class="indexterm" id="id441"/>
</p><div><img alt="stat es2" height="216" src="img/1901_07_38.jpg"/></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec08"/>Combining meshes</h2></div></div></div><p>Speaking of draw calls, we have just learned how to create meshes in our game project earlier in this chapter. When wanting to optimize our game, it may be a good idea to combine similar meshes that contain the same texture together as long as it is still low poly. Having fewer meshes reduces the amount of draw calls that need to be made. In the same regard, reduce the amount of materials that you use on an individual object, constraining yourself to only one Material per object if you possibly can. Using multiple materials on an object at the very least doubles the amount of memory needed to compute and run it, which is not a very good thing when you're trying to make your game as efficient as possible.<a class="indexterm" id="id442"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec09"/>Precomputed visibility</h2></div></div></div><p>Hardware occlusion queries are appealing in games because they work in completely dynamic scenes, but sadly iOS devices do not support occluding objects. By occluding objects I mean that if the player does not see an object, the game can skip drawing that object. While our little game happens to run fine, larger projects will want to make use of this feature as it can greatly improve runtimes. To learn how to set precomputed visibility in your game, see: <a class="ulink" href="http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/PrecomputedVisibility.html">http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/PrecomputedVisibility.html</a>.<a class="indexterm" id="id443"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec10"/>Streaming volumes</h2></div></div></div><p>While we're on the topic of larger levels, by far the best way in my opinion to create larger levels is by using streaming volumes. What that basically does is make it so that when you enter a certain area of the world, a level will be loaded. However, in the transition between levels there may be a time when more than one level is open which will lower your frame rate drastically. I personally create small areas in between my larger levels that contain parts of both levels that make the transition more seamless and less of a hog on memory all at once. For more information on streaming volumes and how to set it up, check out: <a class="ulink" href="http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/LevelStreamingVolumes.html">http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/LevelStreamingVolumes.html</a>

</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec15"/>Debugging</h1></div></div></div><p>Being able to debug your game doesn't seem that important, until something in your game breaks. Having a firm grounding in ways to see what is going on in your game will definitely help you later on down the road as you delve into projects of your own.<a class="indexterm" id="id445"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec11"/>Comment your code</h2></div></div></div><p>This is something that was drilled into me in college and advice I am very thankful for taking. Chances are that while working on any large project you are not going to be touching a particular sequence in Kismet every day. Weeks are going to go by and you are going to forget why certain things were done. This is just as applicable to Kismet as it is to any other kind of programming language, and thankfully Unreal gives us the ability to make it simple to tell others what is going on. Selecting multiple objects and then right-clicking and selecting<strong> Comment</strong> allows you to type something in, which can give a clue into what a group of Kismet nodes are used for, such as this reworked Player Spawned event:<a class="indexterm" id="id446"/>
</p><div><img alt="Comment your code" height="116" src="img/1901_07_39.jpg"/></div><p>I also added in object comments at the end of the different input zones, for example I did this when I put in the push button example, except I didn't trigger the output on the screen. Now it is used so that when I glance at the code I know what I'm adding. Cleaning up the code that we did during the project I came up with this:<a class="indexterm" id="id447"/>
</p><div><img alt="Comment your code" src="img/1901_07_40.jpg" width="131"/></div><p>Even with a glance it is always better to look at than having no guidance at all, making it simple to find what you're looking for either there or in any of the subsequences we created. You could even take this idea further, creating subsequences for each of the different items, but that's more of finding what you're comfortable with and getting accustomed to your own style of doing things.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec12"/>Captain's log</h2></div></div></div><p>Now, there will come a time where you are sure everything is correct and all of your Kismet actions are being called. Well, there's one way to be sure of the value that something is, and that's by logging it and displaying what the data is at runtime. You can create a<strong> Log</strong> action by going into<strong> New Action</strong> |<strong> Misc</strong> |<strong> Log</strong>. From there you can right-click on the object and select<strong> Expose Variable</strong> and choose a type of something you'd like to get the value of. With that if you set the<strong> Target</strong> to<strong> Player 0</strong> and the other item to some of that type, when you play the game and it is called, the game will display what it is. For example when I add a<strong> Log</strong> action to this event:<a class="indexterm" id="id448"/>
</p><div><img alt="Captain's log" height="220" src="img/1901_07_41.jpg"/></div><p>
<code class="literal">UTPawn_0</code> gets displayed in the log. This is the name of the object that we put in the object variable link of the Log action.<a class="indexterm" id="id449"/>
</p><div><img alt="Captain's log" src="img/1901_07_42.jpg" width="282"/></div><p>Being able to make sure that an object has a value you think it should have is one of the most obvious ways to tell if something is wrong, other than it not being called at all, of course.<a class="indexterm" id="id450"/>
</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec16"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Our game is now effectively our own, or at least on its way to being our own. With this knowledge I'm confident that you are more than ready to build your game to be as large as you'd like as well as inputting all sorts of custom stuff into the game.
