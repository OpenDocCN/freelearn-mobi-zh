It's one step closer to sharing it with the rest of the world so other people can play your new app. The benefit of creating your game with Corona SDK is that you have the option to build for iOS and/or Android. You want to ensure your application is ready for submission so it can be distributed in the mobile platform you're developing in. We'll go over the process of what it takes to prepare your game for its release state.</p></blockquote></div><p>In this chapter, we will learn the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Improve performance of your application</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Set up a distribution provisioning profile for the App Store</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Manage application information in iTunes Connect</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Learn how to submit an application to application loader</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Sign applications for Android</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Learn how to submit an application to the Google Play Store</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec01"/>Understanding memory efficiency</h1></div></div></div><p>As you develop your application, you should always consider how your design choices affect the performance of your application. Device memory still has its constraints even though there are improvements in computing power and memory. Performance and optimization within the device will not only achieve faster response times, but also help minimize memory usage and maximize battery life.<a id="id660" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Memory is an important resource on mobile devices. When too much memory is being consumed, devices may force quit your application when you least expect it. Here are some things to be aware of while developing:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Eliminate memory leaks:</strong> Allowing leaks to exist means extra used memory in your application that takes up valuable space. Even though Lua does automatic memory management, memory leaks can still occur in your code. For example, when you introduce global variables into your application, it is your job to tell Lua when they are not needed anymore so memory can be freed. This is done through using <code class="literal">nil</code> in your code <code class="literal">(myVariable = nil)</code>.<a id="id661" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Display images should be made as small as possible:</strong> You may want to have many display images in your scene, but it may take up too much texture memory. Sprite sheets can take a toll on taking up a lot of memory in your apps. They should also be created at the smallest size as conveniently possible and have the appropriate amount of frames that demonstrate the animation clearly. For all items that you have displayed, plan out which elements are constantly in your background and foreground. If there is a way to combine several images together if they don't move, do so. It'll save some memory when adding multiple display images.<a id="id662" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Do not load all your resources all at once:</strong> Avoid loading resource files until they are actually needed. This will help save memory and keep your application from crashing while trying to load too many things at once.<a id="id663" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Remove objects from the display hierarchy:</strong> When a display object is created, it is implicitly added to a display hierarchy. When you no longer need a display object, you should remove it from the display hierarchy, especially when the objects contain images. This can be done by using <code class="literal">display.remove( myImage ); myImage = nil</code>.<a id="id664" class="indexterm"/><p>For example:
</p><div><pre class="programlisting">local box = display.newRect( 0, 50, 100, 100)
box:setFillColor( 255, 255, 255, 255 )
box.alpha = 1
local function removeBox()
if box.alpha == 1 then
print("box removed")
display.remove( box )
box = nil
end
end
timer.performWithDelay( 1000, removeBox, 1 ) -- Runs timer to 1000 milliseconds before calling the block within removeBox()
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Sound files should be made as small as possible: use a free program like Audacity or your preferred audio software to compress music or sound effects and build for the device. It is best to compare untouched audio with compressed audio to hear the difference in quality. This will help you determine a good median between sound quality and file size.<a id="id665" class="indexterm"/></li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec01"/>Graphics</h2></div></div></div><p>Display images have a way of taking up a lot of texture memory if you're not paying attention to the size and amount of images being used all at once.<a id="id666" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec01"/>Group objects</h3></div></div></div><p>If a property of several objects is set to the same value, it's preferable to add the objects to a group and then modify the property of the group. It'll make it much easier for you to code and it optimizes your animation.<a id="id667" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec02"/>Turn off animations when they're not being used</h3></div></div></div><p>It's easy to forget to stop animations from running in the background when they're not needed or when you simply have them invisible.<a id="id668" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>When you include a listener such as<code class="literal">"enterFrame"</code> and the objects registered under the listener have been set to <code class="literal">.isVisible = false</code>, it'll continue to run in the background even though it is not seen onscreen. Make sure that listeners are removed when they are not needed.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl3sec03"/>Optimizing image sizes</h3></div></div></div><p>When you have large file sizes, especially full-screen images, the responsiveness of your application will slow down because of the time it takes to load and plus it uses up a lot of memory. When using large images, try compressing the file size as much as you can with an image-editing tool such as Photoshop or Pngcrush for example. It'll help reduce the file size and save you the pain on application lag. Compressing large image sizes will benefit you in the long run.<a id="id669" class="indexterm"/>

</p><p>In order to distribute for the App Store, you need to create an App Store Distribution Provisioning Profile. Any other profile, whether development or ad-hoc will not be accepted.

The Android system uses the certificate as a means of identifying the author of an application and establishing a relationship of trust between applications. The certificate is not used to control which applications the user can install. The certificate does not need to be signed by a certificate authority; it can be self-signed. Certificates can be signed on either Mac or Windows systems.<a id="id705" class="indexterm"/>
