transition.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"10666\">Introducing zoom transition</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"10694\">This is a small improvement, but it may</st> <st c=\"10734\">indicate an interesting direction Apple is taking with SwiftUI.</st> <st c=\"10799\">In general, UIKit’s transitioning capabilities are very robust and provide us with the flexibility to create any transition we want.</st> <st c=\"10932\">Even before that, from the beginning, UIKit had some nice built-in transitions we could use to make our navigation</st> <st c=\"11047\">more appealing.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"11062\">In iOS 18, Apple added a new transition that allows us to navigate to a new view using a</st> <st c=\"11152\">zoom animation.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"11167\">Let’s create an album grid that, when tapping on the album, transitions to a full album screen with a</st> <st c=\"11270\">zoom animation:</st>\n\n```", "```swift\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"11794\">This example shows a simple grid view</st> <st c=\"11832\">of albums, a NavigationStack, and a NavigationLink.</st> <st c=\"11885\">The idea of performing the zoom transition is to match the source (the image we tapped on) to the destination (the image we</st> <st c=\"12009\">zoomed into).</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"12022\">We do that by adding two</st> <st c=\"12048\">view modifiers:</st>\n\n\t\t\t\t*   `<st c=\"12063\">navigationTransition</st>`<st c=\"12084\">: We add this modifier to the source view.</st> <st c=\"12128\">The source view, in our case, is the album view in the grid.</st> <st c=\"12189\">We select the type of animation (currently, it’s a zoom animation) and the</st> <st c=\"12264\">source ID.</st>\n\t\t\t\t*   `<st c=\"12274\">matchedTransitionSource</st>`<st c=\"12298\">: We add this modifier to the destination view.</st> <st c=\"12347\">In our example, the destination view is the full-screen view of the album.</st> <st c=\"12422\">Again, we provide the ID of the album we want to present so SwiftUI can perform the zoom animation between</st> <st c=\"12529\">these views.</st>\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"12541\">Creating the match between the views allows SwiftUI to perform a nice zoom animation, similar to what we see in the Photos app.</st> <st c=\"12670\">Look at</st> *<st c=\"12678\">Figure 1</st>**<st c=\"12686\">.1</st>*<st c=\"12688\">:</st>\n\t\t\t![Figure 1.1: Zoom transition between photos grid and a full-screen

serve</st> <st c=\"12890\">more than aesthetic purposes.</st> <st c=\"12921\">They inform the user about the changes occurring on the screen, helping them</st> <st c=\"12998\">stay oriented.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"13012\">To read more about navigation in iOS, read</st> [*<st c=\"13056\">Chapter 4</st>*](B21795_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor148)<st c=\"13065\">.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"13066\">Speaking of navigation, iPadOS navigation gained a unique and valuable capability – the</st> <st c=\"13155\">floating bar.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"13168\">Adding a floating tab bar</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"13194\">iPad is not the focus</st> <st c=\"13216\">of this book.</st> <st c=\"13231\">This is not because iPadOS is unimportant but because most, if not all, of the topics we discuss here are also suitable</st> <st c=\"13351\">for iPadOS.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"13362\">However, there are special features that are relevant to iPadOS that are worth mentioning.</st> <st c=\"13454\">One of them is the float</st> <st c=\"13479\">tab bar.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"13487\">The tab bar has existed in iOS since its very beginning.</st> <st c=\"13545\">It allows users to navigate between different sections of an app.</st> <st c=\"13611\">In both iOS and iPadOS, the tab is located at the bottom of the screen.</st> <st c=\"13683\">While it looks perfectly fine on small devices, a tab bar on big screens seems stretched and doesn’t use the</st> <st c=\"13792\">large space.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"13804\">One solution for handling navigation in a iPadOS is to implement a sidebar – a view on the side that displays the different sections of</st> <st c=\"13941\">the app.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"13949\">In iPadOS 18, the position</st> <st c=\"13976\">of the sidebar changed, and it is now located at the top of the screen, floating over the app content.</st> <st c=\"14080\">Not only that; the user can also transition between a tab bar and a sidebar.</st> <st c=\"14157\">Let’s see how to do that</st> <st c=\"14182\">in code:</st>\n\n```", "```swift\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"14438\">This code example looks straightforward but includes a view modifier called</st> `<st c=\"14515\">tabViewStyle</st>`<st c=\"14527\">. Currently, it has only one option to choose from –</st> `<st c=\"14580\">sidebarAdaptable</st>`<st c=\"14596\">. When we add this view modifier, a button is added to the tab bar that allows the user to change the layout.</st> <st c=\"14706\">Let’s see how it looks (</st>*<st c=\"14730\">Figure 1</st>**<st c=\"14739\">.2</st>*<st c=\"14741\">):</st>\n\t\t\t![Figure 1.2: The Tab bar adapts a sidebar layout](img/B21795_01_02.jpg)\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"14831\">Figure 1.2: The Tab bar adapts a sidebar layout</st>\n\t\t\t*<st c=\"14878\">Figure 1</st>**<st c=\"14887\">.2</st>* <st c=\"14889\">shows the two layouts</st> <st c=\"14911\">for our tab bar.</st> <st c=\"14929\">The new sidebar improves the user experience and makes navigating and focusing on content easier.</st> <st c=\"15027\">It also resembles Apple’s apps, such as the TV app, which aligns with what users can expect from</st> <st c=\"15124\">our app.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"15132\">Another important aspect of SwiftUI that required improvement is scroll views.</st> <st c=\"15212\">Let’s go over major changes in</st> <st c=\"15243\">that area.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"15253\">Having more control over scroll views</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"15291\">Controlling and observing scroll view behavior</st> <st c=\"15338\">was part of the reason why UIKit developers ha</st><st c=\"15385\">dn’t moved to</st> <st c=\"15400\">SwiftUI yet.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"15412\">Scroll views are crucial in mobile apps, not just because of the small screen, which often requires the user to scroll for more content, but also because they help reuse visible content to minimize memory usage or adjust our UI based on</st> <st c=\"15650\">scroll position.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"15666\">However, why is handling scroll views in SwiftUI</st> <st c=\"15716\">more complex than in UIKit?</st> <st c=\"15744\">We can think of</st> <st c=\"15760\">two reasons:</st>\n\n\t\t\t\t1.  **<st c=\"15772\">SwiftUI is relatively new</st>**<st c=\"15798\">: SwiftUI is still considered to be a new framework.</st> <st c=\"15852\">Think how much time it took for UIKit to become a mature framework.</st> <st c=\"15920\">Obviously, we can achieve this in several years and 17 years</st> <st c=\"15981\">of development.</st>\n\t\t\t\t2.  `<st c=\"16336\">@State</st>` <st c=\"16342\">variable or a</st> <st c=\"16357\">view modifier.</st>\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"16371\">These reasons lead to many workarounds that developers use to achieve the desired user experience.</st> <st c=\"16471\">Fortunately, iOS 18 gives us two view modifiers that make SwiftUI scroll views more appealing than ever.</st> <st c=\"16576\">We’ll start</st> <st c=\"16588\">with</st> `<st c=\"16593\">onScrollGeometryChange</st>`<st c=\"16615\">.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"16616\">Observing the scroll view position</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"16651\">Up until now, SwiftUI hasn’t provided</st> <st c=\"16689\">any direct API to observe the scroll view position.</st> <st c=\"16742\">Many developers had to find a workaround or use UIKit as a solution.</st> <st c=\"16811\">Now, we have an</st> `<st c=\"16827\">onScrollGeometryChange</st>` <st c=\"16849\">view modifier that allows us to observe any change in the</st> <st c=\"16908\">scroll position.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"16924\">Let’s say we have a</st> `<st c=\"16945\">VStack</st>` <st c=\"16951\">view within a scroll view, and we wish to show a</st> **<st c=\"17001\">Scroll to the top</st>** <st c=\"17018\">button whenever the user scrolls down to allow them to return to the top of</st> <st c=\"17095\">the list.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"17104\">Let’s look at the</st> <st c=\"17123\">following code:</st>\n\n```", "```swift\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"17658\">In this code example, we can see a</st> `<st c=\"17693\">VStack</st>` <st c=\"17699\">view inside a scroll view.</st> <st c=\"17727\">The</st> `<st c=\"17731\">VStack</st>` <st c=\"17737\">view contains a list of albums.</st> <st c=\"17770\">Notice that we have an</st> `<st c=\"17793\">onScrollGeometryChange</st>` <st c=\"17815\">view modifier for the scroll view itself.</st> <st c=\"17858\">The view modifier has a closure that runs each time the scroll position changes with a</st> `<st c=\"17945\">geometry</st>` <st c=\"17953\">parameter.</st> <st c=\"17965\">Within the closure, we inspect the scroll view content offset, and if it reaches a specific threshold, we show/hide the</st> **<st c=\"18085\">Scroll to top</st>** <st c=\"18098\">button using a specific</st> <st c=\"18123\">state variable.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"18138\">The</st> `<st c=\"18143\">ScrollViewReader</st>` <st c=\"18159\">view, which wraps</st> <st c=\"18177\">the scroll view, provides a proxy to the scroll view so we can scroll to the top when the user presses</st> <st c=\"18281\">the button.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"18292\">We can use the</st> `<st c=\"18308\">onScrollGeometryChange</st>` <st c=\"18330\">method for more use cases than just toggling a button.</st> <st c=\"18386\">For example, we can use it to perform a network request in an infinity list where we need to load more content from the server when the user reaches the bottom.</st> <st c=\"18547\">Additional examples would be having a sticky header or a progress indicator, or even just sending analytics.</st> <st c=\"18656\">These use cases were complex to implement before iOS 18 and are now</st> <st c=\"18724\">extremely simple.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"18741\">The improvement in the second scroll view seems to belong to the same family.</st> <st c=\"18820\">Let’s review</st> <st c=\"18833\">it now.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"18840\">Observing items’ visibility</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"18868\">Checking whether a view is visible</st> <st c=\"18903\">inside a scroll view is not easy.</st> <st c=\"18938\">Up until now, we had to calculate the view frame versus the scroll view content offset, not to mention observe that during a scroll view.</st> <st c=\"19076\">Lucky for us, we now have a new modifier</st> <st c=\"19117\">called</st> `<st c=\"19124\">onScrollVisibilityChange</st>`<st c=\"19148\">.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"19149\">Suppose we want to change a view while it enters our scroll view.</st> <st c=\"19216\">For example, we might want to report analytics or print to</st> <st c=\"19275\">the console.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"19287\">Let’s look at the</st> <st c=\"19306\">following example:</st>\n\n```", "```swift\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"19500\">This code example shows the same album row we created in the previous example (in the</st> *<st c=\"19586\">Observing the scroll view position</st>* <st c=\"19620\">section).</st> <st c=\"19631\">This time, we added a new view modifier to the view itself –</st> `<st c=\"19692\">onScrollVisibilityChange</st>`<st c=\"19716\">. This view modifier has two parameters –</st> `<st c=\"19758\">threshold</st>` <st c=\"19767\">and</st> `<st c=\"19772\">closure</st>` <st c=\"19779\">with a</st> `<st c=\"19787\">Bool</st>` <st c=\"19791\">parameter (named</st> `<st c=\"19809\">visible</st>` <st c=\"19816\">in our case).</st> <st c=\"19831\">Let’s review</st> <st c=\"19844\">them now:</st>\n\n\t\t\t\t*   `<st c=\"19853\">threshold</st>`<st c=\"19863\">: The</st> `<st c=\"19870\">threshold</st>` <st c=\"19879\">parameter defines how much the change must occur for the closure to run.</st> <st c=\"19953\">For example, a threshold of 0.2 means that we need 20% of the view to be visible or hidden before it runs the closure and reports</st> <st c=\"20083\">the change.</st>\n\t\t\t\t*   `<st c=\"20094\">closure</st>`<st c=\"20102\">: The closure with the</st> `<st c=\"20126\">Bool</st>` <st c=\"20130\">parameter runs each time the view reaches the threshold.</st> <st c=\"20188\">The</st> `<st c=\"20192\">Bool</st>` <st c=\"20196\">parameter contains the change –</st> `<st c=\"20229\">true</st>` <st c=\"20233\">for visible and</st> `<st c=\"20250\">false</st>` <st c=\"20255\">for hidden.</st>\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"20267\">In our code example, we set the threshold to</st> `<st c=\"20313\">0.9</st>`<st c=\"20316\">. This means that we need to view it to reveal 90% of its size before the closure runs.</st> <st c=\"20404\">Inside the closure, we check whether the view is visible before we report it to</st> <st c=\"20484\">the console.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"20496\">We can use this view modifier for many purposes.</st> <st c=\"20546\">For example, we can perform a specific animation when the view enters, load additional information, or adjust the screen interface if needed.</st> <st c=\"20688\">Something that was complex to do before is now simple to accomplish</st> <st c=\"20755\">using one</st> <st c=\"20766\">view modifier.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"20780\">Scroll view is not the only topic we have more control of.</st> <st c=\"20840\">Let’s talk</st> <st c=\"20851\">about texts.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"20863\">Changing the text rendering behavior</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"20900\">Handling texts on screen</st> <st c=\"20925\">was also a very mature area where UIKit provided great frameworks such as TextKit.</st> <st c=\"21009\">We could manipulate texts and create almost any effect that</st> <st c=\"21069\">we wanted.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"21079\">In iOS 18, Apple introduced TextRenderer, a protocol that can help us change the default behavior of our texts</st> <st c=\"21191\">in SwiftUI.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"21202\">Let’s say that we want a title with a different opacity for each line and even rotate the lines a bit.</st> <st c=\"21306\">This creates a nice effect for the titles in our app.</st> <st c=\"21360\">So, let’s see how to do that</st> <st c=\"21389\">in SwiftUI:</st>\n\n```", "```swift\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"21823\">This code example has a new structure called</st> `<st c=\"21869\">CustomTextRender</st>`<st c=\"21885\">, which conforms to the</st> `<st c=\"21909\">TextRenderer</st>` <st c=\"21921\">protocol.</st> <st c=\"21932\">We have one important function to implement – the</st> `<st c=\"21982\">draw()</st>` <st c=\"21988\">function.</st> <st c=\"21999\">In this function, we receive an important parameter –</st> `<st c=\"22053\">ctx</st>` <st c=\"22056\">– the graphic context.</st> <st c=\"22080\">The</st> `<st c=\"22084\">TextRenderer</st>` <st c=\"22096\">protocol also provides us access to the different lines and slices we have in our text.</st> <st c=\"22185\">In our example, we can iterate the different

to text can give a dynamic visualization</st> <st c=\"22659\">for titles and paragraphs and add more life to</st> <st c=\"22707\">our apps.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"22716\">Next, let’s see how SwiftUI has become more mature and capable than ever with positioning sub -iews from</st> <st c=\"22822\">other views.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"22834\">Positioning sub-views from another view</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"22874\">What does it mean to position</st> <st c=\"22904\">sub-views from another view?</st> <st c=\"22934\">While this description sounds weird and unclear, it is a nice addition to SwiftUI that can help us provide more dynamic and</st> <st c=\"23058\">reusable content.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"23075\">To understand what it means, let’s take the following code as</st> <st c=\"23138\">an example:</st>\n\n```", "```swift\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"23682\">This code example shows a view called</st> `<st c=\"23721\">NewsView</st>` <st c=\"23729\">with a list of</st> `<st c=\"23745\">Text</st>` <st c=\"23750\">components, each containing a news headline.</st> <st c=\"23795\">If we look closely, we can see that there’s no layout – no VStack, group, or List.</st> <st c=\"23878\">We are not used to this in SwiftUI, and that’s okay because that view is</st> <st c=\"23951\">for display.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"23963\">The</st> `<st c=\"23968\">NewsView</st>` <st c=\"23976\">job is to be a container</st> <st c=\"24001\">for components.</st> <st c=\"24018\">Let’s see how we can use</st> <st c=\"24043\">this container:</st>\n\n```", "```swift\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"24399\">In this example, we added a SwiftUI group, but this time, from the</st> `<st c=\"24467\">NewsView</st>` <st c=\"24475\">view:</st>\n\n```", "```swift\n\n\t\t\t<st c=\"24525\">This line creates a group that iterates over the specific view’s sub-views and allows us to position and modify</st> <st c=\"24638\">them ourselves.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"24653\">In our example, we change the font of the first sub-view and present all the views with a spacer</st> <st c=\"24751\">between them.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"24764\">The ability to reposition views</st> <st c=\"24796\">within other views unlocks new possibilities.</st> <st c=\"24843\">For instance, we can reuse the same views but with different layouts, sequences, or styles.</st> <st c=\"24935\">Treating our views as containers for smaller components makes our code</st> <st c=\"25006\">more reusable.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"25020\">Now, let’s move to our chapter’s last section – the</st> <st c=\"25073\">AI revolution.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"25087\">Entering the AI revolution</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"25114\">AI and machine learning</st> <st c=\"25139\">are not new areas for Apple and the iOS platform.</st> <st c=\"25189\">Apple uses AI to adjust photos taken, suggest apps to users according to their usage, optimize battery charging, and</st> <st c=\"25306\">many more.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"25316\">For developers, Apple provides the CoreML framework and tools such as Create ML to help users train and create their own machine</st> <st c=\"25446\">learning models.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"25462\">However, the rising popularity of services such as ChatGPT and Gemini proved that CoreML is insufficient, and that Apple needs to integrate AI deeper into</st> <st c=\"25618\">the system.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"25629\">So, what did Apple prepare for us, the developers, regarding AI in</st> <st c=\"25697\">iOS 18?</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"25704\">Apple integrated AI into iOS 18 by letting iOS understand what’s happening in the system and helping the user perform common tasks using natural language understanding, similar</st> <st c=\"25882\">to ChatGPT.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"25893\">For example, let’s say we’re working on a word-processing app and created an App Intent that allows the user to add an image to</st> <st c=\"26022\">a document.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"26033\">Until iOS 18, we would have had to define a specific phrase for the user to use with Siri.</st> <st c=\"26125\">However, in iOS 18, the user can say something such as “Add this image to the page I’m working on,” and Siri uses a set of machine-learning models to convert this phrase to our app intent model.</st> <st c=\"26320\">Not only that, but Siri can also understand the current context on screen and even search our app by indexing our app content in</st> <st c=\"26449\">the spotlight.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"26463\">Integrating our app into Siri requires</st> <st c=\"26502\">little effort.</st> <st c=\"26518\">We mainly need to focus on structuring our main actions and entities.</st> <st c=\"26588\">Apple Intelligence does all</st> <st c=\"26616\">the rest.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"26625\">To read more about using App Intents with Siri, go to</st> [*<st c=\"26680\">Chapter 13</st>*](B21795_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor401)<st c=\"26690\">.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"26691\">Summary</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"26699\">There’s no other way of looking at iOS 18 than as an exciting one.</st> <st c=\"26767\">The addition of Apple Intelligence is only part of the story – Apple took care of many system and SDK aspects such as testing, persistent data, UI,</st> <st c=\"26915\">and more.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"26924\">In this chapter, we explored the basics of the new Swift Testing framework, learned about Swift Data improvements, and discussed enhancements in SwiftUI such as zoom transition, floating tab bar, scroll views, and text rendering.</st> <st c=\"27155\">We even scratched the surface of Apple Intelligence and tried to understand how it is integrated with App Intents.</st> <st c=\"27270\">By now, you should be familiar with the most exciting and new topics in</st> <st c=\"27342\">iOS 18.</st>\n\t\t\t<st c=\"27349\">A few code examples are just not enough.</st> <st c=\"27391\">We are developers, and we need more!</st> <st c=\"27428\">So, let’s jump straight into SwiftData and explore Apple’s new persistent data framework in the</st> <st c=\"27524\">next chapter.</st>\n\n```"]
