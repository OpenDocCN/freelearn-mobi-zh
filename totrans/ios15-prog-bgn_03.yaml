    you can type in Swift code and have the results displayed immediately. Next, you'll
    study how Swift represents and stores various types of data. After that, you'll
    look at some cool Swift features such as **type inference** and **type safety**,
    which help you to write code more concisely and avoid common errors. Finally,
    you'll learn how to perform common operations on data and how to print messages
    to the Debug area to help you troubleshoot issues.

    constant contains `3.5`, a value of type `Double`. Putting `rating` in between

    variable, returning the string `"The restaurant rating is 3.5``"`.
