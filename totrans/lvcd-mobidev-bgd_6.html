</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>To-do lists, alarms, birthday reminders, notes, shopping lists, and the list goes on. There should be an app to keep a list of the different apps that keep lists! At the time of writing this book, there were already over 8,000 iOS apps that were lists, planners, or alarms. Perhaps, there's room for one more…</em></span>
</p><p>It could take a lot of research, and money, to explore all the reminder apps that are out there. The majority of apps will have a lot of features that you'll never use and at least one vital feature that is missing. If you're lucky, some combination of apps may do all the things you want in a reminder. However, don't forget that you use LiveCode and can make your own reminder app!</p><p>In this chapter, we will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Discuss what is meant by a <span class="emphasis"><em>reminder</em></span></li><li class="listitem">Create some time measuring utility functions</li><li class="listitem">Define a data structure to store information about an event</li><li class="listitem">Make use of mobile device "notifications"</li><li class="listitem">Create a flexible reminder app</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Different types of reminders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec74"/>Different types of reminders</h1></div></div></div><p>Here is the <a id="id415" class="indexterm"/>list of a few of the things that you might call a "reminder":</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">A shopping list</li><li class="listitem">A Christmas present list</li><li class="listitem">A to-do list</li><li class="listitem">An alarm clock</li><li class="listitem">An egg timer</li><li class="listitem">A birthday reminder</li></ul></div><p>Now, is there a single way to describe all of these things? Well, it may get wordy, but a reminder could be described as a notification message or sound that either appears automatically or shows when you look for it. It is used to let you know that a certain time has passed, a moment has arrived, or that an outstanding task has not been completed.</p><p>See, pretty wordy. Breaking <a id="id416" class="indexterm"/>it down like this helps us to see what features a reminder app will need to have. Before getting to that, let's test the definition against the preceding examples:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>A shopping list</strong></span>: In this <a id="id417" class="indexterm"/>case, you go looking for the reminder. Although, we could set it up to automatically show when your location happens to be near the store! Other than that, this is effectively a task that has not been completed.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>A Christmas present list</strong></span>: This <a id="id418" class="indexterm"/>is much the same as a shopping list, but it could use a timed message that let's you know how few shopping days are left for you to buy a Christmas present for your loved ones.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>A to-do list</strong></span>: Again, this <a id="id419" class="indexterm"/>is simply a list of tasks that are not yet complete.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>An alarm clock</strong></span>: This gives <a id="id420" class="indexterm"/>you a notification that a moment in time has been reached.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>An egg timer</strong></span>: This is a notification <a id="id421" class="indexterm"/>of a certain amount of time that has passed, which could be used as a sequence of such events that might be used in a cooking-buddy app.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>A birthday reminder</strong></span>: This shows <a id="id422" class="indexterm"/>whether a certain moment has been reached. Really though, you want to set the reminder so that it can notify you ahead of the actual event.</p><p>At least as a starting point, we can use the definition to guide us as we outline the abilities the app will need to have.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Timing of notifications" id="aid-2D7TI1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec75"/>Timing of notifications</h1></div></div></div><p>The mobile notifications that <a id="id423" class="indexterm"/>can be created with LiveCode will be sent the moment you ask for it to be sent. Strangely though, the value is based on the number of seconds since midnight on January 1st, 1970, specifically, in part of London! Well, it's named after an area of London called Greenwich.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Greenwich Mean Time</strong></span>, often referred to as <span class="strong"><strong>GMT</strong></span>, has been used as the standard for measuring time. It is somewhat superseded by <span class="strong"><strong>UTC</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Coordinated Universal Time</strong></span>), but in either case, it represents the exact current time at least for <a id="id424" class="indexterm"/>countries that are within the same time zone as Greenwich. The rest of us add or subtract some amount of time from that value.</p><p>In order to adapt to the fact that the Earth doesn't go around the Sun in an exact number of days or even an exact number of quarter days, calendars are adjusted by one day every four years, though not on 100 year boundaries, except for every 400 years (for example, the year 2000 was a leap year). These adjustments are still not enough to keep the clocks on time! The <a id="id425" class="indexterm"/>clocks are out of time by about 0.6 seconds a year, and so there are "Leap Seconds" added to compensate for that. In theory, Leap Seconds could be used to subtract one second, but as of yet, this hasn't been needed, as they have only been used to add one second.</p><p>None of this affects the number of seconds since midnight of January 1, 1970, but it does mean that converting LiveCode's <span class="strong"><strong>seconds</strong></span> into time and date using your own arithmetic won't give you the right time. Yet, it's still used as the basis for notifications. This value is usually referred to as <a id="id426" class="indexterm"/>Unix Time.</p><p>It doesn't matter much though if you end up sending someone a Happy Birthday message 25 seconds early! Don't worry, the way we'll calculate the notification time will take care of the oddity.</p><div class="section" title="Date and time pickers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec114"/>Date and time pickers</h2></div></div></div><p>As mentioned in the preceding section, mobile notifications use the number of seconds since midnight of January 1, 1970 and don't add on the 25 seconds, or Leap Seconds, that have occurred since then. When we present the date and time pickers to the user, the selections the user makes will come back as the actual current or future time. We will adjust for that later.</p></div></div>

<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h2></div></div></div><p>We just made two simple scripts that call the native date or time picker and convert the result into seconds to then show them in a field. What is interesting to note is that for the Pick Time case, it doesn't return the number of seconds of the current day, that is, all the seconds since midnight of January 1, 1970. In order to set a notification time for a particular time of a particular date, we have to do a little arithmetic. We'll go into that a little later when we make the actual reminder app in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Making the reminders app</em></span> section of this chapter.</p></div><div class="section" title="Pop quiz – OA (odd acronyms!)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec116"/>Pop quiz – OA (odd acronyms!)</h2></div></div></div><p>You may have <a id="id433" class="indexterm"/>noticed that the acronym for "Coordinated Universal Time" is UTC and not CUT.

<div class="section" title="Where?" id="aid-2F4UM1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec77"/>Where?</h1></div></div></div><p>There is something we can do in a mobile reminder app that would never work in a pen and paper version of a reminder; we can present the list of reminders based on where you are at the time that you check it! To make use of location, you need to know where you are now and how far your location is from the place associated with the reminder.</p><p>At the time of writing this book, there was no ability in LiveCode to directly pull in a map so that you could choose locations other than the one you are at right now. So, we'll work within that limitation.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note14"/>Note</h3><p>That being <a id="id434" class="indexterm"/>said, there is <code class="literal">mergMK</code> external (for more information, refer to <a class="ulink" href="http://mergext.com">http://mergext.com</a>), which works with iOS versions before 7.0 and was being updated at the time of writing this book. You could also use a combination of HTML and JavaScript as described in the article at <a class="ulink" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25629786/fetch-data-from-html-file-in-livecode">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25629786/fetch-data-from-html-file-in-livecode</a>. However, these are both beyond the scope of this beginner's book</p></div><p>The general technique while reading a mobile device's sensors, is to start tracking a given sensor, detect when changes happen, and to stop tracking the sensor. You can take a reading from the sensor at <a id="id435" class="indexterm"/>any time between the start and stop tracking commands. You can also specify how detailed a report you want and whether you want a precise reading. The precise reading of the location would dictate whether GPS was used or not. The advantage of using GPS is that you get greater accuracy (assuming there's a clear signal at the time) and the disadvantages are that it uses more battery power, and devices that don't <a id="id436" class="indexterm"/>have GPS cannot use this feature. When using location as part of a reminder, we're mainly interested in whether you're at home, the office, or perhaps at the supermarket. So, we'll use the less precise reading, the GPS one would be an overkill.</p></div>

Let's say you really use this app a lot and have dozens of reminders. The reminder you created about buying some bread may be at the bottom of the list, but if you have assigned the location of the supermarket to that reminder, sorting the list while you're outside the supermarket should bring the shopping list items to the top.</p><p>When faced <a id="id442" class="indexterm"/>with a problem such as this one, how will you come to know the distance between two points on Earth; Google is a good starting place for you to find that out!

<div class="section" title="Information needed in a reminder" id="aid-2H1VQ1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec79"/>Information needed in a reminder</h1></div></div></div><p>We're well on the <a id="id445" class="indexterm"/>way to know how to set a time and date for the reminder notification to occur, and we will be able to sort the reminders based on the distance from where we are. However, what exact information do we need in the reminder itself?</p><p>If this were a birthday reminder app, you would just need to ask for the person's name and the date of their birthday. If it were a shopping list app, you would need the name of the item and maybe the quantity. For a timer, you would need to ask what the event is called and would need to set a time for the event.</p><p>Here though, we're trying to make a completely flexible reminder app; it would be up to the user to describe the item in whatever manner they wish. So, we'll just ask for a title and a brief description. We will also need to offer the option of setting a date, time, an associated location, and whether an alert sound should be played.</p><p>Another thing to think about is; where will we store the information for the list of reminders? While making the WebScraper app in <a class="link" title="Chapter 4. Using Remote Data and Media" href="part0056.xhtml#aid-1LCVG2">Chapter 4,</a> <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Remote Data and Media</em></span>, we chose to duplicate the main application stack into the documents folder and to then jump into that copy of the stack. This enabled the ability to save changes to the stack. The reminder app is a simpler case; we're only trying to store a few text strings to define each reminder and it would be simpler to just write a text file using this app.</p><p>We want to allow the <a id="id446" class="indexterm"/>user to make a list of locations, so that a reminder can be associated with that location. Rather than writing a different text file, we will make the first piece of information in each entry be the function of that entry. Right now, the only two functions are <code class="literal">location</code> and <code class="literal">reminder</code>. The following is an example of how the text file might look:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Location  Home  40.692636  -73.978376

Reminder  Boss  Buy lunch	1334592000  Office  true</pre></div><p>Between each item in the line is a tab character, which will be used to separate the parts of the entry. The structure for a location is:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Function: <code class="literal">Location</code></li><li class="listitem">Location's title</li><li class="listitem">Latitude</li><li class="listitem">Longitude</li></ul></div><p>For a reminder, it's:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Function: <code class="literal">Reminder</code></li><li class="listitem">Title</li><li class="listitem">Brief description</li><li class="listitem">Notification time in seconds since midnight of January 1, 1970</li><li class="listitem">A location associated with this reminder</li><li class="listitem">Whether to play an alert sound (<code class="literal">true</code> or <code class="literal">false</code>)</li></ol><div style="height:10px; width: 1px"/></div></div>

Unfortunately, we are entering text into fields that are able to take a return character. To solve the issue, we set the Return button to say <span class="emphasis"><em>Done</em></span>, which will lead the user to expect the keyboard to go away when that button is pressed.

However, there is one bit of cute arithmetic going on in there too. At the start of this chapter, we looked at how Unix Time differs from the actual time at a rate of 0.6 seconds per year. If you want to set a notification at 8 AM five years from now, you can't take the value that the Set Time button gave you because that refers to today's 8 AM. You can't take the value that Set <a id="id487" class="indexterm"/>Date gave you because that would be midnight. So, by converting the time value to the short date format and then back to the seconds format, you can find out what the Unix Time was at midnight of the current day. Subtracting that from the value that Set Time gave you let's you know the number of seconds since midnight, regardless of how many seconds behind Unix Time is. Adding that value to the one from Set Date will give us an exact Unix Time in seconds for the notification to occur. Under iOS, there is a picker type that allows you to set the date and time together, but as that isn't on Android, we've used a way that works for both.</p></div></li></ol><div style="height:10px; width: 1px"/></div><div class="section" title="What just happened?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec129"/>

Honestly, you could bet a fortune that it won't work the first time, but if it works well enough to show the raw text in the data field on the first card, hopefully, you'll be able to track down any errors in the code. You can also type in some test data into the stack on your computer and at least test the functions that don't require device-specific features.</p></div><div class="section" title="Have a go hero – nice transitions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec130"/>Have a go hero – nice transitions</h2></div></div></div><p>Really, if you've <a id="id488" class="indexterm"/>managed to get through and entered all that code to the point that the app is working, you're already a hero! However, read the section in the iOS and Android release notes for LiveCode about <span class="emphasis"><em>Visual effects support</em></span>. Check whether you can get some typical mobile OS transitions happening as you go to and from the different cards.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary" id="aid-2NNJO1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec86"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>This chapter was way more exciting than expected! A reminder app is absolutely not quite as impressive as Angry Birds, but making use of the location features of a mobile device makes it a little more novel. Along the way, we covered the process of reading and writing data to the special documents folder as well as the use of pickers for straightforward lists, dates, and time. We also showed how to read the current location of the device and how to set up local notification events.</p><p>In the best of cases, you can manage to make a mobile app in a few hours or a few days, but there is quite a lot that goes on before you can submit the app to the various app stores. Sounds like a good topic for the next chapter!</p></div></body></html>
