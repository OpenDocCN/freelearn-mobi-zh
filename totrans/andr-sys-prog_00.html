<p>Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the world. Since 2013, Android has around 80% market share worldwide, while the second largest mobile operating system, iOS, has less than 20% market share. Due to the popularity of Android, there are many books about Android programming in the market. Most of them are targeted at Android application developers, which are the largest community in the world of Android development.</p>
<p>There is also another group of people working on the layer beneath the Android framework. Many people call them Android system developers. Comparing to Android application developers, Android system developers use the C/C++ languages, or even assembly language, to develop system services or device drivers. The scope and the definition of Android system development is much more vague than comparing to Android application development. For Android application development, the development environment and tools are very clear: the Android SDK and Android Studio from Google should be used and the programming language is Java.</p>
<p>For Android system development, we may use the Android NDK to develop Android system services or native applications. Many people refer to development based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) as Android system development. Nevertheless, Android system development encompasses the activities that produces native applications, services, or device drivers for a particular hardware platform. It closer to the hardware and the operating system, whereas Android application development is more general and hardware-independent.</p>
<p>Due to the hardware and operating system dependencies, it is more difficult to teach Android system programming than Android application programming. From the number of books in the market, we can see this. It is much easier to teach Android application development using specific examples. The readers of application programming books can follow the examples and can test them on most available Android devices. However, most Android system programming book can only talk about general concepts or ideas. When the authors want to use examples, they must pertain to a particular hardware platform and Android version. This makes it difficult for readers to repeat the same process.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Virtual hardware platforms</h1>
            

            
                
<p>To make the discussion more general and overcome the issue of specific hardware platforms, I use virtual hardware platforms to demonstrate the work at the Android system level.</p>
<p>Before this book, I made an attempt to use a virtual hardware platform to explain how we can learn embedded system programming using an Android emulator in my previous book, <em>Embedded Programming with Android</em>. It seems many readers liked the idea, because they can explore the code examples much more easily on a virtual hardware platform that is available for everyone.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Android version used in this book</h1>
            

            
                
<p>Android is still changing at a very fast pace. When I completed the book <em>Embedded Programming with Android</em>, we were still using Android 5 (Lollipop), and Android 6 (Marshmallow) was on the way to market with preview releases. Now while I am working on this book, Android 7 devices are available on the market and the next release of Android 8 has been announced with preview releases. We will use Android 7 (Nougat) to build all source code used in this book.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">What this book covers</h1>
            

            
                
<p>In this book, we discuss the Android system programming practices. We will use two projects (x86emu and x86vbox) to teach essential knowledge of Android system programming. The book is split into includes two parts.</p>
<p>The first part of this book talks about how to customize, extend, and port an Android system. We will use an Android emulator as the virtual hardware platform to demonstrate how to customize and extend an Android system. You will learn how to integrate an ARM translator (Houdini) into the Intel x86-based emulator and how to add Wi-Fi support to an Android emulator. We will use an x86emu device to learn these topics. After that, we will learn how to port an Android system to a new platform using VirtualBox. You will learn how to boot Android in the PXE/NFS environment, how to enable the graphics system, and how to integrate VirtualBox Guest Additions into the Android system. We will use x86vbox device to learn these topics.</p>
<p>In the second part of this book, we will learn how to update or patch a released system using recovery. In this part, we will provide a general introduction to recovery first. After that, we will explore how to build recovery for x86vbox device. With recovery for x86vbox device, we will demonstrate how to flash an update package to change the system image. We will use examples such as the Gapps and xposed recovery packages to demonstrate how to update an Android system image using third-party recovery packages.</p>
<p><a href="4ddc5eff-b4d7-452c-b83c-0c3c1d40da57.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introduction to Android System Programming</em>, covers a general introduction of Android system programming. It also explains the scope of this book.</p>
<p><a href="984e0cef-7bf6-4454-bede-bb34c553be12.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Setting Up the Development Environment</em>, provides details of the development environment setup for AOSP programming. After we set up the development environment, we will build an Android emulator image to test our setup. Other than the environment setup, we specifically discuss how to create your own source code mirror of AOSP from GitHub to help your quickly switch between different configurations.</p>
<p><a href="e0f861c2-5832-402f-89d3-cfc75785e759.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Discovering Kernel, HAL, and Virtual Hardware</em>, covers an introduction to the Linux kernel, Hardware Abstraction Layer, and virtual hardware. In this chapter, we look at all the layers in the Android system software stack related to porting. We also take a in-depth look at the internals of the virtual hardware that we are going to use in this book.</p>
<p><a href="f69f330a-932c-4a32-bb78-e427c860b65e.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Customizing the Android Emulator</em>, covers the development of a new device, x86emu. We will learn how to customize and extend this device in the next few chapters.</p>
<p><a href="9c298b48-2f4c-434f-8b7b-eb44d1d8a25f.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Enabling the ARM Translator and Introducing Native Bridge</em>, explores a new feature introduced in Android 5--Native Bridge. Since we created an x86-based device, x86emu, we have to integrate the ARM translator module (Houdini) into our device so that most ARM-native applications can run on it.</p>
<p><a href="b6a6462f-1c3d-46fd-89e9-a543423c576d.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Debugging the Boot Up Process Using a Customized ramdisk</em>, introduces an advanced debugging skill to troubleshoot issues during the boot up stage. The famous Android-x86 project uses a special ramdisk to start the boot up process. It helps to troubleshoot device driver and init process issues very easily.</p>
<p><a href="7ff9a111-96cb-44ed-b92d-435e73821306.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Enabling Wi-Fi on the Android Emulator</em>, presents details of how to enable Wi-Fi on our Android emulator. The Android emulator only supports an emulated 3G data connection, but many applications are aware of data and the Wi-Fi connection. We demonstrate how to enable Wi-Fi in the Android emulator in this chapter.</p>
<p><a href="acf2363a-2a0f-40b9-a35f-c8bb0e523737.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Creating Your Own Device on VirtualBox</em>, explores how to port Android on VirtualBox by introducing a new device x86vbox. The x86emu device is used to demonstrate how to customize an existing implementation, while x86vbox is used to demonstrate how to port Android to a new hardware platform.</p>
<p><a href="c8d10155-cc8e-4b8c-a5e0-f359520c894a.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Booting Up x86vbox Using PXE/NFS</em>, explains how to boot up Android on VirtualBox using PXE/NFS. Since VirtualBox is a general virtual hardware, the first problem that we meet is we need a bootloader to boot the system. We will use the PXE/NFS boot to solve this issue. This is an advanced debugging skills which can be used in your own project.</p>
<p> To discuss a more advanced case about the PXE/NFS setup using an external DHCP/TFTP server running in the host-only network environment, I have written an article, which you can find at <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/booting-android-system-using-pxenfs">https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/booting-android-system-using-pxenfs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="900f7c1a-7db8-4172-899a-8e9a167372ce.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Enabling Graphics</em>, covers the Android graphic system. We introduce the Android graphics architecture and how to enable it on the x86vbox device.</p>
<p><a href="3c6453e9-98bb-4979-9c61-f0df071b1255.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Enabling VirtualBox-Specific Hardware Interfaces</em>, explains how to integrate the device drivers in VirtualBox Guest Additions into the Android system.</p>
<p><a href="5eff5635-ac58-4b48-80d4-b7e69b464d8e.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Introducing Recovery</em>, provides an introduction to recovery. We will learn how to customize and port recovery to a new hardware platform by building a recovery for the x86vbox device.</p>
<p><a href="32a9d777-755e-4758-a38a-f4e11d8ca2e9.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Creating OTA Packages</em>, covers the scripting language used by recovery: Edify. We will learn how to build and test OTA updates.</p>
<p><a href="15628e05-2216-4855-8347-588f61c8f61a.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Customizing and Debugging Recovery</em>, expands on the concepts we learned about recovery and OTA packages. We will customize both recovery and updater for x86vbox device. We will test third-party OTA packages from Gapps and Xposed using our own recovery.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Who this book is for</h1>
            

            
                
<p class="NormalPACKT">Before we talk about who should read this book, we should ask who are the people that usually do Android system programming in the real world? There are potentially quite a lot. Here, I can give a few general categories. Firstly, there are a large number of engineers at Google working on the Android system itself, since Android is a product from Google. Google usually work with silicon vendors to enable Android on various hardware platforms.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">There are many engineers at silicon chip companies, such as Qualcomm, MTK, or Intel to enable Android on their platform. They develop HAL layer components or device drivers to enable hardware platforms. The hardware platforms are usually called reference platforms, which are provided to OEM/ODM to build the actual products. Then, the engineers at OEM/ODM companies usually customize the reference platform hardware and software to add unique features to their products. All these engineers form the major groups working on system-level programming. Thus, if you are working in any of these areas, you may want to read this book.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">Besides the previously mentioned categories, it is also possible that you are a developer working for an embedded system company. You may work on projects such as embedded system for automobile, video surveillance, or smart home. Many of these systems use Android nowadays. One of the fastest growing areas in embedded systems is Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Google announced Brillo as the operating system for IoT devices. Brillo is a simplified embedded operating system based on Android. The source code of Brillo is also included in the AOSP. This book is also relevant to people who use Brillo.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">For Android application developers, system-level knowledge can help you to resolve complex issues as well. If you are working on projects that involve new hardware features, you may want to extend your knowledge to the system level.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">This book is also useful for people teaching Android system programming or embedded system programming. There is plenty of source code in this book that can be used to form your own lesson plans.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The general Android kernel source code is in the <kbd>kernel/common</kbd> folder , which looks very much like the Vanilla kernel."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>
static struct hw_module_methods_t lights_module_methods = {<br/>  .open = open_lights,<br/>};
</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>
<strong>$ ls</strong><br/><strong>Light.java LightsManager.java LightsService.java</strong>
</pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "We should set the launch type to Standard Create Process Launcher."</p>
<p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p>
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
