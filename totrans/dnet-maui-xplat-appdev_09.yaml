- en: In the second part of this book, we will explore the process of building a .NET
    MAUI Blazor Hybrid application. Blazor is a modern web framework developed by
    Microsoft, allowing developers to create interactive web applications using C#
    and Razor syntax rather than JavaScript. You might be familiar with JavaScript
    frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, among others. Unlike most frontend frameworks,
    which rely on JavaScript, Blazor utilizes C# as an alternative.

- en: Moreover, Blazor can be employed for developing Blazor Hybrid applications.
    In a Blazor Hybrid app, Razor components function natively on the device through
    an embedded Web View control, which enables the app to access device features,
    just like a native app would.

    Blazor Bindings, a new topic that allows you to leverage the power of Blazor within
    the .NET MAUI framework, expanding your options for application development.
