    you. The problem with printed books is that they're bulky, which means you can
    only take a handful at the most before they become unwieldy. Even worse, it's
    far too easy to forget or misplace a book – and then be stuck without it.

    but you can read any time you get a chance, such as waiting in line or traveling
