<p>This book will take our readers to a fun-filled ride where they will not just learn about the latest Android N SDK, but also about the other APIs and how they can create highly interactive and interesting games with them. The book will show readers how to create a complete game from scratch, designed for the Android platform. It will start by setting up the Android N SDK and other repositories, and then it will show readers how to customize the development environment. After this, it will show readers how to create game elements, objects, game layouts, game architecture, and game loops. It will create reusable Java code scripts, which will help you in your other game projects. An integral part of game development is to integrate images and graphics seamlessly. As we move ahead, we will show how to efficiently work with moving images, creating sprite animations, particle explosions, in-game entities, Bitmap fonts, and so on. Prototyping can decrease development time significantly; readers will implement prototyping techniques using the libgdx library. Toward the end of the book, readers will get a clear idea of improving game physics and the collision system, to give their game that real-life look.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "For instance, you can think of <kbd>www.google.com</kbd> as a website's domain name." A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>
&lt;TextView<br/>    android:text="Hello World!"<br/>    android:layout_width="wrap_content"<br/>    android:layout_height="wrap_content"<br/>    android:id="@+id/TextView"<br/>    tools:text="helloWorld"<br/>    android:textAppearance="@style/TextAppearance.AppCompat.Headline" /&gt;
</pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Click on Text, as shown in the following screenshot:"</p>
<p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p>
