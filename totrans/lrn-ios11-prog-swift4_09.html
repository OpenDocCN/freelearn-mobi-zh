            <p>The more we do storyboard work, the easier it gets. I remember that when I started
               Xcode, it was a bit overwhelming because of all the panels and it really took me time
               to get comfortable. Anytime I speak with someone looking to get into iOS, I always
               tell them to dedicate at least 10-15 minutes a day to it for the first six months.
               It seems like a lot, but it really makes a difference when you are trying to learn.
               If you step away for a week and try to come back, it is like starting from ground
               zero; at least, it was for me. When I finally started to catch on was when I was in
               Xcode everyday and was relentless.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the last chapter, we got our <span class="packt_screen">Explore</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Location</span> both set up. In this chapter, we are still working on just the structure and, in
               the next couple of chapters, we will work on design.  
            </p>
            
            <p>We will cover the following in this chapter:</p>

               <li>Restaurant View Controller</li>
               
               <li>Restaurant Detail View Controller</li>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>Our restaurant list will be the same basic setup we did in the last chapter. If you
               think you have a grasp of this, now is a good time to challenge yourself. If you think
               you still need more practice, keep reading and let's set up the restaurant list:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>Select the <kbd>Main.storyboard</kbd> file, making sure that you are zoomed out and can see all of your scenes (depending
                  on your screen resolution). In the Utilities panel, ensure that you have the object
                  library tab selected.
               </li>
               
               <li>In the filter field, you are going to type <kbd>viewcontroller</kbd>. Drag this view controller and put it next to Explore View Controller.
               </li>
               
               <li>Next, in the filter field, you are going to type <kbd>collectionview</kbd>.
               </li>
               
               <li>Click on and drag <span class="packt_screen">Collection View</span> and drop it onto the new <span class="packt_screen">View Controller</span> we just added next to the Explore View Controller.
               </li>
               
               <li>After you drop it onto the scene, select the Pin icon and enter the following values:</li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li style="list-style-type: none">
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>All values under <span class="packt_screen">Add New Constraints</span> are set to <kbd>0</kbd></li>
                     
                     <li>Make sure to uncheck <span class="packt_screen">Constrain to margins</span></li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <ol start="6">
               
               <li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Add 4 Constraints</span>.
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <p>We now have our <span class="packt_screen">Collection View</span> component set up for our Restaurant list.
            </p>

            <h1 class="header-title">Hooking up our outlets</h1>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>Let's now link our file, <kbd>RestaurantViewController</kbd>, to our new <kbd>UIViewController</kbd> in storyboard:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>Select the <kbd>UIViewController</kbd> with the <span class="packt_screen">Collection View</span> that we just created.
               </li>
               
               <li>Now, in the Utility panel, select the Identity inspector. Under <span class="packt_screen">Custom Class</span>, in the <span class="packt_screen">Class</span> drop-down menu, select <kbd>RestaurantViewController</kbd> and hit <em>Enter</em>.
               </li>
               
               <li>After you hit <em>Enter</em>, select the <span class="packt_screen">Connections Inspector</span> in the Utilities panel.
               </li>
               
               <li>Under <span class="packt_screen">Outlets</span>, click on the <kbd>collectionView</kbd> circle and drag from the circle to <span class="packt_screen">Collection View</span> that we just added inside of your <kbd>UIViewController</kbd>.
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <p>Now that we have our <span class="packt_screen">Collection View</span> hooked up, we need to hook up the data source and delegate. This allows us to pass
               data to our <span class="packt_screen">Collection View</span> as well as know when our <span class="packt_screen">Collection View</span> has some kind of interaction.
            </p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>In your scene, select your <span class="packt_screen">Collection View</span>. Then, in your Utilities panel, select the <span class="packt_screen">Connections Inspector</span>.
               </li>
               
               <li>Click on and drag the <kbd>dataSource</kbd> property to the Restaurant View Controller in your Outline view.
               </li>
               
               <li>Click on and drag the delegate property to the Restaurant View Controller in your
                  Outline view.
               </li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <p>Finally, let's set up our cell to have a color so we can make sure we have everything
               set up correctly.
            </p>

            <p>In <kbd>Main.storyboard</kbd>, select the small box  inside of your <span class="packt_screen">Collection View</span>. This is your <span class="packt_screen">Collection View</span> prototype cell.

            <ol start="3">
               
               <li>Now, CTL drag from the explore cell to Restaurant View Controller:</li>
               
            </ol>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="443" src="assets/e84f62f1-c68f-4e7f-82a6-5821b580646f.png" width="561"/></div>
            
            <ol start="4">
               
               <li>When you let go, you will be presented with the following menu and you should select
                  <span class="packt_screen">Show</span>:
               </li>

            <p>Now, let's run the project by hitting the Play button (or using <em>cmd</em> + <em>R</em>). You will now be able to tap on an explore cell  and see the following:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="474" src="assets/4a374171-391e-46dc-ae5f-48fa70f496d2.png" width="232"/></div>
            
            <p>Next, we want when the user taps on a restaurant that they are presented with the
               restaurant details. We will use a static Table View Controller to do our detail. Using
               a static Table View, it allows us to create content without code. We will still have
               to hook up our data but, in the following chapters, you will see how static Table
               Views come in handy. Let's set up the restaurant detail:
            </p>
            
            <ol>

               <li>In the filter field, you are going to type: <kbd>tableviewcontroller</kbd> (make sure it's the controller—it will have a yellow icon). Drag this Table View
                  Controller and put it next to Restaurant View Controller:
               </li>

               <li>Back in the filter field, you are going to type <kbd>button</kbd>. Drag this button and put it in the static Table View. For now, it does not matter
                  which cell; when we work on design, we will update this.

            <p>The last thing we need to do is set up our <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab. Select the <kbd>Main.storyboard</kbd> file and find the <span class="packt_screen">View Controller</span> connected to the <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab:

            <p>We now have both tabs set up, but, as we progress through the book, we will add more

            <p>In this chapter, we have finished the application structure. We hooked up our explore
               cell to a restaurant list. Then, we were able to connect a restaurant to a detail.
               Next, we added a button in our details, which allows us to see restaurant reviews.
               Lastly, we added a map to our <span class="packt_screen">Map</span> tab.
            </p>
            
            <p>At this point, a good challenge would be to see if you can get back to this point.
               Starting from when we created the project towards the end of <a href="75201e71-726f-4ab1-8d45-bb84774b10e6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Starting the UI Setup</em>, in the <em>Creating a new project</em> section. See if you can go from that point to here without the book and without missing
               anything. This will really help you and it is something I like to do with those I
               mentor.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the next chapter, we will start digging more into the design and getting our app
               to visually look like the design.
