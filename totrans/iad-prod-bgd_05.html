If you haven't got it open in<span class="strong"><strong> iAd Producer</strong></span>, open it now.</li><li class="listitem">First up, let's set up our two blank templates. Double-click the first page on the<span class="strong"><strong> ad overview</strong></span> to open the template chooser. There are two blank templates to choose from, either portrait or landscape; we want a portrait page, so select the taller, thinner of the two. Repeat this step for the next page as well.</li><li class="listitem">Now, double-click the third page, and select<span class="strong"><strong> Wallpaper Picker</strong></span> from the template chooser. Double-click the wallpaper page again, to open it on the canvas.</li><li class="listitem">The<span class="strong"><strong> Wallpaper Picker</strong></span> template requires one or more images that it'll display in a gallery. The user can flick through the images and set their favorite as the background on their device. Let's add three images to our wallpaper picker. Open the<span class="strong"><strong> Asset Library</strong></span> pane, and highlight the three image files<span class="strong"><strong> wallpaper-1.jpg - wallpaper-3.jpg</strong></span>. To select multiple items, single-click on the first file, and then hold the<span class="emphasis"><em> shift</em></span> key down while clicking on the last file. Drag the highlighted group to the placeholder image on the canvas.</li><li class="listitem">The first image should appear on the canvas. Now that we've added the images, we can update the style of the page to improve its appearance. Images look great against a black background, so we'll update the background color of our page to black.</li><li class="listitem">Single-click the background of the ad, and open the inspector pane. In the<span class="strong"><strong> Background</strong></span> section, set<span class="strong"><strong> Background Type</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> Color Fill</strong></span> and the color to black.</li><li class="listitem">With our new black background, the title of our page is hard to read; as we have the<span class="strong"><strong> Set as wallpaper</strong></span> text in the button, we can safely delete the label without confusing the user as to the purpose of the page. Single-click the label with the text<span class="strong"><strong> Wallpaper Picker</strong></span>, and press the<span class="emphasis"><em> delete</em></span> or<span class="emphasis"><em> backspace</em></span> keys to remove it from the canvas.</li><li class="listitem">As we have extra screen space available now, let's enlarge the size of our images in the wallpaper picker gallery. Single-click the gallery to select it, and then click-and-drag the top-center drag handle towards the top of the page. You may notice that the left and right drag handles are already at the full width of the page, even though our image is quite thin. This is due to<span class="strong"><strong> iAd Producer</strong></span> adding<span class="strong"><strong> padding</strong></span> to our image. Padding bulks out the area an object takes up by adding empty space around it. We can adjust the padding; with the object still selected, open the<span class="strong"><strong> inspector</strong></span> pane and expand the<span class="strong"><strong> Layout</strong></span> section. In the<span class="strong"><strong> Layout</strong></span> section, we can change<span class="strong"><strong> Padding X</strong></span>, the horizontal (or left and right) padding, and<span class="strong"><strong> Padding Y</strong></span>, the vertical (or top and bottom) padding. We only want to adjust the width, so try reducing<span class="strong"><strong> Padding X</strong></span> to a smaller value, for example,<span class="emphasis"><em> 75</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id217"/><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"/>Tip</h3><p>Keep in mind that there is always a button visible at the top-left of our iAd, to let users close the ad. This should be visible in iAd Producer, so avoid placing objects near it, and never have tappable, interactive buttons close to it, in case users close your ad instead of performing their intended action.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Once you're happy with the size of your images, let's continue tweaking our gallery. iPhone applications often use paging dots underneath flickable areas, to show which page you're on, and to indicate when more pages are visible. You may have noticed them on the home screen of your iPhone or iPad, where all your apps are shown. We can add these dots to our gallery by ticking the<span class="strong"><strong> Show Dots</strong></span> checkbox in the<span class="strong"><strong> Properties</strong></span> section of the inspector pane. You might need to adjust the height of the gallery to accommodate the dots. Our complete gallery should look like the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — pages" src="graphics/1321_05_10.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now, preview the ad in the iOS Simulator or on a device. You may notice that you're unable to return to the menu, from the gallery, as the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> button seems unresponsive. This is due to the iAd framework placing our gallery over the top of the button, even though it doesn't appear this way, in iAd Producer. We can make sure that the button is always on top of other objects by right-clicking on the button and selecting<span class="strong"><strong> Bring to Front</strong></span>, as shown in the following screenshot:<a class="indexterm" id="id218"/><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — pages" src="graphics/1321_05_11.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Test your iAd again, and you should be able to return to the menu from the wallpaper picker page.</li><li class="listitem">Now open the ad overview by clicking on the<span class="strong"><strong> Overview</strong></span> navigation arrow in the top-left of<span class="strong"><strong> iAd Producer</strong></span>. You can now see the structure of our ad forming, but what if we want to change the order in which our pages appear? In the ad overview, we can click-and-drag the pages of our iAd, to adjust how they appear in the ad. Try dragging the<span class="strong"><strong> Wallpaper Picker</strong></span> page from the last page to the middle. The menu templates in your ad will automatically update to show the new order of your pages.<a class="indexterm" id="id219"/><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip06"/>Tip</h3><p>Remember that you can only change the order of your pages, and not the banner, splash, or menu/core ad unit, in your iAd. Your ad has to follow that set flow defined by Apple.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Before we finish with our pages, we can rename the blank templates ready for us to build up with objects later. Continuing to remain in the ad overview, single-click the first page to select it. In the<span class="strong"><strong> Properties</strong></span> section of<span class="strong"><strong> inspector</strong></span>, change the name to<code class="literal"> Bean Blender</code>.

Under the<span class="strong"><strong> STYLES</strong></span> heading, there is a drop-down textbox with<span class="strong"><strong> Custom</strong></span> written in it; click on the cog icon to the right of that, and select<span class="strong"><strong> Save as...</strong></span>, to save a new style preset.</li><li class="listitem">iAd Producer shows which properties will be included with the style.

Double-click on the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> page to open it on the canvas.</li><li class="listitem">Single-click on the menu object to select it, and then open the<span class="strong"><strong> Inspector</strong></span> and find the<span class="strong"><strong> SETTINGS</strong></span> heading.

When you select a different state, any styles you apply will only appear when the button is in that state.

Lowering the opacity makes the button slightly transparent, washing out the color, and showing the background slightly behind it.
