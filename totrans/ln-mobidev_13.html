<p>In order to continually learn from your MVP, you must be continually running tests, collecting data, and evolving your app. However, one barrier to validated learning comes in the form of the App Stores themselves.</p>
<p>As we will see next, the two platforms have different limitations and requirements that impact every aspect and stage of an app's release. Store listing requirements, app approval delays, analytics, and beta deployment options, for instance, all differ between the two platforms.</p>
<p>However, there are ways to workaround these challenges. In this chapter, we will explore the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What split testing is and why it is a crucial tool for every app developer</li>
<li>How to run split tests in both store listings and in apps</li>
<li>How to overcome limitations and obstacles that are inevitable when performing real-world split testing</li>
<li>Essential split testing techniques, as well as examples of how to run split tests in the App Store and in Google Play</li>
</ul>
<p>Before covering these topics, let's briefly elaborate on what experiments are:</p>

<p>As in science, a business experiment posits a hypothesis, and then runs a test or tests to validate or invalidate that idea. In the lean methodology, MVPs are experiments that test fundamental hypotheses about value and growth—that is, whether your idea solves a problem and whether your product can grow sustainably.</p>
<p>Though the MVP is an experiment itself, there are many other experiments that you can run within that context. In this chapter, we will cover the obstacles to testing inside the App Stores, workarounds that allow you to split test inside your app and inside the App Stores, and, finally, we will look at how you can apply these skills with a pair of practical examples.</p>

<p>Split tests can be viewed as experiments, like any other experiment, which begins with a hypothesis. These tests are much smaller in scale when compared to large-scale hypotheses, such as the value hypothesis upon which the entire MVP is built. However, the underlying principle is the same.</p>
<p>For those who do not know, a split test serves alternate versions of a web page or app, for instance, to a group of users in order to determine which version converts the highest. In a two-way split test, called an A/B test, you might test two separate landing page headlines in order to test their impact on conversion rates.</p>
<p>You can also test the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copywriting, such as headlines or calls-to-action</li>
<li>Design elements, such as colors or button shapes</li>
<li>App Store listing elements, such as screenshots or descriptions</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be covered in more detail as follows, but there are a number of benefits to split testing. Here are some of the biggest benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split testing allows you to better understand your users</li>
<li>Conversion rates can be improved, that is, it's a bread-and-butter optimization method</li>
<li>You can improve the user experience and usability</li>
<li>Important metrics, such as user retention and time-in-app, can be more deeply understood and improved</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two types of app experiments that we will cover in this chapter: store listing tests and app tests.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>App Store rankings, such as search engine rankings, have an enormous impact on how many people find and try your app. If you can improve your store listing's ranking and its conversion rate, then you stand to reap significant benefits as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved organic discovery and more users</li>
<li>Increased download rates</li>
<li>Decreased cost of user acquisition</li>
</ul>
<p>Improving your App Store ranking, or <strong>App Store Optimization</strong> (<strong>ASO</strong>), has been called the new SEO, as a testament to its importance. Keeping in line with other search engines across the internet, App Store search algorithms rank based on a variety of predictable factors, such as keyword relevance and user reviews.</p>
<p>The app marketplaces have never published best practices that can guide developers on how they can improve their App Store rankings. However, widespread unofficial ASO improvement techniques focus on a few important areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download rates and uninstall rates</li>
<li>The quality of the reviews from users</li>
<li>Relevancy of the keywords in the headline and description</li>
<li>Usefulness of the listing copy, the icon, screenshots, and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>Listing tests are split tests that are designed to help you improve all of these areas, either directly or indirectly. Every time you split test elements, you will measure the result that you are trying to impact. An A/B test, for example, could compare two versions of a description, then use install rates to measure the results of that test. A test that compares review solicitation mechanisms could examine the impact on positive reviews.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Split testing the app itself is another crucial tool in your experimentation toolbox. While App Store listing tests will help you improve conversion rates, app testing helps you learn about your users, improve your product, and increase engagement rates.</p>
<p>When testing the app, you will perform split tests designed to improve the app experience, usability, and engagement. App tests can be performed on any number of app-related variables, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen design</li>
<li>User flow</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Buttons</li>
</ul>
<p>Appropriate metrics that can help you judge your testing efforts include engagement metrics, such as time in app and retention rates or conversion rates for specific targets. A change designed to improve the conversion rates for advertising, for instance, should measure ad conversion rates. As with App Store listing tests, you should focus on metrics that measure the result you are trying to impact with any given test.</p>

<p>App testing is not just icing on the cake, since such experiments can make or break an app. Testing has become a critical facet of the lean developer's <em>modus operandi</em>, so it pays to understand what makes testing so valuable.</p>

<p>Apps need a way to stand out in a saturated, competitive marketplace. According to Statista, Google Play grew from 1 million apps in July 2013 to 2.8 million in March, 2017. Between June 2013 and January 2017, the App Store count grew from 900,000 to 2.2 million.</p>
<p>This ocean of apps poses two concerns—not only do developers need to stay visible in the ocean of apps, they need to engage their users' attention and keep it.</p>
<p>Although people spend dozens of hours per month using apps, they are quick to abandon apps that bore them. According to 2016 data from Localytics, which was widely publicized on major tech blogs, nearly one in four users will abandon an app after only one use. A number of causes can lie behind app abandonment rates, from users' busy schedules to usability issues.</p>
<p>Though not all of these causes can be influenced, there is one reason that developers use experimentation to stay competitive.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>As with engagement metrics, conversion rates are impacted by a number of factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traffic source</strong>: The exact number changes depending on where you get your information, but studies usually show that between 40-50% or more users find apps by searching in the App Store. Think with Google reports that one in four users find their apps through a search.</li>
<li><strong>The app listing itself</strong>: As mentioned, every element of an App Store listing can impact conversion rates, from the icon to the description to the screenshots.</li>
<li><strong>The industry</strong>: Not all industries have the same average conversion rates. Music apps, according to data published by splitmetrics, have the highest App Store conversion rates, while games have the lowest.</li>
<li><strong>App pricing</strong>: Free apps are governed by different averages than paid apps. In general, free apps have higher download rates, but they also have higher abandonment rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to impact any of these factors is by performing experiments. Split testing can improve App Store conversion rates by 20% or more.</p>
<p>Decreased conversion rates, in turn, decrease the cost of user acquisition, while in-app split tests help you improve engagement metrics, which often has a direct impact on your revenue model.</p>
<p>Although the app marketplaces pose their own difficulties, these are not insurmountable. Next, we will look at some of these obstacles and how to overcome them so you can make the most of your tests.</p>

<p>Once your MVP becomes listed on the App Stores, it becomes harder to split test. Your app becomes bound by the rules of each App Store. Then, when you want to update, you must wait for the App Store's approval. Additionally, certain limitations inhibit your ability to run tests or collect accurate data.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Each of the two major platforms behaves differently and each has its own set of listing requirements. Generally, Google Play is easier for testing, since re-listing takes less time, the requirements are less strict, and it offers simple split testing options for the store listing. However, the App Store's significant audience—and that audience's purchasing power—is reason enough to code for iOS.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the major platform differences that make testing all the more difficult.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Different app listing requirements</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>When listing your app, you must learn to operate in two separate ecosystems. Not only do you have to code each app differently, you need to learn the ropes for maximizing visibility in each marketplace.</p>
<p>Here are three examples and different requirements for each App Store as of the writing of this book:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>App titles</strong>: On Google Play, titles are limited to 50 characters, while on the App Store they are limited to 30.</li>
<li><strong>App descriptions</strong>: Apple does not have a short description. But it does have a "Subtitle". Subtitle is limited to 30 characters. If the differences between the two platforms with description feels too complicted, we swap this item for Promotional text. Apple's promotional text is limited to 170 characters. Google terms this field "Release notes" and it is lmited to 500 characters.</li>
<li><strong>App categories</strong>: The App Store allows you to choose a primary and secondary category, but special cases allow you to add more categories, thus increasing potential visibility. Google Play, on the other hand, only allows one mutual category for both apps and games. Google allows for an application type along with the category.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the differences that you must take into account when running App Store optimization tests. The other differences between the two stores include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of screenshots allowed</li>
<li>The length of promo videos allowed</li>
<li>Whether social media actions are allowed</li>
<li>Whether promo graphics are allowed</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Each store offers separate metrics with which to measure the results of your experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: You can view sales and trends through iTunes Connect, which gives you access to data and reports on downloads and sales. App Analytics is an analytics package that tracks many standard metrics, such as engagement, monetization, and marketing.</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong>: From the Google Developer console, you can track user acquisition with the option to narrow your focus on specific acquisition channels, locations, and time periods. Google Analytics for mobile or Firebase Analytics, similar to Apple's analytics package, allows you to track monetization, engagement, and marketing efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since these precise numbers differ, you will not be able to measure results in parallel, even if these experiments are conducted simultaneously. It is worth mentioning that Apple and Google are both continually improving their tools to make testing easier, so some specific features may have changed by the time of publication.</p>

<p>Once your app is listed, you have limited options when it comes to split testing in the store itself. Apple, in general, has a reputation for enforcing stricter standards across its App Store, from screenshots to keywords to bugs. Therefore, it is not surprising that they offer no support for split testing.</p>
<p>Google Play allows you to split test store listings. With this program, you can create two types of experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global</strong>: Global tests allow you to test graphics, screenshots, the promo video, and the icon. These tests only affect your app's default language, so the ones using other languages will still be shown their default localized versions.</li>
<li><strong>Localized</strong>: When you perform a localized test, you can test all of the preceding variables, plus descriptions in as many as five languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiments are created and run from the Google Developer console, where you can choose targeting information, attributes, variants, and more.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>It may be clear by now why running experiments side by side is no easy task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different store listing requirements means that each listing must be different</li>
<li>Different coding requirements makes parallel app creation difficult</li>
<li>Different A/B testing capabilities in each App Store means you cannot run the same listing tests simultaneously</li>
<li>Different metrics means you will be measuring slightly different results</li>
<li>Different turnaround times for each store means your updates will have different timelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Another challenge is that since testing conditions fluctuate with time, it is difficult to maintain strong controls and reliable results when testing serially. For instance, user behavior and market temperament could vary enough between two time periods to alter the results of two otherwise identical tests. Though effective testing clearly has its share of roadblocks, there are ways to overcome these challenges, as we will see next.</p>

Each of the upcoming sections will cover some essential techniques for working around the platform limitations that have been discussed so far.</p>

<p>As mentioned, Google Play allows you to split test core elements of the listing itself, while Apple does not. If, however, you want to expand your testing options and perform more complex multivariate testing, you will need to explore other options.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Knowing where users come from and how they discover your apps can be very useful, both for testing and for your business. Not only can you learn about how various traffic sources compare in terms of quantity and quality, you can also perform tests outside the App Store, which can then offer more information about your customers.</p>
<p>Before examining the experiments themselves, it pays to briefly examine the major discovery portals and traffic sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>App Store search</strong>: As mentioned previously, think with Google research discovered that at least 40% of users find new apps by searching within the App store itself, making it one of your most important traffic sources. For this reason, App Store indexing and optimization should be top priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Traditional search</strong>: The same study also reported that 27% of users discovered apps through search engines, making search another critical traffic source.</li>
<li><strong>App packs</strong>: App packs are grids that appear above, within, or below standard Google search results when the search engine determines that a person is searching for an app. The apps that appear in App packs are chosen by the search engine, not the App Store rankings. However, since the search algorithms rely on many of the same factors, the results are strongly correlated.</li>
<li><strong>Deep linking</strong>: Deep linking, or URIs that open up apps, can be triggered from a variety of places, including search ads and other digital ads. In the event that an app is not installed, users will be directed to install the app, which can then complete the action initiated by the original link.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned, Google will allow you to perform in-store listing tests. Since certain traffic sources, such as in-store searches and app packs, send users directly to these listings, Android developers should certainly take advantage of this option.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Although you cannot test listings in Apple's App Store—and although there are limitations to tests you can run inside Google Play—you can still use external landing pages to test essential content such as screenshots, headlines, icons, and descriptions.</p>
<p>To perform this technique, which has been called microtesting by some, you simply experiment with a landing page that mimics the App Store listing itself. Create a test that mirrors the appearance of the App Store as closely as possible and when users click on the install button, direct them to the actual store listing.</p>
<p>After the testing period has finished, use the highest-converting landing page to recreate your App Store listing.</p>
<p>To track and analyze results, you should utilize a split testing platform. Some are free and some are paid, but given the benefits they provide, paid platforms can be well worth the investment. A few of the most popular include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Analytics</strong>: This is an essential testing solution that is included as part of Google Analytics, making it easy to use and work into any existing GA workflow</li>
<li><strong>Optimizely</strong>: This is one of the world's most popular split testing options, offering features that extend far beyond a straight landing page test</li>
<li><strong>Unbounce</strong>: This is another extremely popular landing page platform, with an easy-to-use landing page builder</li>
<li><strong>Kissmetrics</strong>: This is one of the world's most robust split testing and analytics platforms; Kissmetrics is ideal for deep customer research</li>
</ul>
<p>A little research will help you determine which price point meets your budget and which features meet your needs. For the teams that plan to engage in expansive tracking, such as marketing tests and app tests, it is worth looking at platforms that are more in-depth. Kissmetrics, for example, offers analytics for both apps and websites, so you can manage, view, and review more of your analytics from a single place.</p>

<p>In the same way that you can use split testing to experiment with multiple versions of web page elements, you can run tests that collect data on in-app elements, including design elements and workflow changes. This approach is the practical application of the build-measure-learn cycle you measure data, learn from it, and build new iterations.</p>
<p>When working with preproduction versions, you can run tests in parallel. Testing two versions of the app simultaneously doubles the amount of information you can collect.</p>
<p>The following are the ways in which you can run parallel tests on both platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Alpha Deployments</strong>: Before releasing your app to production, you can perform open and closed alpha and beta tests with users who have Google Accounts or G Suite accounts. Since you can only run one open and one closed at the same time, Google recommends testing a closed alpha alongside an open beta.</li>
<li><strong>Apple TestFligh</strong>t: This operates similarly to Google Alpha Deployments, allowing you to create open or closed beta tests. You can segment multiple builds among up to 2,000 open beta testers, which gives you plenty of room to receive feedback on different versions of your app.</li>
<li><strong>Third party applications</strong>: There are a number of services that help streamline beta deployment and distribution. Install, DeployGate, and Fabric, which was acquired by Google in early 2017, are platforms that make this stage of prototyping easier and more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the right approach to deployment, and a creative approach to split testing your listing, it is possible to hack your way past some of the obstacles posed by the two app marketplaces. Next, we will apply some of the skills and tools we have examined so far by looking at example experiments in the App Store and in Google Play.</p>

<p>An experimental, scientific approach is the foundation of the Lean method.</p>
<p>Experimentation and split testing are fundamental tools in every developer's toolkit, but running tests in the marketplace can be tricky and messy. The techniques covered in this chapter can help you circumvent real-world limitations and obstacles, improve learning, and accelerate growth. The examples provided can give you ideas on how to run your own experiments in either the App Store or in Google Play.</p>
<p>With the right tools, the right techniques, and a creative approach to testing, you can continue to learn and experiment, even after you have launched your product in an app marketplace.</p>
<p>Now it is time to look at how we can use split tests to find out what works best in our apps as we seek to create apps that our customers will love.</p>
