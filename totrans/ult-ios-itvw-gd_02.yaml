    needs to be added for many developers, and that’s *how to be a player in the iOS
    developers’ labor market*. Playing in this market requires us to learn and adapt

    of self-expression, wording, communication, and even marketing.

    the company and its product, we can quickly understand what he is talking about.
    But moreover, knowing the product will point our answers in the *right direction
    and context*. There’s a big difference between answering an architecture question
    when interviewing for a social app company and an advertising company building
    an SDK. In an iOS development world, these are two different creatures. We will

    a medium tech company employs under 1,000 employees, and a company with over 1,000
    employees is considered to be large.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in our discussion, it doesn’t matter much. What matters is what it means to us
    as employees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Small* companies allow us to produce a *more significant impact* on the company
    and its product. It usually means working in small teams; sometimes teams that
    are one person only(!). And because these companies are small, they also give
    us an *intimate feeling*, which comes with a *good work/life balance*. Another
    pro for small companies is the pace – it’s *much faster.* The fast pace is mainly
    because small teams have simplified working flows. Small companies also have downsides.
    They are mostly *less stable* than bigger companies and have *less room to grow*
    your career.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Large* companies are the opposite. Even though they are much *more stable,*
    the employee has a much *smaller impact* on the company product and its path.
    To gain more influence in large companies, we need to move up in the hierarchy,
    which, unlike small companies, is much easier. Also, the pace of development is
    *much slower* due to more dependencies between teams and company regulations.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a way, *medium* companies are like a mix of large and small. They still provide
    an *intimate family* environment while being more stable than small companies.
    Therefore, it is not surprising that medium companies are the preferable firms
    by most tech workers. The combination of stability, a warm environment, and fast
    development pace fulfill the preferences of most people in the industry.

    And just like a human, each stage of their life cycle has its own excitement and
    risks. As a result, when searching for a company, one thing to look at is the
    stage in its life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    It can tell us the opportunities and whether the company is at a stage where everything
    is ticking, or if we need to set up workflows from the ground up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    itself. The company can be mature, but the mobile team was just born. Regardless
    of the different opportunities a new team may have, there can also be differences
    in the *technology* it uses, and that’s also a critical issue in our interviews.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many cases, interviewers tend to ask questions about the technology they
    use or want to use in their projects. For example, if we’re talking about a mature
    mobile team, its developers probably use **UIKit** and might even use **Objective-C**
    (God forbid!). In this case, expect questions about **UIViews** or **Objective-C**
    categories and blocks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    code,* which can be painful to deal with and sometimes requires refactoring.
  prefs: []

    the company’s stage, the team, and the project. The answers we’ll get can give
    us an overview of what we might expect in our interview and the workplace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, notice that the question, “In what stage is the company right now?” is
    not always a straightforward question, and not all interviewers can answer that
    easily. You need to dig in a little bit deeper when asking questions and conclude
    yourself. One of the things we need to consider when analyzing the company’s state
    is whether it is public or private.
  prefs: []

    ownership. A private company is owned by one or a few individuals, while a public
    company is owned by shareholders who have bought stock.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is difficult to say which type of company is “better” to work for, as this
    will depend on an individual’s personal preferences and career goals. Some developers
    may prefer the stability and potential for growth that a large public company
    can offer. In contrast, others may prefer a smaller private company’s flexibility
    and entrepreneurial spirit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are confused between the “public versus private” and the “large versus
    small” argument, it is not a coincidence. Public companies are generally more
    prominent. They are more structured, while private companies are considered to
    be smaller.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there’s much more than just size. The ownership difference has an impact
    on the company culture. For example, in public companies, the decision-making
    process is more complex due to the need to consider the interests of the shareholders.
    That’s not the case with a private company with a more agile and faster process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    answers from the interviewer. I’m not saying he is a liar! But remember, one of

    with us.

    to meet deadlines, it shows happy hour events and talks about loyalty. Still,
    on the other hand, they say nothing about flexibility, it may be a good indication
    of how the company feels about **work-life balance**. If the job description describes

    process, the different stages, and their primary goals, but now, I want to discuss
    the period before the interview.

    candidates do is schedule as soon as possible because of the excitement of getting
    an interview. Well, that’s a bold mistake.

    frame between one and two weeks should be enough to start the first stage.

    There are three levels we need to ensure we are ready: **Technical**, **Personal**,
    and **Logistics**.'

- en: Most of the books that talk about iOS interviews deal with technical preparations.
    In this period, the first thing we need to ensure is that the *foundation of iOS
    development* is strong and solid. Screwing up on the fundamental questions and
    tasks will devastate us and risk our job application more than anything.

- en: The second thing we need to do is *get a whiteboard* to practice design and
    architecture questions. In design questions, we need to get used to drawing a
    UML or a system chart on a whiteboard. Even though drawing on a whiteboard sounds
    easy, it requires practice and experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides the drawing task itself (which is not that easy for many candidates),
    we need to know how to present a system, decide what we consider a module in our
    chart, and explain it verbally. We will focus on that in *Part 4:* *Design and
    Architecture* of this book, but we need to make time for that in our preparation
    plan.

- en: The third thing is *building our daily routine*. Whether we have a daily job
    or are unemployed, without a daily practice routine, it’s going to be hard to
    move forward and close all the knowledge gaps. Are we night or morning people?
    Knowing who we are can help reserve a slot dedicated to practice in our schedule.

- en: Our personality is another important side of the process. As part of the interview
    preparations, we must build our story as developers. What is our story? How did
    we get into the development world, especially iOS development? Why did we decide
    to work in the places that we worked in the past? How was it to work in a big
    or small company? Why do we search now for a new workplace?

    so we must not forget that in our preparation planning.

- en: This is the easy part, but we must not fall for this one. We first need to *print
    our resumes*. It is always good to bring them with us. Bringing our resumes shows
    that we are serious and have got nothing to hide. It also starts the interview
    by focusing on us, which is precisely what we wanted.

    our odds of continuing the process, but late sure can. Never – never be late for
    an interview.

- en: 'The third thing may sound weird and unrelated, but it is much more important
    than you think: *make sure you smell good*. Now, I mention the smell, because
    many people (interviewers, in our case) tend to associate a smell with the person
    they talk with. Now, just to be clear, the link between smell and people is not
    the interviewer’s fault; it’s just how our brain is built. There’s a direct connection
    between memory, emotion, and our sense of smell. It can be a good idea to put
    deodorant or perfume in our bag during our on-site interview.'
