- en: Now that you have been introduced to MIT App Inventor 2 and you have learned
    about your new role as an app developer and designer, let's get started with the
    technical setup! MIT App Inventor is a free web-based application that runs on
    a web browser and saves your projects on the cloud. The magical part about MIT
    App Inventor is that you can live test your app during each stage of development.
    In order to do this, you will need to set up connectivity that includes downloading
    software to connect your computer to your Android mobile device or between the
    onscreen emulator.

    a web browser, a Google account, an Android phone or tablet (but if you don't
    have one, you can use the onscreen emulator), and a way to connect your computer
    to your phone (either with WiFi or a USB cable). Setting up MIT App Inventor for
    the first time can be a little daunting, but if you follow the steps based on
    your operating system and how you will be connecting (via WiFi, a USB cable, or
    an emulator), it can be a straightforward process. And remember, once you complete
    the technical setup, you can start building mobile apps!

    web application on your computer to an Android mobile device or onscreen emulator
    takes some time and patience. But we guarantee it is worth the effort. As you
    start building an app and seeing its live development on your mobile device (or
    emulator), it is not only exciting and satisfying, but necessary and helpful for
    designing, troubleshooting, and testing. If you get stuck, you can always visit
    the support pages on the MIT App Inventor website ([http://appinventor.mit.edu/](http://appinventor.mit.edu/))
    or ask for help in the community forum. Now that the technical setup is over,
    the fun is about to begin! Let's learn how to make mobile apps with the MIT App
    Inventor!
