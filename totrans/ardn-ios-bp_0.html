On my desk lay an Arduino board that was almost unused. A thought came to me—it would be great to integrate the iOS platform and Arduino. I could control almost everything from anywhere, from my home to industrial machines.</p><p>I started working on this and I eventually designed Arduino Manager. It is a general-purpose iOS application based on widgets, which acquires data from Arduino and depicts it with gauges, graphs, and other means. Arduino Manager allows you to control an Arduino board through switches, knobs, sliders, and other means (more information on this is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://apple.co/1NPfL6i">http://apple.co/1NPfL6i</a>).</p><p>This book shows some of the basic techniques that I developed during these years to make the Arduino and iOS devices work together.</p><p>I will show you how to build five amazing projects, and you will learn how the additional electronics around Arduino work. You will also learn how to use digital and analog sensors, program the Arduino board, and develop iOS applications that can transfer data with Arduino. Projects are described in detail, providing you with a learning tool and not just some sketches or some iOS code to copy.</p><p>I promise that you will not get bored.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Arduino and iOS – Platforms and Integration" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S2">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Arduino and iOS – Platforms and Integration</em></span>, will give you a brief introduction to the two platforms and introduce the integration methods between them. Moreover, you will learn how to set up the development environments on both the platforms and get ready for the projects in the subsequent chapters.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Bluetooth Pet Door Locker" href="part0019.xhtml#aid-I3QM1">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Bluetooth Pet Door Locker</em></span>, develops a project that helps you automatically lock the pet door at night by measuring the external light, monitoring whether it is locked or unlocked, and manually operating it as needed. This is done by using an iOS device.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Wi-Fi Power Plug" href="part0026.xhtml#aid-OPEK1">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Wi-Fi Power Plug</em></span>, is about learning how to make a smart power plug that is controlled thorough Wi-Fi. This is not based on the traditional relay technique, and the iOS application is full of useful features.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 4. iOS Guided Rover" href="part0033.xhtml#aid-VF2I1">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>iOS Guided Rover</em></span>, will teach you how to control a rover robot by using voice commands and moving your iOS device.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 5. TV Set Constant Volume Controller" href="part0039.xhtml#aid-1565U1">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>TV Set Constant Volume Controller</em></span>, is for people who are bored by the high volume of commercials. You will learn how to make an automatic IR controller that keeps the TV set's volume constant.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 6. Automatic Garage Door Opener" href="part0045.xhtml#aid-1AT9A1">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Automatic Garage Door Opener</em></span>, covers a project that will allow you to automatically open your garage door by just getting close enough to it, without even touching the iOS device. The project takes advantage of the iBeacon technology.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book" id="aid-8IL21"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>To build the hardware side of the projects, you will need an Arduino board and some other electronic components.</p><p>To develop the Arduino firmware, you just need the Arduino IDE, which can be downloaded for free from the Arduino site.</p><p>To develop the iOS applications, you need the Xcode development environment (available for free from Apple). Since the Xcode is available only for the MAC platform, you need an Intel-based MAC computer. Most of the projects are based on Bluetooth 4 protocol. Hence, you need an iOS device that supports this protocol.</p><p>Everything is explained in detail in <a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Arduino and iOS – Platforms and Integration" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S2">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Arduino and iOS – Platforms and Integration</em></span>.</p></div>
