		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Chapter 2</em>: Using the New iOS 14 Apps</h1>
			<p>In 2020, Apple introduced iOS 14, the latest operating system for the iPhone. Besides adding new features, iOS 14 also includeds a <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> and a <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app. The Translate app lets you convert spoken or written words into another language, while the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app lets you turn your iPhone camera into a magnifying glass to help you read text that may be too small to read comfortably. </p>
			<p>By learning how to use these new apps, as well as using the new features of iOS 14, you can get comfortable with using common user interface elements of iPhone apps. Since most apps work in similar ways, the more apps you use, the easier it will be to use your iPhone. </p>
			<p>In the last chapter, you learned how to use common finger gestures to control different features of an iPhone. In this chapter, you'll learn the common elements of iOS by experimenting with the latest features of iOS 14: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">App Library</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Using the Magnifier app</h1>
			<p>Many people have a <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>hard time reading text up close. This can be due to farsightedness or trying to read small print in low-lighting conditions. If you ever forget or <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>misplace your reading glasses, you can use the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app on your iPhone, which appears as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.1</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.1 – The Magnifier app&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.01_B14100.jpg"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – The Magnifier app<a id="_idTextAnchor079"/><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/></p>
			<p>To start the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app, you need to use two different gestures: swipe and tap. First, you'll need to use the <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>swipe gestures to scroll through the different Home screens on your iPhone until you find the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app icon. Once you find the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app, you can start it by tapping the icon. Once the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> user interface appears, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> point your iPhone camera at text or any item you want to see, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.2</em>:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/></p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.2 – Using the Magnifier app&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.02_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Using the Magnifier app</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app consists of buttons and sliders. Tapping an icon performs an action, while swiping the slider left or right lets you increase or decrease a value, such as brightness or magnification<a id="_idTextAnchor084"/><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>. Let's begin:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To save space, only the zoom slider appears. If you want to display the brightness or contrast sliders, you'll need to tap the <strong class="bold">brightness</strong> or <strong class="bold">contrast</strong> icons, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.3</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 2.3 – The zoom, brightness, and contrast icons&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.03_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – The zoom, brightness, and contrast icons</p></li>
				<li>When you tap the <strong class="bold">brightness</strong> or <strong class="bold">contrast</strong> icons, a slider appears so that you can adjust either the <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>brightness or contrast. Swiping left and right on the slider changes that option, such as zoom, brightness, or contrast. </li>
				<li>When you no longer want to see<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> the brightness or contrast sliders, tap the <strong class="bold">brightness</strong> or <strong class="bold">contrast</strong> icons again. (Note that the zoom slider always remains visible by default.)</li>
				<li>If you tap the <strong class="bold">color filter</strong> icon, a list of different color filter options appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.4</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 2.4 – The color filter icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – The color filter icon</p></li>
				<li>To illuminate <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>an object, tap the <strong class="bold">flashlight</strong> icon, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.5</em>. This <strong class="bold">flashlight</strong> icon toggles<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> between turning the flash on or off to illuminate the area in front of your iPhone:<div><img alt="Figure 2.5 – The flashlight icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – The flashlight icon</p></li>
				<li>Most apps offer a <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>way to customize the app, so to do <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>that in the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app, tap the <strong class="bold">settings</strong> icon, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.6</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 2.6 – The settings icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – The settings icon</p></li>
				<li>Tapping the <strong class="bold">settings</strong> icon displays the <strong class="bold">Customize Controls</strong> screen, which displays options in a list. Two common features of lists are that they allow you to delete items or move items. </li>
				<li>To delete items, you can tap the <strong class="bold">delete</strong> icon, which looks like a white dash inside a red circle. </li>
				<li>To<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> move an item, you can swipe up or down on a three-line icon, often called a "hamburger menu" since<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> it looks like<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> the top and bottom of a bun with a patty inside, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.7</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.7 – The Customize Controls screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.07_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – The Customize Controls screen</p>
			<p>When you're done with the <strong class="bold">Customize Controls</strong> screen, tap the <strong class="bold">Done</strong> button in the upper-right corner of the screen. By experimenting with the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app, you can learn the basic gestures <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>and user interface elements, which can help you use nearly any app in no time. </p>
			<p>One unique feature of the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app is that it allows you to capture an image to view or share it with others. (However, note that when you capture a picture with the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app, that picture is <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>not saved but stored temporarily.) This lets you capture pictures and view them later at your convenience. The two buttons for capturing and viewing images are shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.8</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.8 – The capture view and view buttons&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.08_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – The capture view and view buttons</p>
			<p>Tapping the <strong class="bold">capture view</strong> button captures a picture of whatever you see through the iPhone camera. Once you've captured an image, you can view the captured image at your leisure without the need to hold your iPhone camera over a page anymore. The <strong class="bold">capture view</strong> button turns into a <strong class="bold">close</strong> button, so when you no longer want to view the static image you captured, click the <strong class="bold">close</strong> button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.9</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.9 – The capture view button turns into a close button&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.09_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – The capture view button turns into a close button</p>
			<p>Once you've captured an image, you<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> can tap the close button to dismiss that image. However, if you capture an image and want to temporarily save it, tap the <strong class="bold">View</strong> button instead. This turns the <strong class="bold">capture view</strong> button into a <strong class="bold">+</strong> button to<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> capture additional images, along with displaying the <strong class="bold">View</strong> button with the number of images temporarily stored, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.10</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.10 – The buttons change slightly when capturing multiple images&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.10_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10 – The buttons change slightly when capturing multiple images</p>
			<p>If you tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> button, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>capture additional images. If you tap the <strong class="bold">View</strong> button, you can view previously captured images. To dismiss a previously captured image, tap the <strong class="bold">End</strong> button in the upper-left corner.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app makes it easy to <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>either view images while holding your iPhone or to capture images that you can review later so that you don't have to hold your iPhone over a page.  </p>
			<p>Like most apps, the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app makes icons and buttons easy to spot. To see how another app works, let's take a look at the new <strong class="bold">Transl<a id="_idTextAnchor086"/><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>ate</strong> app.</p>
			<p>Using the Trans<a id="_idTextAnchor088"/><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>late app</p>
			<p>While some people<a id="_idIndexMarker083"/> may be multilingual, most<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> people know their native language well but may not feel comfortable speaking another language fluently. That's why Apple included a new <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app in iOS 14. The purpose of the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app is to let you either speak or type words in one language and see and hear a translation in another language.</p>
			<p>Currently, the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app can translate to and from the following languages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Arabic</li>
				<li>Chinese (Mandarin)</li>
				<li>English (US and UK)</li>
				<li>French</li>
				<li>German</li>
				<li>Italian</li>
				<li>Japanese</li>
				<li>Korean</li>
				<li>Portuguese</li>
				<li>Russian</li>
				<li>Spanish</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app appears <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.11</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.11 – The Translate app&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.11_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11 – The Translate app</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app displays two <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>different screens depending on whether you are holding your iPhone in portrait or landscape mode. Portrait mode is meant to let you either speak or type text to translate, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.12</em>: </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.12 – The Translate app in portrait mode&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.12_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.12 – The Translate app in portrait mode</p>
			<p>Landscape mode can translate a<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> conversation and let both people comfortably view the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figu<a id="_idTextAnchor090"/><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>re 2.13</em>:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.13 – The Translate app in landscape mode</p>
			<p>To define which languages you want the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app to use, hold the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app in portrait mode. Then, tap the two<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> language buttons at the top of the screen. When you <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>tap a language button, a list of supported languages appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.14</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.14 – Choosing a language in the Translate app&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.14_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.14 – Choosing a language in the Translate app</p>
			<p>Tap a<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> language to use, and then tap the <strong class="bold">Done</strong> button in the upper-right corner of the screen. By doing this for<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> both the input and output languages, you can translate between multiple languages. </p>
			<p>Once you've defined the two languages to use, you can now translate using either text or speech. To translate text:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Enter text</strong> box to make the virtual keyboard appear. </li>
				<li>Type your text and tap the <strong class="bold">Go</strong> button in the bottom-right corner of the virtual keyboard.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app displays your text, along with the translation in your chosen language, as shown in <em class="italic">Fi<a id="_idTextAnchor092"/><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>gure 2.15</em>:</li>

			<p>To translate <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>speech, tap the <strong class="bold">microphone</strong> button. The <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> screen displays an audio image, along<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> with text that says <strong class="bold">Listening…</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.16</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.16 – Capturing audio input&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.16_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.16 – Capturing audio input</p>
			<p>Speak the words you want to<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> be translated and then stop when you're done. After a few seconds, the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app will display the translated text as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.15</em>). The<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> Clear button lets you delete all text inside a text field with one tap. Whether you entered text by typing or through speech, you'll see three icons (<strong class="bold">favorites</strong>, <strong class="bold">dictionary</strong>, and <strong class="bold">play</strong>) under the translated text, as shown in <em class="italic">F<a id="_idTextAnchor100"/><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>igure 2.17</em>: </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.17 – The favorites, dictionary, and play icons&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.17_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.17 – The favorites, dictionary, and play icons</p>
			<p>Tapping the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> icon stores the translated text in the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> category, which you can view at any<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> time by tapping the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> icon in the bottom-right corner of <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> the screen. </p>
			<p>Tapping the <strong class="bold">dictionary</strong> icon displays the <strong class="bold">Dictionary</strong> pane. Now, you can tap on any word to view its dictionary definition, as shown in<a id="_idTextAnchor102"/><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/> <em class="italic">Figure 2.18</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.18 – The Dictionary pane lets you identify the meaning of each translated word&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.18_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.18 – The Dictionary pane lets you identify the meaning of each translated word</p>
			<p>When you no longer want to use the dictionary, tap the close icon (<strong class="bold">X</strong>) in the upper-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Dictionary</strong> pane.</p>
			<p>Tapping the <strong class="bold">play</strong> icon lets you hear <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>Siri speak the translated text out loud. This can be handy for<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> hearing the correct pronunciation of a translated sentence or for playing the translated text to another person.</p>
			<p>If you have stored any translations by tapping the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> icon, or if you want to view a list of your most recent translations, you can tap the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen. This opens the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> list as shown in<a id="_idTextAnchor104"/><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/> <em class="italic">Figure 2.19</em>: </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.19 – The favorites icon displays all translations marked as favorites plus recent translations&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.19_B14100.jpg"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.19 – The favorites icon displays all translations marked as favorites plus rec<a id="_idTextAnchor106"/><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>ent translations</p>
			<p>To unmark <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>a translation as <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>a favorite, simply tap on the translation and tap the <strong class="bold">favorites</strong> icon to toggle it off and on.</p>
			<p>Using the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app in portrait mode can be handy when you need translations for writing or reading. However, when you want to talk to someone who doesn't speak your language, it's easier to use the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app in landscape mode (see <em class="italic">Figure 2.13</em>):</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Hold your iPhone in <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>portrait orientation, then start the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app, and tap the language that you speak (in the upper-left corner of the screen). </li>
				<li>Tap the language that the <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>other person speaks (in the upper-right corner of the screen).</li>
				<li>Tilt your iPhone to landscape orientation. If necessary, tap the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> button at the bottom of the screen. The screen splits in half to display your spoken words and the translation, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.20</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 2.20 – Displaying text and its translation in landscape orientation&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.20_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.20 – Displaying text and its translation in landscape orientation</p></li>
				<li>Tap the button in the bottom-left corner that displays arrows pointing in opposite directions. This displays only your translated text to make it easy for someone to read it, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.21</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 2.21 – Displaying only translated text&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.21_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.21 – Displaying only translated text</p></li>
				<li>Tap the button in the<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> bottom-left corner of the screen (which contains two chat icons) to return back to viewing your original text and the translated text side by side. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>As an alternative to showing the translated text to <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>others, you can also tap the <strong class="bold">play</strong> button in the bottom-right corner so that Siri can speak the translated text out loud.</p>
			<p>By using the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app, you can communicate with others who may not speak your language. This can help you both get your thoughts across with a minimal amount of frustration, thanks to the iPhone. </p>
			<p>If you plan on using the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app often, you'll probably want to move it to a prominent location on your Home screen. For another way to find apps, consider using the <strong class="bold">App Library</strong>, another new feature in iOS 14.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31">U<a id="_idTextAnchor108"/><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>sing the App Library</h1>
			<p>While you can move and group <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>related app icons around the Home screen, most <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>people don't do that because it's time-consuming. As a result, it's far more common to store apps all over the Home screen and then have a hard time finding exactly which app you want at any given time.</p>
			<p>To reduce this problem, iOS 14 offers an <strong class="bold">App Library</strong>, which appears when you swipe left multiple times on the <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>Home screen. The number of left swipes you need<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> depends on the number of Home screens your iPhone has.</p>
			<p>The purpose of the <strong class="bold">App Library</strong> is to organize all your apps automatically into related groups with descriptive purposes, such as <strong class="bold">Social</strong>, <strong class="bold">Utilities</strong>, <strong class="bold">Productivity &amp; Finance</strong>, <strong class="bold">Travel</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Recently Added</strong>. In some cases, an app may appear in more than one category, such as the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app appearing in the <strong class="bold">Recently Added</strong> and <strong class="bold">Information &amp; Reading</strong> groups, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.22</em>:  </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.22 – The App Library&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.22_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.22 – The App Library</p>
			<p>By scrolling through the list of <strong class="bold">App Library</strong> categories, you can find and tap on the app you want to use, such as the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> or <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> apps. Since the <strong class="bold">App Library</strong> hides your least-used apps, you won't see all available apps in the <strong class="bold">App Library</strong>. </p>
			<p>If you want an <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>app that doesn't appear in the <strong class="bold">App Library</strong>, tap the <strong class="bold">App Library</strong> search field <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>at the top of the screen to display an alphabetical list of all the installed apps on your iPhone, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.23</em>: </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.23 – Tapping the App Library search field displays an alphabetical listing of all the installed apps&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.23_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.23 – Tapping the App Library search field displays an alphabetical listing of all the installed apps</p>
			<p>You can scroll through this alphabetical list of apps and then tap the app name you want to use. As a faster alternative, you can tap on the index that appears on the right. Tapping on an index lets you<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> jump to app names beginning with a certain letter, such as <strong class="bold">T</strong> or <strong class="bold">R</strong>. </p>
			<p>You can also type all or part of <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>an app name in the <strong class="bold">App Library</strong> search field. Each time you type another letter, the list of all matching apps narrows, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.24</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.24 – Typing part of an app name helps the App Library display a limited number of apps&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_2.24_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.24 – Typing part of an app name helps the App Library display a limited number of apps</p>
			<p>When you see the app you want to use, just tap on that app's icon. The <strong class="bold">App Library</strong> gives you both a visual and a textual way to find the app you want<a id="_idTextAnchor110"/> to use at any given time.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Three of the latest features in iOS 14 are the <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app, the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app, and the <strong class="bold">App Library</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Magnifier</strong> app can replace reading glasses or magnifying glasses to help you read small print or examine items closely.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app can help you communicate with someone who may not speak your language. As long as both you and the other person speak and read one of the languages supported by the <strong class="bold">Translate</strong> app (such as German, French, Arabic, Russian, or English), you'll be able to chat and write to each other in the language you're most comfortable writing or speaking.</p>
			<p>Finally, use the <strong class="bold">App Library</strong> to help you find an app you want to use. Over time, you gradually add apps faster than you remove them. The end result is that your Home screen winds up getting cluttered with lots of apps that you don't have the time to organize. That's when you can rely on the <strong class="bold">App Library</strong> to organize apps for you automatically or help you find an app by searching for it by name. </p>
			<p>For many people, when they get an iPhone, their first task is to customize it by changing background images or choosing different ringtones, and that's what you'll learn how to do in the next chapter. </p>
