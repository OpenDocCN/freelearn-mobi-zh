<p>Unity has come a long way from its humble beginnings; however, since the last couple of years, it has almost become an industry-wide used tool that almost all independent game developers use to develop their games. It is very easy to use to develop prototypes, and when you have a successful idea, it is flexible enough to expand the small prototype to a full-fledged game.</p>
<p>Despite its professional capacity, Unity is so simple to use that even a complete novice person can develop a basic game within a matter of hours. And with a little more effort, a very polished game can be developed with excellent lighting and animation.</p>
<p>With the current version, Unity makes game development even more accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>In this book, we will cover a variety of topics both in 2D and 3D game development. We will see how to develop a game similar to JetPack Joyride in 2D, and a 3D fighting game with full 3D animation, lighting, and camera. We will also see how to add buttons, text, and screen transitions. Finally, once we have created the game, we will see how to monetize it by adding in-app purchases and ads.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">What you need for this book</h1>
            

            
                
<p>You will need the latest version of Unity, which you can download from their website, and a computer that can run Unity. A basic understanding of C# is required as the code in this book is written in C#. Although the game can run on an Android emulator, to see the actual performance of the game, an Android device would be required.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Who this book is for</h1>
            

            
                
<p>This book is geared toward novice or intermediate Unity3D developers who want to expand their knowledge of Unity3D and create high-end, complex Android games. You are expected to have a basic or intermediate understanding of Unity3D, working with its environment, basic concepts such as Game Objects and Prefabs, Unity Scripting using<br/>
C# or JavaScript, and how to develop basic 2D/3D games using Unity3D.</p>
<p>The book is very useful for those Unity developers who have created basic/simple games for Android and want to learn the ins and outs and core components of high-end complex games that have features such as detailed animations, multiple levels, character abilities, enemy weaknesses, intelligent AI, achievements, leaderboards, and a lot more.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Conventions</h1>
            

            
                
<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The<br/>
<kbd>bIsDefending</kbd> variable is the same as that we defined as a parameter in Animation Controller."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>
    private Animator anim;<br/>    // Use this for initialization<br/>    <br/>    void Start () {<br/>        anim = GetComponent&lt;Animator&gt;();<br/>    } // start
</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>
    if (pAnim.GetBool("tIsPunching")){<br/>        if (anim.GetBool("bEnemyIsDefending") == false) {<br/>            Debug.Log("enemy got hit");<br/>            anim.SetTrigger("tEnemyGotHit");<br/>            anim.SetBool("bEnemyIsDefending", true);<br/><strong>            health -= pScript.damage;</strong><br/>        }<br/>    }
</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>
<strong>C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Unity.exe</strong>
</pre>
<p>New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Unity lets developers manage these components of each game object through the Inspector panel."</p>
<div><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p>
</div>
<div><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
</div>
