- en: In order to develop a great app, you need to take your UI design seriously.
    Even if your app delivers great functionality, if its user interface is clunky,
    laggy, difficult to navigate, or just an all-around eyesore, then no one is going
    to want to use it.

    process, you can create a UI that delivers a great experience across the *entire*
    Android ecosystem.
