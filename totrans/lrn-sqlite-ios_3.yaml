- en: In this chapter, we are going to introduce you to administering the **SQLite**
    database and make you aware of the different components of this relational database
    system that best suits the mobile or tablet devices. SQLite is an embedded SQL
    engine and simply reads and writes to ordinary disk files instead of having a
    separate server process. It was designed for this purpose and is much easier to
    maintain and look after.

  zh: 在本章中，我们将向您介绍 SQLite 数据库的管理，并让您了解这个关系型数据库系统的不同组件，这些组件最适合移动或平板设备。SQLite 是一个嵌入式
    SQL 引擎，它简单地读取和写入普通磁盘文件，而不是有一个单独的服务器进程。它是为此目的而设计的，并且维护起来更容易。
