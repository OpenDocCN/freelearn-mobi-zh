    best performance in a virtualization environment, you may want to explore various
    GPU virtualization technologies, such as GPU passthrough, GPU sharing, GPU software

    graphic cards. VESA BIOS extensions provide the primary functionality of VESA
    standard through the BIOS interface. On Linux, uvesafb needs a user space daemon
    called `v86d` as a backend for kernel drivers that need to execute x86 BIOS code.
    Since BIOS code can only be executed in a controlled environment, the code executed
    by `v86d` can be run either in a fully software-emulated environment or a virtualized
    environment supported by the CPU. The `v86d` has been ported to Android by the
    Android-x86 project. It can be found at `$AOSP/external/v86d`. Since the `v86d`
    project needs additional system calls such as `ioperm` and `iopl`, the Android-x86

- en: VirtualBox is a virtualization environment. We can install a guest operating
    system as it is in VirtualBox. However, there are some limitations to working
    in this way. To run a guest operating system in a host environment, you may expect
    more things than just hardware virtualization. For example, you may find the mouse
    cursor to behave badly when you move between the host and guest system. You may
    want to share data between the hosts and guests easily, such as shared clipboard,
    shared folder, and so on. To meet these requirements, the host and guest need
    to know each other and have a way to talk to each other. In VirtualBox architecture,
    there is a component called **Host-Guest Communication Manager** (**HGCM**). On
    the host side, VirtualBox implements a service called HGCM service that can serve
    the requests from the guest. On the guest side, there are a few kernel drivers
    from VirtualBox that can be used to communicate to the host.
