- en: Since the introduction of iOS 8 in 2014, game development for the iOS platform
    has gone through some major changes. The first of those changes was the introduction
    of the Swift programming language, a functional programming language made by Apple
    to be simple to code and modern in its capabilities, all while being fast enough
    to handle modern app and game development. iOS 8 also introduced the 3D game development
    framework, SceneKit. SceneKit allowed developers to quickly design 3D games and
    work with 3D assets in a similar fashion to iOS 7's SpriteKit. A year later, in
    the summer of 2015, iOS 9 was introduced, along with a new set of tools for both
    seasoned and brand new iOS game developers. The new framework, GameplayKit, lets
    developers handle the game rules, AI, game entities, and game states separately
    from the inheritance logic. In addition to GameplayKit, Apple showed off the Fox
    game example that displays how Xcode can now do much of the same visual editing
    functionalities seen in multiplatform game engines, such as Unity and Unreal Engine.

- en: We will first become familiar with the Swift programming language and how it
    can be used in the scope of game development. The goal is to understand iOS game
    development from the ground up, learning the tougher code-centric methodology
    of making a game. In addition to taking a look at Apple's own example projects
    for the various iOS game frameworks, we will see some code examples from two games,
    the first game being a published Swift-developed 2D scrolling game named PikiPop
    and the other being a tile-based Minesweeper clone named SwiftSweeper. As we progress
    through the book, we will still keep code as the core of our method for game development,
    but will look into the visual tools introduced in iOS 9 that, in addition to GameplayKit
    and the component-based structuring, can allow us to create a game that is only
    limited by our imagination. We then dive into topic of the low-level APIs, such
    as OpenGL ES and Metal, for developers who wish to get down directly to the GPU.

- en: In the end, we hope that you understand how iOS continues to be a power game
    development platform, whether you are a developer who comes from the traditional
    code-centric school of computer science, or you are a part of the growing visual-based/drag-and-drop
    design paradigm. Our goal is that when you are finished with this book, you will
    have a number of vastly different and detailed game ideas, which you then can
    immediately begin building with Swift and the iOS 9 platforms.
