    might be a doctor's appointment, a job interview, a train or plane trip, or just
    meeting a friend for drinks or lunch. Since nearly everyone needs to keep track
    of their schedule, you might as well use your iPhone to help you keep track of
    various appointments you need to keep at certain times and dates in the future.

    important. Even better, you can set reminders so your iPhone can beep to let you
    know in advance when an appointment is coming up. That way you can prepare in
