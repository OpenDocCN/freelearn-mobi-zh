- en: Last year, Apple delivered a great talk on the benefits of using value types
    and protocol-oriented design patterns in our code. This year with Swift 3, the
    team at Apple added value types to the Foundation framework. Many of our favorite
    and heavily used classes now have value type equivalents. We will cover how to
    use Foundation value types throughout this chapter and have you wondering why
    value types weren't included with Swift from the beginning!

    API [https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsmeasurement](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsmeasurement)
    addresses pain points that have been with Objective-C and Swift developers for
    a long time. Apple has created an extremely well thought out solution to our problems.
    We will use several examples to hammer in the concepts so that you will leave
    this chapter better prepared to handle your measurement challenges in the future.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the key concepts of the Swift language is to give developers the ability
    to control the mutability of their objects. We use `let` to make a value a constant
    and `var` to make the value a variable. However, certain types, when imported
    from Objective-C, do not provide easy mutability features. Swift 3 aims to change
    this by adding a new set of Foundation value types to wrap reference types in
    order to provide mutable options for developers. In fact, this really isn't all
    that new as Foundation already uses many value types in both Objective-C and Swift.
    Foundation has existing types such as primitives, Enumerations, Option sets, and
    C structure types that already were value types in previous versions of Swift
    and Objective-C.

- en: To make the conversion from reference type to value type possible, Swift uses
    the *copy-on-write* technique for new value types whose underlying data contains
    more than just simple data. With *copy-on-write*, the value type represents a
    pointer to shared data and only makes a copy of the data, if there is a request
    to change the data by one of the references to it. The following table lists the
    new value types added to the Foundation framework.

- en: These new value types work just like their counterparts, with the added value
    that you can control the mutability in a more transparent way. Some of the new
    value types are implemented as structure types and will have one or more mutating
    methods exposed. The good news is that the new Foundation value types will have
    no impact on existing Objective-C code. However, there will be an impact on the
    Swift side. Any existing Swift code migrated to Swift 3 that uses reference types
    will shift to call the new value types. While the migrator will do much of the
    heavy lifting, you will still have opportunities to further enhance your code
    use. This is because the migrator utilizes a strategy of making the minimum number
    of changes possible. As an example, the migrator will not attempt to change any
    Swift subclasses for reference types.

    change its value without affecting the value of `avg1`. Reference types, on the
    other hand, share content by default. Changing one of the variables will change
    the underlying value that each reference shares.

    our first value to it. Since both variables share their underlying data, modifying
    either variable changes both values.

    feature. This feature allows the migrator to import related Objective-C enumerations
    into Swift under a common type. For example, the `NSDateFormatterStyle` and `NSDateFormatterBehavior`
    enumerations are imported as nested enumerations to the `DateFormatter` class
    in Swift. Let's see how we get to a nested enumeration in Swift 3, starting with
    an Objective-C enumeration.

    I would like to know some of the attributes of the file, which I can get by passing
    an array of strings to the `resourceValuesForKeys` method of my file reference.
    I can read the values using subscript notation and even update the values. Further,
    I can write the new values back to file with the `setResourceValues` method. The
    problem we experience is subtle and not shown until we execute this block of code.
    The `NSURLCreationDateKey` expects its value to be a valid `NSDate`.

    error as we attempt to update our file with the new resource values. What we want
    is a way to check our constraints at compile time. Swift 3 now gives us a way
    to do this, and the Foundation framework has been updated to reflect this new
    feature. Let's update our example to reflect using type safe access to our file

    the APIs they updated to provide us better type constraints.

    measurements easier for developers. By allowing developers to create measurements

    to convert to another type. We also gain validation that we aren't mixing measurement
    values that don't work together. It would not necessarily make sense to add a
    length unit to one that stores a volume. Without the measurement's API, you would
    have to write your own methods to ensure the proper constraints held true.
