Each iAd begins as a small exciting banner on a user's personal device that once activated bursts to fill the screen, giving you, the advertiser, a chance to craft a deeply immersive experience.<a class="indexterm" id="id0"/>
</p><p>Application developers on the Apple App Store designate space within their app for your iAd to be shown, with the banner sitting at the bottom of the screen throughout the use of the app. Often, iAds can be more interesting than the app they're in!</p><p>iAds are built into iOS 4.0 and, later, the operating system used by the Apple iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>Think of an iAd as a mini-app contained within another third-party application that a user has downloaded from the Apple App Store.</p></div><p>With an iAd, your advertisement is viewed by an audience that:<a class="indexterm" id="id1"/>

However, mobile advertising is often a jarring and unpleasant experience for the user. Unhappy with this, Apple decided to build a unique advertising platform right into the handsets of millions of users.</p><p>In early 2011, Apple announced iAd support for iPad, which gives us full access to a rich interactive multi-touch canvas to promote our brands or products in a way that was previously only imaginable to advertisers.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>Many companies using iAds create a promotional video just to show off their ad!

This still delivers iAd's to the user, but without any user-specific targeting. Obviously, Apple doesn't publicize this and only a handful of power users ever opt-out.</p></div><div class="section" title="Understanding problems with existing mobile advertising"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec01"/>Understanding problems with existing mobile advertising</h2></div></div></div><p>Mobile advertising isn't a new idea but, until iAd, it was never quite right. It was filled with ringtones, wallpapers, and premium SMS that would unwittingly sign the user up to a subscription service. It was more about publicizing paid mobile media direct to the customer than promoting great brands and products.<a class="indexterm" id="id9"/>
</p><p>In-application advertising is beginning to target more specific brands, but nearly all mobile adverts take you out of the application you're currently in and make it impossible to easily get back to where you just were. Typically, the user is pushed out of the app into the mobile browser, to a webpage that often isn't meant for mobile and lacks interaction and responsiveness for the user. Before iAd, a typical mobile banner would be a plain static strip hidden within a user's app, not an interactive ad built into the core operating system.</p><p>On the desktop, most advertising revenue comes from search, but mobile users are using more specific apps for finding the information they want. If you want to find a great place to eat, you're more likely to open up a restaurant directory app than go into the mobile browser and use a search engine. Context-aware applications are becoming the way users find things on mobile. Your iAd intelligently positions itself in these applications, providing relevant, contextual, and exciting marketing opportunities.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Discovering what makes an iAd awesome"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec02"/>Discovering what makes an iAd awesome</h1></div></div></div><p>Unlike traditional mobile advertising, each iAd provides an in-app interactive advertisement, which doesn't push the user out of the app. Never before have you been able to promote your brand or product with such an immersive experience, interacting with the fingertips of the users.<a class="indexterm" id="id10"/>
</p><p>A study by Nielsen compared Campbell's Soup TV advertising campaign with their iAd mobile advertisement and found that users interacting with the iAd were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">More than twice as likely to recall the ad</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Three times more likely to remember the messaging</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Four times more likely to purchase</li></ul></div><p>People remember better when there's interactivity with the information that we want them to absorb. Each iAd is given access to deeply immersive device features, from the full multi-touch screen (allowing users to pinch and flick around images of your really cool product close up) to physical movements of the device (allowing them to use a shake to show a random message or fact about your brand), iAds offer an unparalleled opportunity for a compelling, interactive, and memorable experience.</p><p>The unique features integrated in an iAd make it possible to let users interact with your brand in several engaging ways, such as the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Download an app or buy iTunes media from within an iAd:</strong></span> If you have content available on the iTunes Store or App Store, such as a movie or app that you want to promote, users can purchase this within your iAd with a single tap, without ever leaving the app they're in</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Save screen images to photo albums:</strong></span> Images like coupons, barcodes, recipes, or branded wallpaper can be saved straight to the user's device or instantly set as their background</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>View in-line audio and video:</strong></span> Video can be played within a custom frame in your iAd, overlaid with interactive elements interactive elements</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Find nearby stores:</strong></span> With rich Google Maps built into every iOS device, it's easy to show a list of your nearby stores or retailers</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Share content through Twitter without leaving the ad:</strong></span> The iAd framework is completely extensible, so social sharing and almost any functionality can be achieved</li></ul></div><p>At any time, the user can click on the close button, always in the top-left of an iAd, and get back to the app that they were in, which makes them more comfortable about tapping on an iAd and associates your brand with a positive experience. Here, you can see the close button in a demo ad:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Discovering what makes an iAd awesome" src="graphics/1321_01_01.jpg"/></div><p>With iAd, Apple has built an experience that simultaneously combines the interactivity of traditional online advertising with the emotive aspects of television advertising.<a class="indexterm" id="id11"/>

<div class="section" title="Describing the anatomy of an iAd"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec03"/>Describing the anatomy of an iAd</h1></div></div></div><p>An iAd consists of four key parts, which are as follows:<a class="indexterm" id="id12"/>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">A banner ad.</li><li class="listitem">Transition from the banner to the main advert.</li><li class="listitem">A splash page.</li><li class="listitem">The core ad unit.</li></ol></div><div class="section" title="Understanding the banner's role"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec02"/>Understanding the banner's role</h2></div></div></div><p>The<span class="strong"><strong> banner</strong></span> is the first impression of your advert; it's vital that it inspires the user to tap on it and explore all the other great content you've got waiting in your iAd. Banners are identifiable by their small logo in the bottom-right of the banner, as shown in the following screenshot:<a class="indexterm" id="id13"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Understanding the banner's role" src="graphics/1321_01_02.jpg"/></div><p>The iAd logo increases the chance of the user tapping on your advert, as they know they'll be delivered a rich immersive ad without losing the place of the app they're in.</p><p>The banner is typically displayed either at the bottom of the screen or above the tab bar of a user's application, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Understanding the banner's role" src="graphics/1321_01_03.jpg"/></div><div class="section" title="Using different banner types"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>Using different banner types</h3></div></div></div><p>There are two types of banners you can use for your iAd - a<span class="strong"><strong> static image banner</strong></span> or a<span class="strong"><strong> dynamic HTML5 banner</strong></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id14"/>
</p><div class="section" title="Static image banner"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl4sec01"/>Static image banner</h4></div></div></div><p>A static image banner is a much more traditional banner and is often chosen because it's quick and simple to create.<a class="indexterm" id="id15"/>
</p><p>Your static banner can either be the size of the banner frame or can be a screen-size static banner with only a slice of the image visible in the banner, revealing the full image when the user taps to view your ad.</p></div><div class="section" title="Dynamic HTML5 banner"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl4sec02"/>Dynamic HTML5 banner</h4></div></div></div><p>An HTML5 dynamic banner opens up much more opportunity for user engagement, as it allows for animated text and graphics. Adding motion and animation to your banner makes it stand out on the user's device, drawing their attention to your ad and increasing the chance they'll tap to find out more about your brand.<a class="indexterm" id="id16"/>
</p><p>With an HTML5 banner you're able to update data in the banner remotely with real-time information, like latest sports scores or stock quotes.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Transitioning into the ad"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec03"/>Transitioning into the ad</h2></div></div></div><p>The transition occurs when the user taps the banner to enter your iAd; it softens the entry to the splash page and creates a visual connection between the two. The transition can either be a<span class="strong"><strong> slide</strong></span> or a<span class="strong"><strong> reveal</strong></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id17"/>
</p><div class="section" title="Slide transition"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec02"/>Slide transition</h3></div></div></div><p>The slide transition is the most common way of presenting your splash page. It pushes a full color block up from your banner covering the app the user is currently in. A progress bar shows the status of the loading of your splash screen.<a class="indexterm" id="id18"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Reveal transition"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec03"/>Reveal transition</h3></div></div></div><p>You should only use reveal transition if you're using a screen-size static banner. It pushes apart the user interface elements in the users app to reveal your iAd splash screen. The following screenshot shows the reveal transition in an ad that we'll create later in the book:<a class="indexterm" id="id19"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Reveal transition" src="graphics/1321_01_04.jpg"/></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Making loading interesting with the splash page"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec04"/>Making loading interesting with the splash page</h2></div></div></div><p>The splash page is an optional screen; it is shown while the main iAd resources load, in between the user's tapping of your banner and their being able to interact with the core ad unit.<a class="indexterm" id="id20"/>
</p><p>Although the splash page is optional, it's an ideal opportunity to convey your brand message while the resources for your ad load.<a class="indexterm" id="id21"/>
</p><p>Apple estimates you've got 15 seconds to win the user's attention once they've entered your iAd, so an engaging splash page ensures that we keep them happy while they wait.</p><p>The splash page can be used to show interesting stats or features about your brand or product before transitioning into the main ad.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"/>Note</h3><p>Even if you think your iAd is lightweight and won't need time to download, users are often on slow mobile data connections where small ads won't load immediately.</p></div><p>A pre-roll video can also be used in the splash page although, with the lightweight CSS3 animations and styles available, we can apply dynamic effects to images and text that can often mimic video, without the large (and slow) download associated with streaming video.</p></div><div class="section" title="Exploring the core ad unit"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec05"/>Exploring the core ad unit</h2></div></div></div><p>This is the main part of your iAd where there is a real opportunity to deliver your content in a range of exciting ways. The core ad unit is built up of multiple views; think of these as different pages of a website, each with a range of media and content to excite the user about your brand or product.<a class="indexterm" id="id22"/>
</p><p>The ad unit starts with the<span class="strong"><strong> root view</strong></span>, which is generally used for navigation, to toggle between the different views within your iAd.<a class="indexterm" id="id23"/>
</p><p>The subpages of the root view offer the chance to provide: dynamic maps showing the location of the user to your nearest store or retailer, amazing 3D interactive video carousels and image galleries, or a blank canvas only limited by your own imagination! Here is a selection of the templates that can be used in your iAd to give you an understanding of the types of the content you can include:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Exploring the core ad unit" src="graphics/1321_01_05.jpg"/></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Understanding your iAd"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec04"/>Understanding your iAd</h1></div></div></div><p>An iAd is essentially a rich dynamic webpage contained within an application a user has installed. For the most part, we don't need to be concerned with what's going on, as the tools Apple provides manage this for us. That having been said, it is good to have an understanding of the magic that powers your iAd.<a class="indexterm" id="id24"/>
</p><p>HTML5 is the underlying technology of the iAd framework. It is based on the future of the web with the next generation of HTML (and mistakenly marketed as including enhancements to JavaScript and CSS). Our iAds can use HTML5 in conjunction with many of the latest features in JavaScript and CSS.</p><div class="section" title="Structuring with HTML"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec06"/>Structuring with HTML</h2></div></div></div><p>HTML5, the fifth generation of<span class="strong"><strong> HTML</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>(Hypertext Markup Language)</strong></span>, is the content and semantic structure of your page.<a class="indexterm" id="id25"/>
</p><p>Video, audio, and other things that traditionally would require a plug-in, such as Flash (which iOS famously doesn't support), can now be done with HTML5.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"/>Note</h3><p>For those curious, if you right-click on a webpage and choose<span class="strong"><strong> View Source</strong></span>, you can look at the underlying HTML that creates the structure and contains the content of that page.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Styling with CSS3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>Styling with CSS3</h2></div></div></div><p>The third revision of<span class="strong"><strong> CSS</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong> (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong></span> allows visual styling in your iAd. With CSS3, styling of rounded corners and background gradients can be done without images, which means that your iAd is lightweight and delivers your brand message much faster to the user. CSS3 has rich animation capacity, which can bring life to your iAd and banner.<a class="indexterm" id="id26"/>
</p><p>CSS3 has smooth, hardware-accelerated 3D effects that you can apply to your iAd assets, combined with animations. Rich 3D motion adds to the interactivity of your ad.</p></div><div class="section" title="Interacting with JavaScript"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Interacting with JavaScript</h2></div></div></div><p>JavaScript is a programming language used to control the interactivity inside your iAd. Whenever tapping or pinching somewhere causes interaction with your iAd, behind the scenes, JavaScript will be controlling this. JavaScript is able to access user location to find local stores and provide location-sensitive promotions. JavaScript can be used to remotely fetch the latest offers and information from your website, using a technology called AJAX to create a dynamic, up-to-date experience.<a class="indexterm" id="id27"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Arranging the files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>Arranging the files</h2></div></div></div><p>Each iAd is a folder full of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media used for your banner and ad unit. In the following screenshot, we can see the file structure of a typical iAd:<a class="indexterm" id="id28"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Arranging the files" src="graphics/1321_01_06.jpg"/></div><p>If you wanted to, you could create an entire iAd using just a text editor to manipulate these files.

You now know that an iAd is an exciting marketing opportunity on Apple iOS devices, the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. iAds stand out because they offer an unparalleled interactive experience. Each iAd is a tiny interactive webpage, using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. An iAd has four key parts:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong> A Banner:</strong></span> The engaging opportunity for users to tap on your iAd.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong> A Transition:</strong></span> A non-jarring animation between your banner and splash page.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong> A Splash page:</strong></span> Makes waiting fun for the user and keeps their attention.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong> The Core Ad Unit:</strong></span> The navigation and subpages that make up the key opportunities to impress the user.</li></ol></div><p>iAd Producer is the tool that we'll be using to build your iAd.
