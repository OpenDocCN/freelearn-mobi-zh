    faced during game programming in iOS devices. This book covers a wide range of
    topics with detail and practical explanations. This book serves starts with simple
    game animations and an introduction to SpriteKit and then will grow the horizon
    towards working with the physics engine, 3D game programming, Artificial Intelligence
    for games and finally we will end up learning multiplayer game programming.
