    them in our Android projects. We learned about creating Kotlin Flows with Flow
    builders. We then explored Flow operators and how to use them with Kotlin Flows.

    Cancelations and Exceptions*, we learned about canceling coroutines and that coroutine
    cancellation must be cooperative. As Kotlin Flows are built on top of coroutines,
    Flow follows the cooperative cancellation of coroutines.

    call to send new values to the Flow also calls `ensureActive` internally. This

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When performing long-running tasks, such as a network call, sometimes it is
    necessary to try the call again. This includes cases such as logging in/out, posting
    data, or even fetching data. The user may be in an area with a low internet connection,
    or there may be other factors why the call is failing. With Kotlin Flows, we have
    the `retry` and `retryWhen` operators that we can use to retry Flows automatically.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `retry` operator allows you to set a `retries` as the maximum number of
    times the Flow will retry. You can also set a `predicate` condition, a code block
    that will retry the Flow when it returns `true`. The predicate has a **Throwable**
    parameter representing the exception that occurred; you can use that to check
    whether you want to do the retry or not.

- en: This chapter focused on Kotlin Flow cancelations. You learned that Flows follow
    the cooperative cancellation of coroutines. The `flow{}` builder and `StateFlow`
    and `SharedFlow` implementations are cancellable by default. You can use the `cancellable`
    operator to make other Flows cancellable.

    and `retryWhen` functions to retry the Flow based on the number of attempts and
    the exception encountered by the Flow.

- en: Then, we learned about handling exceptions that can happen during the emission
    or collection of data in a Flow. You can use the `try-catch` block or the `catch`
    Flow operator to handle Flow exceptions.

- en: We learned how to handle Flow completion. With the `onStart` and `onCompletion`
    operators, you can listen and run code when Flows start and when they have finished.
    You can also emit values with the `onStart` and `onCompletion` code blocks, such
    as when you want to set an initial and final value for the Flow.

    exceptions that can be encountered in a Flow. We used the `catch` Flow operator
    to handle exceptions in the project.
