- en: The more we do storyboard work, the easier it gets. I remember that when I started
    Xcode, it was a bit overwhelming because of all the panels and it really took
    me time to get comfortable. Anytime I speak with someone looking to get into iOS,
    I always tell them to dedicate at least 10-15 minutes a day to it for the first
    six months. It seems like a lot, but it really makes a difference when you are
    trying to learn. If you step away for a week and try to come back, it is like
    starting from ground zero; at least, it was for me. When I finally started to
    catch on was when I was in Xcode everyday and was relentless.

    to a detail. Next, we added a button in our details, which allows us to see restaurant
    reviews. Lastly, we added a map to our Map tab.

    point. Starting from when we created the project towards the end of [Chapter 6](75201e71-726f-4ab1-8d45-bb84774b10e6.xhtml),
    *Starting the UI Setup*, in the *Creating a new project* section. See if you can
    go from that point to here without the book and without missing anything. This
    will really help you and it is something I like to do with those I mentor.
