			<p>Kotlin is a programming language created by JetBrains that runs on the <strong class="bold">Java Virtual Machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">JVM</strong>). It was designed to address issues such as verbosity, null pointer exceptions, concurrency challenges, and the lack of functional support found in Java. Kotlin offers a more modern and concise programming approach while still being compatible with existing Java code and libraries. Google recognized Kotlin as a primary language for building Android apps, leading to significant efforts to support developers. This book adopts an industry-focused approach, preparing you for the role of an Android developer in any company. It follows current best practices recommended by Google’s Android team, providing insights based on practical experience.</p>
			<p>With practical examples, the book guides you through developing Android apps using Kotlin, imparting hands-on knowledge that is essential for becoming a proficient Android developer. Topics include building apps with Jetpack Compose, incorporating Material Design 3 for a personalized touch, and structuring apps in the MVVM architecture. The guide further demonstrates how to enhance your app’s architecture with features such as dependency injection, use Jetpack Libraries such as Room for local data persistence, and implement debugging techniques. It covers testing, identifying code issues using tools such as Ktlint and Detekt, and guides you through the publication process on Google Play Store. Automation of consecutive releases through GitHub Actions and the distribution of test builds using Firebase App Distribution are also explored. Additionally, the book addresses app improvement strategies, including crash reporting tools, tips for boosting user engagement, and insights on securing your app.</p>
