			<p>If you've ever traveled by plane or train, you've probably taken a book with you. The problem with printed books is that they're bulky, which means you can only take a handful at the most before they become unwieldy. Even worse, it's far too easy to forget or misplace a book – and then be stuck without it. </p>
			<p>Fortunately, you can turn your iPhone into an eBook reader. Not only can you carry hundreds or even thousands of books to read wherever you take your iPhone, but you can read any time you get a chance, such as waiting in line or traveling on a plane or train. </p>
			<p>With eBooks, you literally have access to any book in the world that you can read at your convenience from your iPhone. If you prefer to read without looking at text, you can also buy and listen to audiobooks as well. </p>
			<p>The topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Getting eBooks from Apple's bookstore</li>
				<li>Adding eBooks to the Books app</li>
				<li>Opening an eBook</li>
				<li>Reading an eBook </li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor467"/><a id="_idTextAnchor468"/><a id="_idTextAnchor469"/><a id="_idTextAnchor470"/>Getting eBooks from Apple's bookstore</h1>
			<p>There are two ways to <a id="_idIndexMarker712"/>put eBooks on your iPhone. First, you<a id="_idIndexMarker713"/> can buy them from Apple's bookstore. When you get eBooks from Apple, those eBooks can be free or cost money. </p>
			<p>A second option is to get eBooks from another source and then copy those files into the Books app so you can read them on your iPhone. Two popular types of eBook file formats are <strong class="bold">PDF</strong> (<strong class="bold">Portable Digital Format</strong>) and <strong class="bold">EPUB</strong> (<strong class="bold">Electronic Publication</strong>) files that you can either buy or get for free from various third parties on the internet. </p>
			<p>Generally speaking, you will need to pay for eBooks such as the latest bestsellers from your favorite authors. However, you <a id="_idIndexMarker714"/>can find many free eBooks containing classics such as writings by Mark Twain, Jane Austen, or Charles Dickens. You may also find free eBooks containing useful information that individuals or corporations<a id="_idIndexMarker715"/> provide to market their services or products. </p>
			<p>First, let's take a look at how to buy eBooks through Apple's bookstore. To access Apple's bookstore, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Book Store</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. The <strong class="bold">Book Store</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.1</em>. (If you want an audio book, tap the <strong class="bold">Audiobooks</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen instead.):<a id="_idTextAnchor471"/><a id="_idTextAnchor472"/><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer323"><img alt="Figure 12.1 – The Book Store screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.1 – The Book Store screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap on <strong class="bold">Browse Sections</strong>. A list <a id="_idIndexMarker716"/>of options will appear, as<a id="_idIndexMarker717"/> shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.2</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer324"><img alt="Figure 12.2 – The Book Store screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.2 – The Book Store screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap a category <a id="_idIndexMarker718"/>and tap a book that you'd like on <a id="_idIndexMarker719"/>your iPhone. <p>A description of the eBook appears along with a <strong class="bold">BUY</strong> button (that lists the price), a <strong class="bold">WANT TO READ</strong> button, and a <strong class="bold">SAMPLE</strong> button that lets you read a part of the book, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.3</em>. If an eBook is free, a <strong class="bold">GET</strong> button will appear instead of a <strong class="bold">BUY</strong> button:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer325"><img alt="Figure 12.3 – Viewing a single book&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.03_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.3 – Viewing a single book</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">BUY</strong> button <a id="_idIndexMarker720"/>to purchase the eBook or tap the <strong class="bold">Sample</strong> button to read part of the book.</li>
				<li>Tap the close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon in the<a id="_idIndexMarker721"/> upper-right corner of the screen to return to the list of books. You may need to repetitively tap the <strong class="bold">Back</strong> button in the upper-left corner of the screen to see previous screens.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When browsing eBooks, you have the option of tapping a <strong class="bold">WANT TO READ</strong> button (see <em class="italic">Figure 12.3</em>). This lets you save a list of eBooks you're interested in so that you don't have to search for it again later. </p>
			<p>Once you tap the <strong class="bold">WANT TO READ</strong> button, your <a id="_idIndexMarker722"/>selected eBook gets stored in the <strong class="bold">WANT TO READ</strong> collection. To browse through this list of eBooks that <a id="_idIndexMarker723"/>you selected by tapping the <strong class="bold">WANT TO READ</strong> button, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Books</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. The <strong class="bold">Library</strong> screen appears, which shows a list of eBooks stored in your collections, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.4</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer326"><img alt="Figure 12.4 – The Library screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.4 – The Library screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Collections</strong> to view all the<a id="_idIndexMarker724"/> different categories<a id="_idIndexMarker725"/> available, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.5</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer327"><img alt="Figure 12.5 – The Collections screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.5 – The Collections screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Want to Read</strong>. A list of eBook <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>samples appears. </li>
				<li>Tap on the eBook you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker727"/>examine.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen when you want to remove an eBook from your <strong class="bold">Want to Read</strong> collection. </li>
				<li>Tap the circle that appears to the left of each eBook you want to remove from your <strong class="bold">Want to Read</strong> collection.</li>
				<li>Tap the Trash icon in the <a id="_idIndexMarker728"/>bottom-left corner of the screen. A list of options appears at the bottom of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Remove from Want to Read</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Going through Apple's bookstore is<a id="_idIndexMarker729"/> the easiest and most convenient way to find eBooks. However, you can find and buy eBooks from third parties on th<a id="_idTextAnchor473"/><a id="_idTextAnchor474"/>e internet. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor475"/>Adding eBooks to the Books app</h1>
			<p>Many companies offer eBooks<a id="_idIndexMarker730"/> stored as PDF files that you can download off websites or receive when you sign up for a mailing list. Other eBook sellers may sell eBooks stored in PDF or ePub format. </p>
			<p>If you have existing eBooks, you<a id="_idIndexMarker731"/> may want to read them on your iPhone using the Books app. That means you'll need to add the eBook to the Books app. If you have an eBook on a Macintosh or iPhone/iPad, you can send that eBook to your iPhone using AirDrop.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor476"/>Adding eBooks from a Macintosh </h2>
			<p>AirDrop works between an iPhone<a id="_idIndexMarker732"/> and another Apple product such as<a id="_idIndexMarker733"/> another iPhone, iPad, or Macintosh computer. The basic step is to send an eBook file to your iPhone and then load that eBook file into the Books app.</p>
			<p>To send an eBook by AirDrop from a Macintosh, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Unlock your iPhone and place it near the Macintosh that contains the eBook file you want to send.</li>
				<li>Click the Finder icon on the Macintosh and then choose <strong class="bold">Go</strong> | <strong class="bold">AirDrop</strong>. The <strong class="bold">AirDrop</strong> window appears and displays your iPhone's icon, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.6</em>: <div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer328"><img alt="Figure 12.6 – The AirDrop window on a Macintosh&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.6 – The AirDrop window<a id="_idTextAnchor477"/><a id="_idTextAnchor478"/> on a Macintosh</p></li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Finder Window</strong> from<a id="_idIndexMarker734"/> the <strong class="bold">Finder</strong> menu <a id="_idIndexMarker735"/>and drag the eBook file over the iPhone icon in the AirDrop window. A dialog appears on the iPhone, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.7</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer329"><img alt="Figure 12.7 – Choosing how to load an eBook file on an iPhone&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.07_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.7 – Choosing how to load an eBook file on an iPhone</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Books</strong>. Your iPhone<a id="_idIndexMarker736"/> loads the sent eBook file in<a id="_idTextAnchor479"/><a id="_idTextAnchor480"/>to<a id="_idIndexMarker737"/> the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you have an eBook stored on an iPhone or iPad, you can also send it to your iPhone. The only limitation is that this eBook must not be a paid eBook, but an eBook file from a third party such as a PDF or ePub file.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor481"/>Adding eBooks from an iPhone/iPad </h2>
			<p>Oftentimes, a person might have a free<a id="_idIndexMarker738"/> eBook on their iPhone/iPad that they<a id="_idIndexMarker739"/> want to share with you using AirDrop. To send an eBook by AirDrop from another iPhone or iPad, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Unlock your iPhone and place it near the iPhone or iPad that contains the eBook file you want to send.</li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app on the iPhone or iPad that contains the eBook you want to share.</li>
				<li>Tap the Share icon. A menu will appear.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">AirDrop</strong>. When a window appears, listing all devices available to accept AirDrop items, tap your iPhone's icon, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.8</em>. A dialog appears on the iPhone (see <em class="italic">Figure 12.7</em>):<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer330"><img alt="Figure 12.8 – Sending an eBook from an iPad&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.08_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.8 – Sending an eBook from an iPad</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Books</strong>. Your iPhone loads the sent eBook file into the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've loaded an<a id="_idIndexMarker740"/> eBook into the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app, whether through the<a id="_idIndexMarker741"/> Apple bookstore or sent from another device, you need to know how to read that eBook.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor482"/>Opening an eBook</h1>
			<p>Once you've stored an eBook in the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app on<a id="_idIndexMarker742"/> your iPhone, you can open those eBooks at any time. The <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app provides three ways to find an eBook to open:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reading Now</strong>: Displays the most recent eBooks you've read</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Library</strong>: Lets you access all eBooks stored in the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Search</strong>: Lets you search for a specific eBook title stored in the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor483"/>Choosing from the Reading Now list</h2>
			<p>Many people may have<a id="_idIndexMarker743"/> several eBooks stored in the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app and switch between two or more eBooks. Because of this, the <strong class="bold">Reading Now</strong> list displays the most recent eBooks you've opened since it's likely you'll want to return to them later.</p>
			<p>So, any time you want to read an eBook you've read recently, check the <strong class="bold">Reading Now</strong> list first. Not only does this <strong class="bold">Reading Now</strong> list show you the covers of each eBook you've been reading, but it also shows you as a percentage how far you've gotten in each eBook, such as 83% or 45%.</p>
			<p>To open the <strong class="bold">Reading Now</strong> list to read an eBook, follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Reading Now</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. The <strong class="bold">Reading Now</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.9</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer331"><img alt="Figure 12.9 – The Reading Now list&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.9 – The Reading Now list</p></li>
				<li>Scroll left and right to view all your most recently opened eBooks.</li>
				<li>Tap the eBook you want to read.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Reading Now</strong> list shows you the most recently opened eBooks you've opened, but if you want to open a new eBook or <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>an eBook you haven't read in a long time, you need to browse your entire eBook library instead.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor484"/>Choosing from your eBook library</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Reading Now</strong> list only shows <a id="_idIndexMarker745"/>all recently opened eBooks. However, you may also want to browse through your entire eBook collection to find eBooks you haven't yet started, or haven't opened in a long time. </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app divides your eBook library into separate categories called <strong class="bold">Collections</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.10</em>. Each collection contains a different subset of your entire eBook library, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Finished</strong>: eBooks you've read all the way through</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">PDFs</strong>: eBooks stored only in PDF file format</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">My Samples</strong>: Reading samples retrieved from Apple's bookstore</li>
				<li>The remainder of the collections are shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.10</em>:</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer332">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.10 – An eBook library consists of multiple collections</p>
			<p>To choose an eBook from your entire collection of eBooks, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> icon. The <strong class="bold">Collections</strong> screen will appear (see <em class="italic">Figure 12.10</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap on a collection <a id="_idIndexMarker746"/>category such as <strong class="bold">PDFs</strong> or <strong class="bold">Finished</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap on the eBook you want to read.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The library lets you browse through your entire eBook list, but if you have many eBooks, this can be cumbersome. For a faster alternative, try searching for a specific eBook title.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor485"/>Searching for an eBook title</h2>
			<p>Browsing through a long list of <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>eBooks can be fine when you aren't sure what you want to read and just want to browse to find something interesting. However, if you know what you want, then browsing through a long list of eBooks can be tedious. </p>
			<p>To find a specific eBook faster, search for its title instead. By searching, you can find exactly what you want without wasting a lot of time. </p>
			<p>To search for an eBook, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Type all or part of a word or phrase that you want to find. As you type, a list of possible matches appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.11</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer333"><img alt="Figure 12.11 – Searching for an eBook&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.11_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.11 – Searching for an eBook</p></li>
				<li>Tap the eBook you want to read.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>No matter how you choose to select <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>and open an eBook, eventually you'll need to know how to read it. Reading an eBook is similar to reading a printed book, but there are some unique navigation controls you need to know in order to take full advantage of the iPhone's touchscreen for turning the pages of an eBook.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor486"/>Reading an eBook</h1>
			<p>With a printed book, it's easy to turn <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>pages individually or jump to another part of the book by just opening it up to another page. With an eBook, navigating from one part to another is different because an eBook displays pages that fill the entire screen. While you can see an entire page, it's much harder to see different parts of an eBook without a little bit of practice. </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app can store and display two kinds of eBooks: PDFs and ePub. Depending on which format your eBook is stored in, navigating between pages is slightly different. </p>
			<p>Regardless of which file format your eBook might be in, the four basic icons available in both ePub and PDF files are shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.12</em>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Close</strong>: Closes the book and takes you back to your eBook library</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Table of contents</strong>: Displays a table of contents for the entire eBook</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Search</strong>: Lets you type a word or phrase to find in the eBook</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Bookmark</strong>: Lets you mark a page to make it easy to return to later:</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="figure-caption"> </p>

				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer334">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.12 – Common eBook navigation controls</p>
			<p>By learning to navigate through an eBook, you can jump to the part you want to read without scrolling through multiple pages.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor487"/>Closing an eBook</h2>
			<p>You can only view one eBook at a time, although<a id="_idIndexMarker750"/> you can have several eBooks open at once. When you're done with one eBook, you need to close it so you can open another eBook. To see how to close an eBook, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Tap an eBook to open it. You may need to tap a page to view the Close icon in the upper-left corner of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap on the Close icon. Your chosen eBook closes and takes you back to the <strong class="bold">Reading Now</strong> list of eBooks. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Closing an eBook simply lets you open<a id="_idIndexMarker751"/> another one. You do not need to close an eBook if you just want to switch to another app. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor488"/>Viewing a table of contents</h2>
			<p>The table of contents lets you view all the<a id="_idIndexMarker752"/> chapter headings in an eBook so you can jump to a specific chapter. Depending on whether you're reading an ePub or PDF file, the table of contents looks different.</p>
			<p>To use the table of contents, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open an eBook. You may need to tap the screen to make the Table of Contents icon appear at the top of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the Table of Contents icon (see <em class="italic">Figure 12.12</em>). In an ePub file, the table of contents lists the eBook chapter headings, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.13</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer335"><img alt="Figure 12.13 – The table of contents in an ePub file&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.13_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.13 – The table of contents in an ePub file</p></li>
				<li>In a PDF file, the table of <a id="_idIndexMarker753"/>contents displays individual pages, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.14</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer336"><img alt="Figure 12.14 – The table of contents in a PDF file&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.14 – The table of contents in a PDF file</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Resume</strong> to return to the page you were reading or tap on a chapter heading (ePub) or page (PDF) to open that new page.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The table of contents can help<a id="_idIndexMarker754"/> you jump from one part of an eBook to another, but it can be cumbersome. As a faster alternative, consider searching for specific text instead. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor489"/>Searching an eBook</h2>
			<p>Searching lets you look for a word or<a id="_idIndexMarker755"/> phrase in an eBook. This way, you can find text without taking time to search for it yourself. </p>
			<p>To search for a text in an eBook, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open an eBook. You may need to tap the screen to make the Table of Contents icon appear at the top of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the Search icon (see <em class="italic">Figure 12.12</em>). A text field will appear at the top of the screen.</li>
				<li>Type a word or phrase. As you type, a list of matches appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.15</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer337"><img alt="Figure 12.15 – Matching pages appear as you type&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.15 – Matching pages appear as you type</p></li>
				<li>Tap on a page to jump to that page.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Searching can be fine when you<a id="_idIndexMarker756"/> want to find specific text, but what if you just want to find a certain page? In this case, it's easier to use a bookmark. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor490"/>Bookmarking a page</h2>
			<p>You'll rarely read an entire eBook from<a id="_idIndexMarker757"/> start to finish in one sitting. Instead, you'll likely read some pages, stop, and then come back to read where you left off. To help you mark where you left off, you can place a bookmark.</p>
			<p>You can place multiple bookmarks in an eBook and then choose which bookmark to jump to when you want to read that particular page. </p>
			<p>To bookmark a page in an eBook, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open an eBook and navigate to the page you want to bookmark.</li>
				<li>Tap the Bookmark icon (see <em class="italic">Figure 12.12</em>). (You may need to tap the page first to make the Bookmark icon appear.) The Bookmark icon turns red to let you know you've placed a bookmark.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After you've placed a bookmark, you can look for that bookmark later. The procedure for looking for bookmarks differs depending on whether you're using an ePub file or a PDF file.</p>
			<p>To look for bookmarks in an ePub file, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open an ePub eBook and tap the Table of Contents icon.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> tab. A list of bookmarks appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.16</em>. If you swipe left on any bookmark, you can open a <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button, allowing you to delete that bookmark:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer338"><img alt="Figure 12.16 – Viewing bookmarks in an ePub file&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.16_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.16 – Viewing bookmarks in an ePub file</p></li>
				<li>Tap a bookmarked page to jump to that page. The red bookmark icon appears in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>
				<li>(Optional) Tap the red<a id="_idIndexMarker758"/> bookmark icon to remove the bookmark. The Bookmark icon should now appear white. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you created a bookmark in a PDF file, follow these steps to view bookmarks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open a PDF eBook and tap the Table of Contents icon.</li>
				<li>Tap on the <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> tab. All bookmarked pages will appear, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.17</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer339"><img alt="Figure 12.17 – Viewing bookmarks in a PDF file&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.17 – Viewing bookmarks in a PDF file</p></li>
				<li>Tap the bookmarked page you want to read. Your chosen page appears on the screen.</li>
				<li>(Optional) Tap the red bookmark icon to remove the bookmark. The Bookmark icon should now appear white.</li>

			<p>Depending on whether you open an ePub or PDF eBook, you'll have different options for reading. An ePub eBook lets you increase and decrease the text size to make it easier to read. A PDF eBook lets you mark up an eBook with color, such as highlighting text.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor491"/>Changing text size in an ePub eBook</h2>
			<p>When you're reading an ePub eBook, you have<a id="_idIndexMarker759"/> the option of changing the size of text so that you can read easily or to display more text on the screen. Some of the options you can change to make reading easier include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Screen brightness</li>
				<li>Font size</li>
				<li>Font</li>
				<li>Background color</li>
				<li>How the eBook scrolls pages horizontally (default) or vertically</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To change the text size of an ePub eBook, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open an ePub eBook and navigate to any page.</li>
				<li>Tap the Text Size icon (see <em class="italic">Figure 12.12</em>). A menu of options appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.18</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer340"><img alt="Figure 12.18 – Modifying text in an ePub eBook&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.18 – Modifying text in an ePub eBook</p></li>

Choose a font and then<a id="_idIndexMarker760"/> tap the <strong class="bold">Back</strong> button in the upper-left corner of the screen:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer341"><img alt="Figure 12.19 – Choosing a new font&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.19_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.19 – Choosing a new font</p></li>
				<li>(Optional) Tap a background color such as white, tan, gray, or black.</li>
				<li>(Optional) Tap the <strong class="bold">Auto-Night Theme</strong> switch if you want the <strong class="bold">Books</strong> app to change the background automatically depending on the time of day.</li>
				<li>(Optional) Tap the <strong class="bold">Vertical Scrolling</strong> switch to<a id="_idIndexMarker761"/> toggle between scrolling texts horizontally or vertically. </li>
				<li>Tap away from the menu to make it go away.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Reading an ePub eBook gives you options for making text easier to read. If you want to read an eBook in low lighting, the <strong class="bold">Auto-Night Theme</strong> switch can make text easier to read without a bright screen that might distract others, such as someone sleeping next to you. </p>
			<p>Besides making eBooks easier to read, you might also want to take notes that you can save and share with others.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor492"/>Taking notes in an ePub eBook</h2>
			<p>Oftentimes, when you're reading, you may <a id="_idIndexMarker762"/>want to jot down notes or save passages of text. With a paper book, you can scribble in the margins or photocopy a page. With an ePub eBook, you can also take notes.</p>
			<p>To take notes in an ePub eBook, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open an ePub eBook and navigate to any page.</li>
				<li>Tap and press a word to select it and then drag the start and end markers to select more or less text.</li>
				<li>Tap your selected text to display a menu, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.20</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer342"><img alt="Figure 12.20 – Tapping selected text displays a menu&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.20_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.20 – Tapping selected text displays a menu</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Note</strong>. The Notes screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.21</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer343"><img alt="Figure 12.21 – The Notes screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.21_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.21 – The Notes screen</p></li>
				<li>Type some text for your<a id="_idIndexMarker763"/> note and tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've saved a note, you can always view or delete that note later. To open a note, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open an ePub eBook, navigate to any page, and tap the page to display the Table of Contents icon at the top of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the Table of Contents icon and then tap <strong class="bold">Notes</strong>. A list of notes will appear.</li>
				<li>Tap the note to jump to that note in the eBook. If you swipe on a note, you will see a Delete icon, allowing you to delete that note if you wish. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Jotting down notes about text <a id="_idIndexMarker764"/>can be handy, but sometimes you may just want to highlight passages in an eBook to emphasize what's important to you. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor493"/>Highlighting in an ePub eBook</h2>
			<p>Many people like highlighting text with <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>colored markers to signify important text. In an ePub eBook, you can mimic this using a red underline or different colors.</p>
			<p>To highlight text in an ePub eBook, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open an ePub eBook and navigate to any page.</li>
				<li>Tap and press a word to select it and then drag the start and end markers to select more or less text.</li>
				<li>Tap your selected text to display a menu (see <em class="italic">Figure 12.20</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Highlight</strong>. A menu of icons appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.22</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer344"><img alt="Figure 12.22 – A menu of highlight options&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.22_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.22 – A menu of highlight options</p></li>
				<li>Tap the colored circles on the far left. A menu of highlight colors appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.23</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer345"><img alt="Figure 12.23 – A menu of highlight colors&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.23_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.23 – A menu of highlight colors</p></li>
				<li>Tap a color to highlight your selected text. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've highlighted text, you <a id="_idIndexMarker766"/>can always change the color or remove the highlighting altogether. To delete or change the highlighted text, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open an ePub eBook and navigate to any page.</li>
				<li>Tap the highlighted text. A menu will appear (see <em class="italic">Figure 12.22</em>). </li>
				<li>Tap the Trash icon to remove highlighting or tap the colored circles on the far left and then tap a different highlighting color.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>One huge advantage of ePub eBooks is that you can highlight text and take notes. With a PDF eBook, your options are much more limited, but you can still highlight passages.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor494"/>Reading a PDF eBook</h2>
			<p>When you're reading a PDF eBook, you<a id="_idIndexMarker767"/> have the option of changing the size of the page or marking up pages with a virtual pen. This lets you highlight or mark up text.</p>
			<p>To read a PDF eBook, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open a PDF eBook, navigate to any page, and tap the page to display icons at the top of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.24</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer346"><img alt="Figure 12.24 – Icons at the top of a PDF eBook&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.24_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.24 – Icons at the top of a PDF eBook</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the Markup icon. Menus appear at the<a id="_idIndexMarker768"/> top and bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.25</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer347"><img alt="Figure 12.25 – Top and bottom markup menus in a PDF eBook&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_12.25_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.25 – Top and bottom markup menus in a PDF eBook</p></li>
				<li>Tap a pen type at the <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>bottom of the screen and slide your finger across the screen to mark up any text.</li>
				<li>Tap the undo/redo icons at the top of the screen if you made a mistake.</li>
				<li>Tap the Markup icon at the top of the screen when you're done. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Marking up a PDF eBook is one way to highlight important passages that you'll want to preserve. To make text easier to read, use a pinch g<a id="_idTextAnchor495"/>esture to shrink or expand text. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor496"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>The Books app ensures that no matter where you go with your iPhone, you'll always have something to read. While the Books app can display both ePub and PDF files, ePub files offer more flexibility in helping you read and jot down notes. </p>
			<p>Take time to load some eBooks on your iPhone so you'll never be caught without something to read. Although reading printed books may feel more natural, the more you read eBooks, the easier it will get. Over time, you'll appreciate the advantage of having available dozens or even hundreds of eBooks without carrying bulky books that you might lose.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you'll learn about storing important contacts. That way, you'll always be able to contact the people you need to reach at any given time.</p>
