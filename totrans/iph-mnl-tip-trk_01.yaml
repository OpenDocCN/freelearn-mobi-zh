- en: Before Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, mobile phones often sported confusing
    keyboards that flipped open and required you to press multiple keys just to type
    a single character. Not surprisingly, these early mobile phones were often confusing
    and clumsy to use.

- en: When Apple introduced the iPhone, they introduced an entirely new way to interact
    with a mobile phone. Instead of forcing users to type on cramped physical keyboards
    and squint at information crammed into tiny screens with poor resolution, the
    iPhone displayed nothing but a blank screen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This blank screen doubled as both a viewing screen and a virtual interface.
    Instead of sporting physical buttons, the iPhone could display virtual buttons
    that could adapt to whether the user wanted to type a text message, an email,
    or a website address. By adapting to the user, the iPhone screen proved far more
    versatile than previous mobile phones.

- en: The key to controlling an iPhone lay in its touchscreen, which could interpret
    touch gestures to perform different commands. Although today's iPhone is vastly
    different from the first iPhones of 2007, the touchscreen interface remains largely
    the same. To get the most out of your iPhone, you must learn not only what touch
    gestures are available, but when and how to use them.

- en: If you've ever pointed at something in a book or magazine, you've used a tap
    gesture. Tap gestures consist of pointing at – that is, tapping – something on
    the iPhone screen, such as an icon or a hyperlink. After tapping the screen briefly
    with one finger to select that item, you then lift your finger off the screen.
  prefs: []

    traditional PC.
  prefs: []

    I want." Since tap gestures select items, they represent a common yet simple touch
    gesture you'll use all the time.

    that you know the basics of all these gestures and the common ways to use them.
    While not all apps will support every type of touch gesture, most touch gestures
    can be used interchangeably across different apps. Here is a quick summary of
    the gestures we went through in this chapter:'

    able to use different touch gestures, so try experimenting with these touch gestures
    in different parts of every app.

    gestures in every app to see what they might do (if anything).

    gesture typically displays a menu of additional commands, while the pinch gesture
    expands or shrinks an item to make it larger (and easier to see) or smaller (back
    to its original size).
