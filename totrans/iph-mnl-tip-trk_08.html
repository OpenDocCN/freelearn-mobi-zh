		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor357"/>Chapter 8</em>: Listening to Music</h1>
			<p>In the old days, you could only listen to music outside if you carried a portable radio with you. Sony's introduction of the Walkman started a music revolution because you could now play cassette tapes wherever you went. Then, Apple changed the music world forever with their combination of iTunes and the iPod, one of the most popular portable music players ever. </p>
			<p>Instead of carrying bulky tape cassettes or audio CDs, the iPod lets you store digital copies of your favorite songs. With an iPod, you can carry thousands of your favorite songs with you wherever you go.</p>
			<p>When Apple introduced the iPhone, they combined the features of a mobile phone with the music-playing capabilities of an iPod. As long as you have your iPhone, you essentially get an iPod for free.</p>
			<p>The topics we will cover in the chapter are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Listening to the radio</li>
				<li>Listening to podcasts</li>
				<li>Transferring music to an iPhone</li>
				<li>Storing and organizing audio files on an iPhone</li>
				<li>Playing an audio file</li>
				<li>Deleting audio files </li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor358"/><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/><a id="_idTextAnchor360"/><a id="_idTextAnchor361"/>Listening to the radio</h1>
			<p>While the iPhone can<a id="_idIndexMarker489"/> play music, it cannot tune into AM/FM radio broadcasts that an ordinary radio can play. Instead of receiving AM/FM broadcasts, your iPhone can simply access the radio through the internet (either through Wi-Fi or a cellular phone network). This allows you to access internet radio.</p>
			<p>Apple offers Music 1, a 24-hour live radio station broadcast by Apple's DJs in Los Angeles, New York, and London. Best of all, Music 1 is free, so you can enjoy live shows, exclusive interviews, and new music from around the world. </p>
			<p>The Music app on the iPhone can <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>also access internet radio stations from around the world. Now you can tune into your favorite radio stations in another country or language, so you can choose between talk shows, different types of music, or sports broadcasts from anywhere on the planet.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note:</p>
			<p class="callout">Access to Music 1 and other radio shows may be limited depending on the area of the world you're in.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137">Listening to Music <a id="_idTextAnchor362"/><a id="_idTextAnchor363"/>1</h2>
			<p>The main goal of Music 1 is to help listeners <a id="_idIndexMarker491"/>discover new music based on lists curated by prominent DJs. To tune into Music 1, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Music</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Music app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Radio</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.1</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.1 – The Radio icon to access Music 1&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.1 – The Radio icon to access Music 1</p></li>
				<li>Scroll left and right under the <strong class="bold">Radio</strong> category until you find the Music 1 image. </li>
				<li>Tap the Music 1 image to start playing the Music 1 station.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>While Music 1 tries to play a variety of different types of music, you might want to pay for an Apple Music membership (<a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-music/">www.apple.com/apple-music/</a>), which gives you access to over 70 million songs<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> of all genres that you can play whenever you want. You may also want to listen to a radio station that focuses on a certain market, such as country music, talk radio, or classic rock. In that case, you can listen to any radio station across the world that streams its content over the internet. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor364"/>Listening to internet radio stations</h2>
			<p>Many people listen to local radio stations<a id="_idIndexMarker493"/> in their car or through a radio at home. Fortunately, most radio stations now also stream their broadcasts over the internet. That means as long as your iPhone has internet access, it can receive and play any broadcast stream from any radio station around the world.</p>
			<p>If you have a favorite radio station from home (either in another city or another country), you can tune into that station through the Music app. To listen to any internet radio station, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Music</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Music app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.2</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.2 – The Search icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.2 – The Search icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap in the search text field at the top of the screen and tap the <strong class="bold">Apple Music</strong> tab, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.3</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.3 – The search text field&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.03_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.3 – The search text field</p></li>
				<li>Type a radio station's name, call sign, frequency, nickname, or the type of station you want to find, such as <code>news station</code>. The Music app displays a radio station category with different stations that match your search criteria, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.4</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.4 – The radio station category lists stations matching your criteria&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.4 – The radio station category lists stations matching your criteria</p></li>
				<li>Tap on a radio station. Your chosen<a id="_idIndexMarker494"/> radio station logo appears as a banner at the bottom of the screen and starts playing its streaming audio, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.5</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.5 – Listening to a radio station&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.5 – Listening to a radio station</p></li>
				<li>(Optional:) Tap the play/pause button (to toggle between playing and pausing the audio).</li>
				<li>(Optional:) Tap the banner to display a volume slider that you can drag left or right to adjust the audio volume. </li>
				<li>Swipe down on the screen to <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>stop playing audio and return to the Music app.<p class="callout-heading">Note: </p><p class="callout">You can also start Siri and say something such as, "Hey Siri, play ESPN radio" or any other radio station you want to hear.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Radio stations tend to focus on certain markets, but they may offer multiple shows that you may not like. Instead of listening to a particular radio station, you might prefer listening to a particular show. One way that many people promote themselves and provide useful information is through podcasts. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor365"/>Listening to podcasts</h1>
			<p>Podcasts are informative and<a id="_idIndexMarker496"/> entertaining shows that focus on a specific topic, such as business marketing. Each episode typically involves one or more hosts talking for a fixed amount of time. Listeners can download one or more episodes of a podcast and listen to them at their convenience. </p>
			<p>Most podcasts are recorded in a studio, but some are live podcasts that are recorded in front of a live audience. Another variation of podcasts is podcast novels, which are similar to audiobooks. </p>
			<p>The main difference is that podcast novels can range from a single narrator reading a book to a group of voice actors combining sound effects to create an audio performance. Podcast novels are often a way for novelists to distribute their work, even if their novel hasn't been printed by a publisher. </p>
			<p>No matter what type of podcast you want to hear, the basic steps to playing podcasts are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Find a podcast to listen to.</li>
				<li>Download one or more episodes of the podcast.</li>
				<li>Play each episode using the Podcasts app.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you have no idea what specific type<a id="_idIndexMarker497"/> of podcast you want to listen to, you might want to browse through lists of popular podcasts and see which one catches your attention.</p>
			<p>To browse through podcasts, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Podcasts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Podcasts screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Browse</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. Different new and popular podcasts appear, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.6</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.6 – Browsing through lists of popular podcasts&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.6 – Browsing through lists of popular podcasts</p></li>
				<li>Tap a podcast that you <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>want to hear. A brief description of that podcast appears, along with a list of episodes, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.7</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.7 – Details about a podcast&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.07_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.7 – Details about a podcast</p></li>
				<li>Tap on an episode to listen to it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>By browsing through various podcasts, you <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>may stumble across an interesting podcast that you may never have thought about before. However, if you know what topic you want to know more about, you can search for a particular type of podcast that meets your needs.</p>
			<p>To search for a podcast by name or topic, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Podcasts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Podcasts screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. A search text field appears at the top of the screen.</li>
				<li>Type a podcast name or topic <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>you want to find and tap the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> key on the virtual keyboard. A list of podcasts matching your search criteria appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.8</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.8 – Searching for a podcast&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.08_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.8 – Searching for a podcast</p></li>
				<li>Tap a podcast that you want to hear. A brief description of that podcast appears, along with a list of episodes (see <em class="italic">Figure 8.7</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap on an episode to hear it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Listening to podcasts is fine, as<a id="_idIndexMarker501"/> long as you have an internet connection. However, for those times when you might want to listen to a podcast but won't have an internet connection (such as in an airplane or while bicycling on the road), you can still listen to your favorite podcasts by downloading them to your iPhone first.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor366"/>Downloading podcast episodes</h2>
			<p>The two ways to listen to a<a id="_idIndexMarker502"/> podcast is as streaming audio and as a digital audio file. When you listen to a podcast as streaming audio, you need an internet connection, but it won't take up any storage. When you listen to a podcast as a digital audio file, you must download and store it on your iPhone first, but you can play it even without internet access.</p>
			<p>For that reason, many people prefer to download podcast episodes so that they can play them at their convenience. One way is to download individual podcast episodes. A second way is to subscribe to a particular podcast so that your iPhone automatically downloads each episode.   </p>
			<p>To download podcast episodes, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Podcasts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Podcasts screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Browse</strong> or <strong class="bold">Search</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen to find a podcast.</li>
				<li>Tap on a podcast to view a list of episodes. The description of the podcast shows a <strong class="bold">SUBSCRIBE</strong> button and a <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon next to each individual episode, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.9</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.9 – Downloading a podcast episode&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.9 – Downloading a podcast episode</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">SUBSCRIBE</strong> button if you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>automatically download each new episode, or tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon that appears to the right of an individual episode. Then, tap the cloud icon with a down arrow in it to download just that one episode.  </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you start downloading podcast episodes, you can listen to them over and over again. Fortunately, you can always free up space by deleting individual podcast episodes or stop a podcast subscription altoge<a id="_idTextAnchor367"/><a id="_idTextAnchor368"/>ther.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor369"/>Deleting downloaded podcast episodes</h2>
			<p>After 24 hours, your iPhone will delete a<a id="_idIndexMarker504"/> podcast episode after you listen to it, but you can also delete it manually. </p>
			<p>To delete a podcast episode that you have previously downloaded, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Podcasts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Podcasts screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the podcast show that contains the episode you want to delete. </li>
				<li>Tap on an episode you have downloaded (it will lack a <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon in the right margin). Your chosen podcast episode appears. Near the volume slider, you'll see a <strong class="bold">…</strong> icon, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.10</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.10 – The … icon displayed by a podcast episode&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.10_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.10 – The … icon displayed by a podcast episode</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">…</strong> icon on the episode you want to delete. A list of options appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.11</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.11 – Options appear for your chosen podcast episode&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.11_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.11 – Options appear for your chosen podcast episode</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete from Library</strong>. A list of options appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.12</em>. You'll have the choice of <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> or <strong class="bold">Delete from Library</strong>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.12 – Options appear for your chosen podcast episode&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.12 – Options appear for your chosen podcast episode</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> or <strong class="bold">Delete from Library</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Rather than deleting individual podcast episodes, you<a id="_idIndexMarker505"/> might want to unsubscribe from a podcast altogether. That way, you won't keep getting podcast episodes that you'll need to delete anyway.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor370"/>Unsubscribing from a podcast</h2>
			<p>Subscribing to a podcast ensures that you'll download<a id="_idIndexMarker506"/> each new episode as it arrives. However, you may eventually want to stop receiving podcast episodes automatically. In that case, you may want to unsubscribe from a podcast. </p>
			<p>To unsubscribe from a podcast, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Podcasts</strong> and scroll down.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Download Episodes</strong>. A list of choices appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.13</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.13 – Options appear for your chosen podcast episode&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.13_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.13 – Options appear for your chosen podcast episode</p></li>
				<li>Tap <a id="_idTextAnchor371"/><a id="_idTextAnchor372"/><strong class="bold">Off</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Podcasts are often spoken audio that is <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>mostly educational and informative while also being entertaining. Although almost anyone can find a podcast that might interest them, not everyone likes the idea of listening to podcasts. However, almost everyone enjoys listening to music of some kind. As a result, you'll find that playing music can be one of the most common functions you might use an iPhone for.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor373"/>Transferring music to an iPhone</h1>
			<p>If you have audio files stored on <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>a computer, you can transfer them to <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>your iPhone using either a USB cable or Wi-Fi. </p>
			<p>Before transferring any audio files to your iPhone, first make sure that the audio file is stored in a format that the iPhone can use. Some of the more common audio file formats that the iPhone supports are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">AAC</strong> (<strong class="bold">Advanced Audio Coding</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">M4A</strong> (<strong class="bold">MPEG-4 Audio</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">FLAC</strong> (<strong class="bold">Free Lossless Audio Codec</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">WAV</strong> (<strong class="bold">Waveform Audio</strong>)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">MP3</strong> (<strong class="bold">MPEG-2 Audio Layer III</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you have audio<a id="_idIndexMarker510"/> files stored in other file formats, you'll need to <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>convert them to one of the preceding file formats first before transferring them to your iPhone. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor374"/>Transferring audio from a Macintosh</h2>
			<p>The Music app, which <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>comes with the latest version of macOS Catalina (or higher), replaces<a id="_idIndexMarker513"/> the old iTunes program. You can transfer any audio files stored in the Music app on your Macintosh onto your iPhone.</p>
			<p>On a Macintosh, you can import audio files into the Music app by choosing <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Import</strong>. Once you've added audio files to the Music app on a Macintosh, you can transfer that audio file to the Music app on your iPhone.</p>
			<p>To transfer audio files from a Macintosh to an iPhone, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Connect your iPhone to your Macintosh using a USB cable.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Finder</strong> icon on the dock to open the Finder window.</li>
				<li>Click on the name of your iPhone under the <strong class="bold">Locations</strong> category in the left sidebar, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.14</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.14 – Selecting an iPhone in the Finder window&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.14 – Selecting an iPhone in the Finder window</p></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Music</strong> tab in the<a id="_idIndexMarker514"/> button bar. A list of options<a id="_idIndexMarker515"/> appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.15</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.15 – Viewing a list of music options in the Finder window&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.15 – Viewing a list of music options in the Finder window</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Entire music library</strong> radio button (to select everything stored in the Music app), or click on the <strong class="bold">Selected artists, albums, genres, and playlists</strong> radio button (see <em class="italic">Figure 8.15</em>). </li>
				<li>Click on one or <a id="_idIndexMarker516"/>more checkboxes to select the different artists<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> of each audio file you want to transfer to your iPhone (skip this step if you chose to transfer the entire music library in <em class="italic">Step 5</em>).</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Apply</strong> button. Depending on how many audio files you're transferring, this process may take some time.</li>
				<li>Click the eject icon in the Finder window next to your iPhone, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.16</em>:</li>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.16 – The eject icon lets you safely disconnect your iPhone from a Macintosh</p>
			<p>The preceding steps <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>work with the newer Macintosh models. However, if you want to<a id="_idIndexMarker519"/> transfer audio files from an older Macintosh or a Windows PC, you'll need to use the iTunes program.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor375"/>Transferring audio files with iTunes</h2>
			<p>Until the Music app arrived<a id="_idIndexMarker520"/> with macOS Catalina (and higher), older Macintosh computers and Windows PCs stored and organized audio files using the iTunes<a id="_idIndexMarker521"/> program. </p>
			<p>To transfer audio files from iTunes (on either an older Macintosh or a Windows PC), follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Start iTunes.</li>
				<li>Connect your iPhone to the computer using a USB cable.</li>
				<li>Click on the device icon in the upper-left corner of the iTunes window, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.17</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 8.17 – Using iTunes to connect to an iPhone&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.17 – Using iTunes to connect to an iPhone</p><p>The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> pane<a id="_idIndexMarker522"/> appears on the left <a id="_idIndexMarker523"/>side of the iTunes window, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.18</em>:</p><div><img alt="Figure 8.18 – Displaying iPhone data in the iTunes window&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.18 – Displaying iPhone data in the iTunes window</p></li>

			<p>Once you've transferred <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>audio files from your computer<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> to your iPhone, you'll likely want to play one or more audio files later. To do that, you need to understand the different ways your iPhone organizes audio files.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor376"/>Storing and organizing audio files on an iPhone</h1>
			<p>The Music app on your iPhone<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> automatically stores and organizes audio <a id="_idIndexMarker531"/>files in an audio library that's divided into several categories, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.21</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.21 – The Music app organizes audio files into categories&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.21_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.21 – The Music app organizes audio files into categories</p>
			<p>Let's see how each of these<a id="_idIndexMarker532"/> categories organizes our music: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Playlists</strong>: Playlists organize <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>audio files into favorites, such as music from the 90s, love songs, classical music, or any arbitrary grouping you want to make.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Artists</strong>: This organizes audio files alphabetically by recording artist, such as the band or individual artist.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Albums</strong>: Albums organize audio files by album name, so you can find all audio files that come from the same album.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Songs</strong>: This organizes audio files alphabetically by song title.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Music Videos</strong>: Videos that contain songs from a recording artist.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Genres</strong>: Songs defined by musical genre, such as blues, rock, or pop.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Composers</strong>: Songs written by specific people.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Downloaded</strong>: This displays<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> only those audio files physically stored<a id="_idIndexMarker535"/> on your iPhone. In comparison, the other categories can list audio files that you may have selected within the Music app or iTunes program, but haven't physically transferred to your iPhone yet.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor377"/>Creating playlists</h2>
			<p>A playlist contains audio files<a id="_idIndexMarker536"/> grouped according to different categories. You could create a playlist of love songs, another playlist of songs from the 90s, and still another playlist of songs that use the bagpipes. Playlists can group audio files of any type you wish.</p>
			<p>The Music app creates some playlists automatically, such as the <strong class="bold">Top 25 Most Played</strong> or <strong class="bold">Recently Played</strong> audio files. If you want to create your own playlist, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the Music app and tap the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</li>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor378"/>Editing a playlist</h2>
			<p>Once you create a playlist, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker542"/> always add or remove audio files from that playlist at any time. </p>
			<p>To edit a playlist, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <strong class="bold">Music</strong> app, tap the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen, and then tap <strong class="bold">Playlists</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap on the playlist you want to modify. Your chosen playlist appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen.

				<li>(Optional:) Tap the red <strong class="bold">–</strong> icon to remove an audio file from the playlist (note: removing an audio file from a playlist does not delete the audio file from your iPhone).</li>
				<li>(Optional:) Drag the three horizontal lines icon that appears to the right of an audio file up or down to rearrange its order in the playlist.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Playlists let you add, remove, and rearrange audio files, but whether you use a playlist or not, you'll eventually want to know how to listen to your audio files.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor379"/>Playing an audio file</h1>
			<p>Once you store multiple <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>audio files on your iPhone, you can listen to those audio files at any time. Audio files are often songs, but can also be motivational talks, speeches, nature sounds, or anything you want to hear on a regular basis.</p>
			<p>One way to play an audio file is to play just a single audio file. This can be handy if you just want to listen to a single song or motivational speech.</p>
			<p>A second way to play an audio file is within a collection of related files, such as all audio files in a single album. With a collection of related files, you can play them in order or use the shuffle command to let your iPhone play audio files in random order. </p>
			<p>To play a single audio file, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the Music app and tap the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap a category, such as <strong class="bold">Playlists</strong>, <strong class="bold">Artists</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Songs</strong>, to view a list of audio files.</li>
				<li>Tap on the audio file you want to play. A thumbnail of your currently playing audio file appears at the bottom of the screen, displaying a pause button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.27</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.27 – The currently playing audio file appears at the bottom of the screen &#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.27_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.27 – The currently playing audio file appears at the bottom of the screen </p>
			<p>In many cases, you may not want to listen to a single audio file but a group of audio files, such as songs stored in a playlist or music off the same album. When you want to play multiple audio files, you can choose to play them in order or have the <strong class="bold">Music</strong> app shuffle audio files in a random order.</p>
			<p>To play groups of audio files in order or in a random order, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the Music app and tap the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap a category, such as <strong class="bold">Playlists</strong>, <strong class="bold">Artists</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Songs</strong>, to view a list of audio files.</li>
				<li>Tap either <strong class="bold">Play</strong> or <strong class="bold">Shuffle</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.28</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.28 – The Play and Shuffle buttons&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.28_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.28 – The Play and Shuffle buttons</p>
			<p>Playing audio files in random order<a id="_idIndexMarker545"/> can be like listening to your favorite radio station that plays the songs you like best. You know you'll like the next song, but you have no idea what that next song might be.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor380"/>Deleting audio files</h1>
			<p>When you no longer want to<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> keep an audio file, delete it. That way, you can keep your audio file lists uncluttered, keeping only the files you want to hear again and again.</p>
			<p>To delete an audio file, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the Music app and tap the <strong class="bold">Library</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap a category, such as <strong class="bold">Playlists</strong>, <strong class="bold">Artists</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Songs</strong>, to view a list of audio files.</li>
				<li>Tap and hold a finger over the audio file you want to delete. A menu appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.29</em>:<p class="figure-caption"><img alt="Figure 8.29 – Deleting an audio file from the Music app&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_8.29_B14100.png"/></p><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.29 – Deleting an audio file from the Music app</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete from Library</strong>. <strong class="bold">Delete Song</strong> and <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> buttons appear at the bottom of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete Song</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Deleting audio files can be handy when<a id="_idIndexMarker547"/> you no longer need them and want to free up storage space on your iPhone. If you have the audio file saved on your computer, you can always copy it back onto<a id="_idTextAnchor381"/> your iPhone at a later date. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor382"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Listening to audio files, such as music, is an activity that people all over the world enjoy. Although everyone has different musical tastes, everyone will likely want to keep audio files on their iPhone to listen to whether they're at work, waiting, or driving a car. </p>
