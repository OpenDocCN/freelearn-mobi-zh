But before we dive into Xcode, you need to learn Apple's new programming language—Swift. For people coming from a JavaScript background, this will look very familiar. Apple has taken the best parts and practices from both scripting and low-level languages, and integrated some amazing features of its own to make Swift easy for anyone to get into, and start coding. As we go further, we will see that Apple has also added a few features that really make Swift shine compared to other languages.</p><p>As we saw in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started</em>, we will be using Xcode's playground to do all the coding. Playground is a very versatile tool. Whenever you create a new file, you can start working on it immediately without any further setup. It has an inbuilt <strong>Results</strong> panel on the right that will compile your code in real time every time you make changes to the file. There is also an <strong>Assistant Editor</strong> window, which will give a graphical representation of the changes we make in the code.</p><p>In this chapter, we will start with the basics of the Swift language, from declaring variables to conditional statements, loops, arrays, functions, and classes. So, let's get started. Create a new playground file, name it whatever you like, and open it. If you have created a file in the first chapter, you will already have a file in the <code class="literal">_Playgrounds</code> folder that you can open.</p><p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Data types and operators</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Statements</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Arrays and dictionaries</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Functions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Classes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Optionals</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec20"/>Variables</h1></div></div></div><p>If you have some <a id="id92" class="indexterm"/>experience in coding in other languages, you should know what a variable is by now. If not, then know that a variable is something that holds a value that can be changed at any time. This is why it is called a variable.</p><p>In Swift, you can define a variable using the <code class="literal">var</code> keyword, similar to JavaScript. So, if I create a new variable called <code class="literal">age</code>, then I type <code class="literal">var age</code>, and that is all; a variable is defined.</p><p>Veteran C coders will notice that I missed the semicolon at the end. Well, it is not required in Swift, but if you want to use the semicolon, you are most welcome to do so. I do it out of habit and also because it is good practice. This is because after coding in Swift for a while, if you don't use colons and then use a C-based language, you will get errors all over the place.</p><p>But wait! There is an error. Swift is not able to figure out implicitly what data type <code class="literal">age</code> is; that is, is it an integer, a float, a Boolean, or a string? For Swift to implicitly assign a type, you have to initialize the variable. I can depict the age of a person as an <code class="literal">int</code> variable of value <code class="literal">10</code>, a <code class="literal">float</code> variable with the value of <code class="literal">10.0</code>, or as a <code class="literal">string</code> variable with the value of <code class="literal">Ten</code>. Depending on the variable type you assign, Swift will know that the variable is an <code class="literal">int</code>, <code class="literal">float,</code> or <code class="literal">string</code> type.</p><p>I am going to assign an <code class="literal">age</code> variable of value <code class="literal">10</code>. In the <strong>Results</strong> panel, you will see that the value of the variable is printed as <strong>10</strong>. This is the value that is stored in the <code class="literal">age</code> variable as of now. So, if you just type <code class="literal">age</code> in the next line, you will find the result displayed on the right side.</p><p>If you add <code class="literal">1</code> to <code class="literal">age</code>, you will see the result as <strong>11</strong>. This has not changed the value of <code class="literal">age</code>; only the line is evaluated and displayed. If you want to change the value of <code class="literal">age</code> to <code class="literal">11</code>, you can use the shorthand <code class="literal">age++</code> command to increment the value, as you do in Objective-C or any other C-based language.</p><p>Once a variable has been assigned a certain type, you cannot assign values of some other type. So now, if you try to assign <code class="literal">11.0</code> or <code class="literal">Eleven</code>, it won't be accepted and you will get errors.</p><p>Okay, we saw how to assign an <code class="literal">int</code> variable, but how do we assign the <code class="literal">float</code>, <code class="literal">string</code>, and <code class="literal">bool</code>? This can be done as shown in the following code snippet:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var height = 125.3
var name = "The Dude"
var male = true</pre></div><p>What if I don't want to initialize a variable? We can tell Swift the type of the variable explicitly as well. We can tell Swift that a variable is of a certain type by telling it the variable type that we would like to assign. We do this by adding a colon and the type after the name of the variable, as shown in the following code snippet:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var age:Int
var height:Float
var name:String
var male:Bool</pre></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>Instead of the <code class="literal">var</code> keyword, you may have seen this new keyword called <code class="literal">let</code>, which is very common in Swift. If you don't want a variable's value to change throughout the code, then you should use the <code class="literal">let</code> keyword instead of <code class="literal">var</code>. This will also make sure that the value remains constant even if you change the value stored by <code class="literal">let</code> by accident. These are also known as constants in other languages, which you can define using the <code class="literal">const</code> keyword, but in Swift, you use the <code class="literal">let</code> keyword.</p></div></div><p>In the preceding <a id="id93" class="indexterm"/>example, you know that no matter what, <code class="literal">male</code> remains a male throughout his life. So, <code class="literal">bool male</code> will remain <code class="literal">true</code> and remain constant; it will never change (well, unless the guy is really not happy with his gender). Once it is set to <code class="literal">true,</code> we can't change it to <code class="literal">false</code> even by accident later on. So, the syntax will change to the following:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">let age = 10
let height = 125.3
let name = "The Dude"
let male = true</pre></div><p>Once again, if you are not explicitly giving the data type, you will still have to initialize the variable. So, you might think that you didn't change anything. The results panel still shows the same value as it did when the variables were <code class="literal">var</code>. But try changing the values now. Suppose, for example, you incremented the <code class="literal">age</code> variable; try doing it now and you are certain to get an error.</p><p>So, if you know that a variable's value is bound to change, it is better to use <code class="literal">var</code>. Otherwise, you are safer using <code class="literal">let</code> to save yourself a whole lot of bugs in your code resulting from this.</p><p>Now that you have understood how to declare and initialize the variables, let's use these variables to conduct some operations using operators.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec21"/>Operators</h1></div></div></div><p>Operators <a id="id94" class="indexterm"/>are used in computer languages to perform various operations on variables. It could be an arithmetic operation (such as addition), a comparison operation to check whether a number is larger or smaller than the other, a logical operation to check whether a condition is true or false, or an arithmetic assignment such as increasing or decreasing a value. Let's now look at each type in detail.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec10"/>Arithmetic operators</h2></div></div></div><p>Computers were <a id="id95" class="indexterm"/>initially made to perform numerical operations<a id="id96" class="indexterm"/> such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In Swift also, we have operators such as <code class="literal">+</code>, <code class="literal">-</code>, <code class="literal">*</code>, <code class="literal">/</code>, and <code class="literal">%</code>.</p><p>Let's declare two variables, <code class="literal">a</code> and <code class="literal">b</code>, and initialize them with values <code class="literal">36</code> and <code class="literal">10</code>. If you want to make a single-line initialization in Swift, you can do it as shown in the following snippet of code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var a = 36, b = 10</pre></div><p>You can also use the semicolon to separate them, as shown here:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var c = 36; var d = 10</pre></div><p>This is useful if you want to initialize variables of different types. Now let's use operators between the variables. The result should be <code class="literal">46</code>, <code class="literal">26</code>, <code class="literal">360</code>, <code class="literal">3</code>, and <code class="literal">6</code>. Notice that the result of dividing an <code class="literal">int</code> variable with an <code class="literal">int</code> variable, is an <code class="literal">int</code> variable, instead of a <code class="literal">float</code> variable such as <code class="literal">3.6</code>:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">a+b // 46
a-b // 26
a*b // 360
a/b // 3
a%b // 6</pre></div><p>To get the exact result, we will need to type cast the variables. Type casting is done very similarly to how it is done in other languages; the type that you want to convert the variable to is added prior to the variable in brackets, as shown here:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">Float(a)/Float(b) //3.5999999</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec11"/>Comparison operators</h2></div></div></div><p>Logical operators are used to <a id="id97" class="indexterm"/>check whether a variable is equal to, less than, greater<a id="id98" class="indexterm"/> than, less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to the other variable:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">a == b //false
a&lt;b //false
a&gt;b //true
a&lt;=b //false
a&gt;=b //true</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec12"/>Logical operators</h2></div></div></div><p>Similar to other languages, you can use<a id="id99" class="indexterm"/> the <code class="literal">&amp;&amp;</code> sign to check for the logical AND condition<a id="id100" class="indexterm"/> and <code class="literal">||</code> to check the OR condition between two operations. These two are used to check whether both expressions satisfy their conditions or only either of the conditions is true:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">a==b &amp;&amp; a &gt; b // false
a==b || a &gt; b // true</pre></div><p>In the previous example, we know that <code class="literal">a</code> is not equal to <code class="literal">b</code> but <code class="literal">a</code> is greater than <code class="literal">b</code>. So, the first statement in the preceding example is <code class="literal">false</code> (because both its parts aren't <code class="literal">true</code>), but the second statement holds <code class="literal">true</code> because at least one condition is <code class="literal">true</code>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec13"/>Arithmetic increment/decrement</h2></div></div></div><p>Just as we increased the age <a id="id101" class="indexterm"/>in the first example by adding a <code class="literal">++</code> sign at the<a id="id102" class="indexterm"/> end of the variable, we also assign a <code class="literal">--</code> sign to decrement the value of the variable.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"/>Tip</h3><p>Keep in mind that <code class="literal">a++</code> is different from ++<code class="literal">a</code>. They are called post- and pre-increment operators respectively.</p></div></div><p>In the following example, we start with a variable, <code class="literal">a</code>, with an initial value of <code class="literal">36</code>.</p><p>If you do <code class="literal">a++,</code> it is called post-increment. It will first display the result and then increment the value of <code class="literal">a</code>.</p><p>So, if you do <code class="literal">a++</code>, which should have incremented the value of <code class="literal">a</code>, the result will still show up as <code class="literal">36</code>, suggesting that the value has still not been incremented yet. Yet, immediately in the next line if you ask it to output the value of <code class="literal">a</code>, it will show up as <code class="literal">37</code>.</p><div><img src="img/B04014_02_01.jpg" alt="Arithmetic increment/decrement"/></div><p>If you do <code class="literal">++a</code>, it is <a id="id103" class="indexterm"/>called pre-increment. It will<a id="id104" class="indexterm"/> increment the value first and then show the output. So in this case, it will show <code class="literal">37</code> in the same line where you incremented the value of <code class="literal">a</code>, and if you ask it to show the value of <code class="literal">a</code> in the next line, it will again show <code class="literal">37</code>, like this:</p><div><img src="img/B04014_02_02.jpg" alt="Arithmetic increment/decrement"/></div><p>This is just to keep in mind for the future, in case you encounter any bugs in the code and wonder why the correct value of your expression is not getting displayed.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec14"/>Composite operations</h2></div></div></div><p>We can also perform<a id="id105" class="indexterm"/> composite operations to increment, decrement, multiply, or <a id="id106" class="indexterm"/>divide by a much higher number, like this: <code class="literal">a+=10</code>, <code class="literal">a-=10</code>, <code class="literal">a*=10</code>, <code class="literal">a/=10</code>, and <code class="literal">a%=10</code>, which are shorthand ways of doing <code class="literal">a = a+10</code>, <code class="literal">a = a-10</code>, <code class="literal">a = a*10</code>, <code class="literal">a = a/10</code>, and <code class="literal">a = a%10</code> respectively. So, if you replace <code class="literal">a+=10</code> with <code class="literal">a = a + 10</code>, it will still give the same result. This is done for the sake of optimization and readability of code.</p><div><img src="img/B04014_02_03.jpg" alt="Composite operations"/></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec22"/>Statements</h1></div></div></div><p>Statements <a id="id107" class="indexterm"/>are of two kinds in any programming language—decision making statements and looping statements.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec15"/>Decision-making statements</h2></div></div></div><p>Decision making statements <a id="id108" class="indexterm"/>are of the following <a id="id109" class="indexterm"/>types: <code class="literal">if</code>, <code class="literal">if else</code>, <code class="literal">else if</code>, and <code class="literal">switch</code>. This is very standard in any programming language. Let's look at the <code class="literal">if</code> statement first and see how the syntax differs from other C-based languages.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec01"/>The if statement</h3></div></div></div><p>In Swift, the <code class="literal">if</code> statement is<a id="id110" class="indexterm"/> written like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">if a &gt; b {
    
    println("a is greater than b")
    
}</pre></div><p>Immediately, the guys using<a id="id111" class="indexterm"/> C will be like, "Blasphemy!! No brackets!!" Yes, in Swift for the sake of simplicity and readability, you don't have to use the brackets. If you want to, you can still use them, and you won't get any compile errors.</p><p>But you absolutely must enclose the statement in the curly braces. Even if it is a single line statement, it is absolutely mandatory. If you don't, you will get compile errors for sure.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"/>Note</h3><p>Here's a small <a id="id112" class="indexterm"/>note about logging code on the <a id="id113" class="indexterm"/>screen: we will be using this feature quite extensively when we start developing the game to make sure that the program is doing exactly what we want it to do. So, we will be logging statements to check for logical errors.</p><p>In Objective-C, we would use something such as <code class="literal">NSLog(@"Print Stuff to Screen")</code> or <code class="literal">NSLog(@"My age is: %d", age)</code>. In Swift, this is done a bit differently. For one, you don't need to put the <code class="literal">@</code> sign in front of any string to log it out. Secondly, to print the values, we have to use <code class="literal">\()</code> with the variable in the bracket:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">println("\(a) is greater than \(b)")</pre></div><div><img src="img/B04014_02_04.jpg" alt="The if statement"/></div><p>The same can be applied to strings:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">let x = "Dude"
let y = "Name"
println("\(x) is my \(y)")</pre></div><div><img src="img/B04014_02_05.jpg" alt="The if statement"/></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec02"/>The if else statement</h3></div></div></div><p>Similar to the <code class="literal">if</code> statement, the <code class="literal">if else</code> statement<a id="id114" class="indexterm"/> is written as<a id="id115" class="indexterm"/> shown here:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">if a &lt; b {
    
    println("\(a) is smaller than \(b)")
    
} else {

    println("\(a) is greater than \(b)")
    
}</pre></div><p>Instead of checking <a id="id116" class="indexterm"/>whether <code class="literal">a</code> is greater than <code class="literal">b</code>, we are <a id="id117" class="indexterm"/>checking otherwise, and now it will print <strong>30 is greater than 10</strong> by entering the <code class="literal">else</code> statement.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec03"/>The else if statement</h3></div></div></div><p>Similar to the <code class="literal">if</code> statement where we <a id="id118" class="indexterm"/>didn't put the<a id="id119" class="indexterm"/> brackets around the condition, in <code class="literal">else if</code>, we are not required to put the brackets around the condition:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">if a &lt; b {
    
    println("\(a) is smaller than \(b)")
    
} else if a &gt; b {
    
    println("\(a) is greater than \(b)")
    
}</pre></div><p>So here, we're checking whether <code class="literal">a</code> is greater than <code class="literal">b</code>, then print the following statement (from the code snippet) instead of checking for just the <code class="literal">else</code> bit.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec04"/>Conditional expressions</h3></div></div></div><p>Instead of taking 10 lines of <a id="id120" class="indexterm"/>code for checking such a<a id="id121" class="indexterm"/> simple statement, you can use the conditional expression statement to do the work in one line. This is more popular if you are just checking for <code class="literal">if</code>-<code class="literal">else</code>:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">a &gt; b ? a : b</pre></div><p>Here we check whether <code class="literal">a</code> is greater than <code class="literal">b</code>. If <code class="literal">a</code> is greater than <code class="literal">b</code>, then the expression evaluates to <code class="literal">true</code> and the output becomes <code class="literal">36</code>. Otherwise, the output becomes <code class="literal">10</code>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec05"/>The switch statement</h3></div></div></div><p>Switch statements<a id="id122" class="indexterm"/> in Swift are a little different from the <a id="id123" class="indexterm"/>way they are in other languages. Like the <code class="literal">if</code> statement, the brackets around the variable, or expression, are not required, but that's not the only difference.</p><p>All statements need to print some value, or some condition needs to be checked. You cannot have an empty case; that will give an error. Secondly, as all statements will be evaluated, a break is not necessary at the end of every line. In other C-based languages, all lines will be evaluated and executed, unlike the <code class="literal">switch</code> statement in Swift, where only the valid cases will be executed. Finally, the cases need to be exhaustive. This means that there needs to be a default at the end so that if none of the cases match, then a default value or statement gets thrown. </p><p>Let's look at an example of switch-case:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var speed = 30

switch speed {

case 10 : " slow "
case 20 : " moderate"
case 30 : " fast enough"
case 40 : " faster "
case 50 : " fastest "
default : " value needs to &gt;= 10 or &lt;= 50"

}</pre></div><p>Here, a new variable called <code class="literal">speed</code> is created. Based on the value of the speed, the system will print whether the value is slow or fastest. If <code class="literal">speed</code> is not a number, or the value is not between <code class="literal">10</code> and <code class="literal">50</code>, the default message will be printed. So in this case, as the value matches with <code class="literal">case 30</code>, it will print <strong>fast enough</strong>.</p><p>Instead of fixed values for case statements, you can also provide a range of values for which the statement will be <code class="literal">true</code>. So for example, if the value is between <code class="literal">0</code> and <code class="literal">10</code>, you would want the output to be <strong>slow</strong>. You can do so by giving the range from <code class="literal">0</code> to <code class="literal">10</code> as <code class="literal">0…10</code> in the first case. It is important that you put three dots between the values because they form an operator.</p><p>So now, if you change the value of speed to anything between <code class="literal">0</code> and <code class="literal">10</code>, the output will be <strong>slow</strong>. Similarly, the range can be used with other case statements:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">switch speed {
    
case 0...10 : " slow "
case 20 : " moderate"
case 30 : " fast enough"
case 40 : " faster "
case 50 : " fastest "
default : " value needs to &gt;= 10 or &lt;= 50"
    
}   </pre></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec16"/>Looping statements</h2></div></div></div><p>Looping statements are <a id="id124" class="indexterm"/>used to execute a particular block of code infinitely, for <a id="id125" class="indexterm"/>a said number of times, or until a certain condition is satisfied. As in any other language, we have the <code class="literal">while</code>, <code class="literal">do while</code>, and <code class="literal">for</code> loops, and we have a <code class="literal">for each</code> loop as in C# and C++11.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec06"/>The while loop</h3></div></div></div><p>In a <code class="literal">while</code> loop, we first<a id="id126" class="indexterm"/> give a condition. If the condition holds <code class="literal">true</code>, the <a id="id127" class="indexterm"/>block following the code will keep on executing.</p><p>For this example, we create two variables, <code class="literal">n</code> and <code class="literal">t</code>. We set <code class="literal">n</code> equal to <code class="literal">1</code> and <code class="literal">t</code> equal to <code class="literal">10</code>. In the condition, we increment the value every time the code is executed:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var n = 1, t = 10

while n &lt; t{

n++

}</pre></div><p>Once again, there is no need to put the parentheses around the condition. But you will see that, in the results panel, nothing printed except nine times.</p><p>There is a + icon, and there is another icon next to it. Pressing it will open a new pane. This is called <strong>Assistant Editor</strong>. In it, you will see a graph. This shows the increment of the value of <code class="literal">n</code> over the period of time the loop was running. It starts from <code class="literal">1</code> and goes all the way to <code class="literal">9</code>, since we told the loop to run only while the value of <code class="literal">n</code> is less than <code class="literal">10</code>. You can move the mouse arrow onto the nodes to know the value at each node. Alternatively, there is a scroll bar to scroll to the graph.</p><div><img src="img/B04014_02_06.jpg" alt="The while loop"/></div><p>You can also open <a id="id128" class="indexterm"/>

However, in this case, the block executes at least once and then the condition is checked.</p><p>Here, we are reducing the value of <code class="literal">n</code> by 1 every time it enters the loop and checking whether the value is greater than <code class="literal">0</code>. If it is, then the code block gets executed. The value of <code class="literal">n</code> from the previous piece of code is <code class="literal">10</code>, so it starts from <code class="literal">10</code> and goes back to <code class="literal">1</code>.

    }</pre></div><p>Here, instead of adding <code class="literal">1</code> every time, we multiply the value of <code class="literal">i</code> to itself to get a curved line in the graph, ranging from <code class="literal">0</code> to <code class="literal">81</code>.</p><div><img src="img/B04014_02_10.jpg" alt="The for loop"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec09"/>The for in loop</h3></div></div></div><p>Like the <code class="literal">for each</code> loop in other<a id="id136" class="indexterm"/> languages, you have a <code class="literal">for in</code> loop in Swift. It goes<a id="id137" class="indexterm"/> through each item in the loop and executes whatever has been stated by the code. Here, unlike other languages, it is not necessary to specify the type of variable. Swift will automatically understand the variable type according to the list of items you want it to loop through. For example, looping through a list of integers can be written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">for l in 1...10{

    l * l * l
    
}</pre></div><p>Here, even though we never mentioned in the code that <code class="literal">l</code> is an integer type, Swift automatically understood it, according to the list of values we gave in the code. Since the type of the list given is an <code class="literal">int</code>, the value of <code class="literal">l</code> automatically gets assigned the type <code class="literal">int</code>, and the output is provided:</p><div><img src="img/B04014_02_11.jpg" alt="The for in loop"/></div><p>Additionally, while<a id="id138" class="indexterm"/> looping through an index of an array, we would want <a id="id139" class="indexterm"/>to start from <code class="literal">0</code> and go to the last but one value. The same can be achieved using <code class="literal">..&lt; </code>instead of the <code class="literal">…</code> operator when specifying the range. So, in the preceding example, if we have to go from <code class="literal">0</code> to <code class="literal">9</code>, we can rewrite the code as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">for l in 0..&lt;10{

    l * l * l
    
}</pre></div><p>This is obviously not limited to numbers; we can loop through any data type. For example, we can loop through the characters in a string like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">for c in "string"{

    println("character \(c)")
}</pre></div><p>Here again, it was never explicitly mentioned that the type of the variable is <code class="literal">char</code>, and yet Swift was able to implicitly judge that <code class="literal">c</code> should be of the <code class="literal">char</code> type. In the console, each character will be displayed as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">character s
character t
character r
character i
character n
character g</pre></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec23"/>Arrays</h1></div></div></div><p>An array<a id="id140" class="indexterm"/> is a consecutive block of memory that holds a certain type of data. It can be a predefined data type, such as <code class="literal">int</code>, <code class="literal">float</code>, <code class="literal">char</code>, <code class="literal">string</code>, or <code class="literal">bool</code>, or it can be user-defined. Also, arrays are zero-based, which means that the first object in the array is <code class="literal">0</code>.</p><p>Arrays can be either of the <code class="literal">var</code> or <code class="literal">let</code> type. If we create an array of the <code class="literal">var</code> type, then we can change, add, or remove the objects from the array similar to how we have <code class="literal">MutableArray</code> in Objective-C. If you want an <code class="literal">ImmutableArray</code> array in Swift, instead of <code class="literal">var</code>, use the <code class="literal">let</code> keyword. Arrays in Swift can be declared and initialized as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var score = [10, 8, 7, 9, 5, 2, 1, 0, 5, 6]

var daysofweek = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"]</pre></div><p>Now, if we want to declare an array and initialize it later, we can declare it as shown in the following snippet of code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"> var score : [Int]

var daysofweek : [String]</pre></div><p>Here, you will have to provide the data type that the array will be storing. It is very similar to defining a regular variable; it's just that the type here is surrounded by square brackets. Now we can initialize it as we did earlier:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">score = [10, 8, 7, 9, 5, 2, 1, 0, 5, 6]

daysofweek = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"]</pre></div><p>To get an item at an index, you can use the variable name with the index number in square brackets:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">Score[0] // output: 10

Score[5] // output: 2   </pre></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec17"/>Looping through arrays</h2></div></div></div><p>To loop through an <a id="id141" class="indexterm"/>array, we can use the <code class="literal">for in</code> loop, as we saw in loops. Here, instead <a id="id142" class="indexterm"/>of passing the range, we provide the range itself, and as before, the data type present in the array is automatically determined by Swift:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">for myScore in score {

So, to add values to <a id="id144" class="indexterm"/>the <code class="literal">score</code> or <code class="literal">daysofweek</code> array, we do it as <a id="id145" class="indexterm"/>shown in the following code snippet. This will <a id="id146" class="indexterm"/>add the <a id="id147" class="indexterm"/>object at the end of the <a id="id148" class="indexterm"/>array:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">score.append(10)
daysofweek.append("Thursday")</pre></div><p>You can remove the last object from the array by calling this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">score.removeLast()</pre></div><p>If you want to remove an object at a particular index, you can use the following line:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">score.removeAtIndex(5) </pre></div><p>This will remove the element at the fifth index, which is <code class="literal">2</code> here. To insert an item at a particular index, we will have to provide the value and index at which the item has to be inserted:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">score.insert(8 ,atIndex: 5)</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec19"/>Important array functions</h2></div></div></div><p>Apart from functions <a id="id149" class="indexterm"/>such as <code class="literal">append</code>, <code class="literal">remove</code>, and <code class="literal">insert</code>, there are other built-in functions that we will be using quite often in games. The first is the <code class="literal">count</code> function, which tells us the number of elements present in the array:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">score.count</pre></div><p>The other function is <code class="literal">isEmpty</code>, which can be used to check whether an array has any items present in it or not:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">score.isEmpty </pre></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec24"/>Dictionary</h1></div></div></div><p>Also known as a map or <a id="id150" class="indexterm"/>hash table in other languages, a dictionary—like arrays—is a data collection type. However, unlike arrays—in which each element in the array can be accessed only by an index number—in dictionaries, we will provide keys with which we will be able to access the element at a particular index. The values of <code class="literal">keys</code> and <code class="literal">values</code> can be <code class="literal">int</code>, <code class="literal">float</code>, <code class="literal">bool</code>, or <code class="literal">string</code> values. You cannot have duplicate keys, but you can obviously have duplicate values in the dictionary.</p><p>For example, let's look at the FIFA's country code list:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">

So, when I want to refer to Argentina, I can simply call ARG and Swift will automatically understand that I am referring to Argentina. Here's another example: when we say, "get the value for the <code class="literal">ATG</code> key," the program will know that we are referring to Antigua and Barbuda.</p><p>The advantage of a dictionary is that the data doesn't have to be sorted. If we know that the key-value pair exists in the dictionary, irrespective of where it is in the list, we can get the value by asking for it by the key.</p><p>This syntax is similar to arrays. The only difference is that instead of giving one type of variable, we have to provide two during declaration, the first being the type of the key and the second being the type of the value.</p><p>Once again, you don't have to provide the types explicitly if you are already aware of the types of both <code class="literal">key</code> and <code class="literal">value</code>:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var countries = ["AFG": "Afghanistan",
                "ALB": "Albania",

You cannot change or provide a different type after declaring the dictionary keys and values with a certain type. Also, you cannot add a key of type <code class="literal">int</code> if you've already declared that the keys will be of type <code class="literal">string</code>.</p><p>We can also explicitly tell the types of the key-value pair, as shown here:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var states:[String: String]</pre></div><p>This tells us that the keys will be of type <code class="literal">string</code> and the values associated with those keys will also be of type <code class="literal">string</code>.

} </pre></div><p>So here, before a function, we will need to use the <code class="literal">func</code> keyword, followed by the name of the function, the parentheses, and the open and closed curly braces.</p><p>Calling a function here is very similar to any other language, that is, the name of the function followed by parentheses:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">someFunction() </pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec24"/>Passing a parameter</h2></div></div></div><p>Now, to perform<a id="id162" class="indexterm"/> some task<a id="id163" class="indexterm"/> on a variable passed to a function, we first need to pass a parameter into the function. This can be done as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">func printText(mtext: String){
    
    println("Print out \(mtext)")

}</pre></div><p>Here, we have to provide the input variable type within the parentheses. We cannot provide an integer here when the function is expecting a string, as it takes the type explicitly.</p><p>To perform the function, call the function and, within the parentheses, include the text that you want to perform the function on:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">printText("Hello Function")</pre></div><p>It should be noted that the value passed to a function is a constant by default. This means that even though we don't specify whether <code class="literal">mtext</code> is a variable or constant, it will remain a constant. So, you will not be able to make any modifications to it within the function.</p><p>If your code requires<a id="id164" class="indexterm"/> the type to be a variable instead of a constant, you <a id="id165" class="indexterm"/>need to specify this while creating the function:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">func printVarText(var mtext: String){

This has absolutely nothing to do with pointers. It is just a way to show that this function will return a data type, and that's all.</p><p>The function is written as usual, but at the end, we specify the return type after the parentheses by typing the dash and greater than sign, and then typing the return type.</p><p>Here, we are performing a multiplication using a function that takes in two <code class="literal">int</code> values and returns an <code class="literal">int</code> value.

let dVal = defMult()

println("The Multiplied valued is = \(dVal)")</pre></div><p>Here, we are assigning <code class="literal">20</code> and <code class="literal">30</code> as default values. We simply call the function to get an output of <code class="literal">300</code>.</p><p>But what if we want to modify only one value and keep the other value as default? In that case, we will assign a value by name, while calling the function. So, if we want the value of <code class="literal">a</code> to be <code class="literal">80</code> instead of the default value, we will do it like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">println("The Multiplied valued is = \(defMult(a: 80))")</pre></div><p>If we wish to change <a id="id170" class="indexterm"/>both the values, we can also do that, as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">println("The Multiplied valued is = \(defMult(a: 80, b: 50))")</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec28"/>Returning more than one value</h2></div></div></div><p>In Swift, we can<a id="id171" class="indexterm"/> return more than one value using tuples.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"/>Note</h3><p>Tuples are variables that can hold two values, like an array.

person2.age = 23
person2.name = "The Dude"</pre></div></div></div><p>In Swift, you will be able to pass the actual value, perform some action on the variable, and then return the variable. When returning two values, we will need to provide the return type of both values, separated by a comma:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">func getAreaAndPerimeter(a: Int, b: Int) -&gt;(Int, Int){

  let area = a*b

let perimeter = 2a+ 2b 
  
return(area, perimeter)

Then we return both the values:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">let value = getAreaAndPerimeter(40 ,80)</pre></div><p>The value is stored in a constant called <code class="literal">value</code>, and to output the values to the console, we use the dot operator.

But this can also be fixed quite easily in Swift. Just as we name the values while passing, we can also name the returned values. Then, instead of using index values, we can use the name itself to access the values:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">func getNamedAreaAndPerimeter(a: Int, b: Int) -&gt;(area: Int, perimeter: Int){
        let  area = a * b
        let  perimeter = 2 * a + 2 * b

So, if you want to initialize the <code class="literal">name</code> and <code class="literal">health</code> variables in the <code class="literal">init</code> function, you have to do it as shown in the following code snippet.

Here, suppose we want <a id="id179" class="indexterm"/>the character to take some damage after being hit. For this, we will create a new method, as shown here. Add this block before the closing bracket of the class:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">    func takeDamage(damage: Int){
        
        self.health -= damage
        
    }</pre></div><p>Methods in a class are defined like any other function. Here, we are defining a method called <code class="literal">takeDamage</code>, and it takes in a variable called <code class="literal">damage</code> of type <code class="literal">int</code>. Now we can call this function on the <code class="literal">hero</code> variable we instantiated earlier, and pass <code class="literal">10</code> for the hero to take 10 points of damage. If we call the <code class="literal">health</code> property again, we will see that the hero's health has dropped by 10 points:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">hero.takeDamage(10)

hero.health</pre></div><p>Now let's add one more property to the class and call it <code class="literal">armour</code> of type <code class="literal">int</code>. Let the initial armor level of the player be <code class="literal">10</code>. Each time the player takes a hit, his armor also goes down:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">    func reduceArmour(damage: Int, armour: Int){
    
        self.health -= damage
        self.armour -= armour
    }</pre></div><p>We add a new function called <code class="literal">reduceArmour</code>. In it, we take in an additional parameter called <code class="literal">damage</code> and reduce the <code class="literal">armour</code> property of the class by that amount:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">hero.reduceArmour(10, armour: 2)
hero.health
hero.armour</pre></div><p>Now, when we want to call the method, we have to explicitly mention that the second value passed is for <code class="literal">armour</code>. When we call the <code class="literal">health</code> and <code class="literal">armour</code> properties, we can see that <code class="literal">health</code> is reduced by 10 again and <code class="literal">armour</code> of the hero is now reduced by 2.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec31"/>Inheritance</h2></div></div></div><p>Like any other object-oriented language in <a id="id180" class="indexterm"/>which we wish to <a id="id181" class="indexterm"/>reuse or extend an existing class, Swift also allows inheritance. To inherit from another class, we will need to use a colon and specify the name of the class we want to extend while defining the current class.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"/>Tip</h3><p>Swift doesn't allow multiple inheritance.</p></div></div><p>Suppose we want to create a <code class="literal">Mage</code> class, and the mage has a property called <code class="literal">magic</code> so that she can do some "magic" damage along with regular damage:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">class Mage: Character2{

    var magic: Int
    
    override init(name: String){
    
        self.magic = 100
        super.init()
    
        //self.name = name
        //self.health = 60
        //self.armour = 15
    }

}</pre></div><p>Here, we create a new class called <code class="literal">Mage</code> and inherit it from the <code class="literal">Character2</code> class. We will need the <code class="literal">override</code> keyword to tell the code that we are overriding the <code class="literal">init</code> function of the <code class="literal">Character2</code> class, which is the superclass.</p><p>In Objective-C, we would usually call <code class="literal">super.init</code> first, but in Swift, we will need to initialize the <code class="literal">magic</code> property first, as this property doesn't exist in the superclass. So, we initialize it first and then call the <code class="literal">super.init</code> method.</p><p>If we create a new variable for a character called <code class="literal">vereka</code>, which is of type <code class="literal">Mage</code> and name her <code class="literal">vereka</code>, we will see that the name and other values assigned are of the <code class="literal">Character2</code> superclass instead of the name that we assigned:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var vereka = Mage(name: "Vereka")

vereka.name
vereka.health
vereka.armour
vereka.magic</pre></div><p>For the new name to be <a id="id182" class="indexterm"/>assigned, we have to initialize it again after we<a id="id183" class="indexterm"/> call <code class="literal">super.init</code> in the <code class="literal">init</code> method of the <code class="literal">Mage</code> class. So, we uncomment the lines of code in the <code class="literal">Mage</code> class where we assign the name and the new <code class="literal">health</code> and <code class="literal">armour</code> values to the <code class="literal">Mage</code> class. Now, the correct <code class="literal">name</code>, <code class="literal">health</code>, <code class="literal">armour</code>, and <code class="literal">magic</code> values will be displayed.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec32"/>Access specifiers</h2></div></div></div><p>In Swift, there are<a id="id184" class="indexterm"/> access specifiers that can be used to encapsulate classes, properties, and methods. Access specifiers provide read and write access to variables. Both <a id="id185" class="indexterm"/>the usual <code class="literal">public</code> and <code class="literal">private</code> access specifiers are present in Swift.</p><p>When creating a class, if a variable of a function is set to <code class="literal">public</code>, then any class can access that variable and modify it, but if it is set to <code class="literal">private</code>, then other classes cannot access that variable.</p><p>Apart from public and private access specifiers, there is also an additional specifier called <code class="literal">internal</code>. If you have used encapsulation in Objective-C or C++, you will be pleased to know that public and private variables work pretty much the same in Swift, and <code class="literal">internal</code> replaces the <code class="literal">protected</code> encapsulation type.</p><p>In Swift, the <code class="literal">internal</code> specification is the default specification type, unlike C++, where the default specification is private if not specified.</p><p>Even though we didn't specify the access specifier in the <code class="literal">Character2</code> class, we were still able to access its variables and functions in the <code class="literal">Mage</code> class, as they are internal and can be accessed by the child class:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">public class myCharacter {
         public var name: String
         private var age:Int  
         var speed:Int         
        
        public init(){         
          self.name = "The Dude" 
          self.age = 100     
          self.speed = 20
      }
} </pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">myCharacter</code> class and <code class="literal">name</code> variable are public. The <code class="literal">age</code> variable is private and speed is assumed to be internal because it is not specified otherwise.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec27"/>Optionals</h1></div></div></div><p>Optionals<a id="id186" class="indexterm"/> are a new data type in Swift. In all the cases covered so far in this chapter, we have always initialized a variable, whether we initialized it inline or in an initializer in a class. If we don't initialize the variable and start using it, we get an error saying that we haven't initialized it yet. The quick fix is to initialize it to <code class="literal">0</code> or <code class="literal">""</code>.</p><p>Suppose this variable is <code class="literal">score</code> and we have initialized its value to zero to get rid of the error. Now we try to retrieve the last score stored in GameCenter. For some reason, there is no Internet connection or Wi-Fi, and so we are not able to retrieve that player's last <code class="literal">score</code>. If we display the score on the screen, it will say <strong>0</strong> because that is what is stored in score. The player will be very confused and frustrated, as they are sure that the score was a lot more than zero in their last attempt. Now, how will we tell the player that we weren't able to retrieve the score because they forgot to pay the Internet bill?</p><p>In other words, how do we tell the program that there is no value in <code class="literal">score</code>? We can't even equate score to <code class="literal">nil</code> because we will get an error saying that it is not of type <code class="literal">nil</code>. For this, we put a question mark after the type. This means that if we assign a value, it will be of type <code class="literal">int</code>; otherwise, it should be treated as <code class="literal">nil</code>.</p><p>Now, at the time of displaying the score, we can check whether the value is <code class="literal">nil</code>. If it is, then we can print a message saying there is no Internet connection, and if <code class="literal">score</code> holds a value, we can print that as well:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var score:Int?

if score != nil {
    
    println("Yay!! Your current score is \(score)")

}else{

    println(" No internet! Pay your bills on time ")
}</pre></div><p>The preceding code will print from the <code class="literal">else</code> block, as the value is not assigned—it is still <code class="literal">nil</code>.</p><p>Now, if we assign a value, say <code class="literal">score = 75</code>, it will print the value but with the optional keyword along with the value in parentheses. This is because, since the type we specified is optional, it is letting us know the data type.</p><p>For it not to show the optional keyword while logging out, we need to "unwrap" the optional type. This is done by following the <code class="literal">score</code> variable in the <code class="literal">if</code> block with an exclamation, as shown in this line of code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">println("Yay!! Your current score is \(score!)")</pre></div><p>The optional keyword will now disappear when logging the score.</p><p>You might not use <a id="id187" class="indexterm"/>optionals in the games you create, but if you do have to, you will at least not be surprised when you see one of them.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec28"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we saw some basics of the Swift language. This should get you up to speed with the language so that from the next chapter onwards, you will have a good idea of the syntax and will know exactly what is happening in the code. You might also revisit the first chapter now and look at the code from the SpriteKit and SceneKit project files to see whether you are able to make any sense of the code.</p><p>As the chapter says, this was just a basic introduction to the Swift language. This language is quite similar in certain aspects and quite different in others when compared to other languages. When we come across any of these differences in the following chapters, I will be pointing them out so that you will be well aware of the errors and will know how to get around them and understand them better.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will dive into Xcode, look at it in depth, and start from the basics of Xcode.</p></div></body></html>
