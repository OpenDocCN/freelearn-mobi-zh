And we're not even done yet! It's about time for your hard work to pay off. In this chapter, we will discuss the following things to keep in mind during this final part of development:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Preparing your app for deployment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Monetizing (Making MOAR money!)</li></ul></div><p>All your hard work has come down to this, and now it's time to shine by making the money you deserve for working super hard! Of course there are way more options then simply charging for your app and, you know what, let's just dive right in to it shall we?</p><p>Let's begin making money...</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec29"/>Preparing to deploy</h1></div></div></div><p>It's finally time! It's finally that time; all your work has come down to this deployment.</p><p>For me, this has<a id="id253" class="indexterm"/> always been the most exciting time of development, especially when you get the e-mail from Apple saying that your app is in review.</p><p>Then, when it gets released, just seeing your app in the AppStore is so exciting! I'll never forget the first app I released, the moment I saw my first app I went around to show it to my whole family. I had finally done it. Now it's your turn.</p><p>To begin, we are <a id="id254" class="indexterm"/>going to create our app within iTunes Connect. Simply go to <a class="ulink" href="http://itunesconnect.apple.com">itunesconnect.apple.com</a> and log in with your Apple ID that is linked to your developer account, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_01.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>Once<a id="id255" class="indexterm"/> you've logged in, click on the <strong>My Apps</strong> icon:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_02.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>From here, you will now be able to see all the apps you have created (if any):</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_03.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>Just below the <strong>iTunes Connect</strong> logo, simply click on the <strong>+</strong> button to begin creating a new app. You will now see a roll-out menu appear, asking what type of app you would like to create. We will create a new iOS App.</p><p>You will then<a id="id256" class="indexterm"/> be greeted by a new popup window asking for some basic information for the app, such as the app name, app language, bundle ID (which I will discuss in just a second), version number, and SKU for your app (for the SKU, I literally just use the time I am filling it in, but you can use whatever you like):</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_04.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>Don't have a bundle ID? Simply click on the <strong>Register a new bundle ID on the Developer Portal</strong> button below the <strong>Bundle ID</strong> selection.</p><p>From there, it's simply a matter of filling in all the information, such as the App ID description, prefix, suffix, and services you want to include in the app.</p><p>Once you have it all filled out, return to the app creation screen and select the new bundle id (if it hasn't appeared yet, simply cancel the creation and try again).</p><p>Your app is now created! Well, somewhat...</p><p>The next page requires you to fill in the complete information regarding the app—that is, the description, keywords, screenshots, copyright information, and that kind of stuff.</p><p>Now, it's time<a id="id257" class="indexterm"/> to submit your app to the AppStore for review!</p><p>There are two ways of doing this. One is directly through Xcode and the second is through the Application Loader (both app icons can be seen in the following image); we will discuss how to do this.</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_05.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>No matter which method you choose to upload your app, though, both ways will require you to archive it. Before you archive the app, I highly recommend doing another test just to ensure that everything is working as it should.</p><p>To create the archive in Xcode, ensure that you have <strong>iOS Device</strong> selected under the scheme selection. To recap, schemes are presets on the simulator or iOS device you want to run your project on. The following screenshot shows the <strong>iOS Device</strong> option:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_06.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>Once you have that selected, simply click on <strong>Product</strong> on the toolbar, then select <strong>Archive</strong>. By archiving, you are essentially putting your whole project into a single, compressed file so that you can upload it to the app store.</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_07.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>Now, all you<a id="id258" class="indexterm"/> have to do is wait... Depending on how large your app is, you may be waiting for a while.</p><p>Once it's done, you will encounter the Archive window, which will show you a list of all the archives you have created for your awesome apps:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_08.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>Now, it's a good idea to validate your app through the iTunes validation process.</p><p>How do you do this? Simple! Click on the <strong>Validate</strong> button you see in the <strong>Archive</strong> window:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_09.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>If all goes well, you <a id="id259" class="indexterm"/>will get a window saying it's been validated. However, if you're like me, you will get an error, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_10.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>Sure enough, I had made a blooper and wasn't using the correct provisioning profile.</p><p>Once that's all done, we can upload it!</p><p>Simply click on the big <strong>Submit to App Store</strong> button!</p><p>In the dialog that appears, choose a team from the pop-up menu and click on <strong>Choose</strong>.</p><p>If need be, Xcode will create a distribution certificate and distribution provisioning profile for you. The name of the distribution provisioning profile begins with the text <strong>XC</strong>.</p><p>In the dialog that appears, review the app, its entitlements, and provisioning profile, and click on <strong>Submit</strong>.</p><p>Xcode will then upload the archive to iTunes Connect. If a dialog appears stating that no application record can be found, click on <strong>Done</strong>, create an app record in iTunes Connect, and repeat these steps.</p><p>If issues are found, click on <strong>Done</strong> and fix them before continuing.</p><p>If no issues are found, click on <strong>Submit</strong> to upload your app.</p><p>You have now uploaded your app to the App Store! Await an e-mail saying your app is in review!</p><p>This is the <a id="id260" class="indexterm"/>easiest way to upload your app, but alternatively you can upload your app via the <strong>ApplicationLoader</strong> option. Simply open the <strong>ApplicationLoader</strong> tab; you will be greeted by the <strong>Template Chooser</strong>, which will allow you to either upload your app or upload an in-app-purchase, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_11.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>Before we click on <strong>Deliver Your App</strong>, we need to export the project as an archive back in Xcode.</p><p>In Xcode, click on <strong>Window</strong> in <strong>Organizer</strong> and we will be back to the Archive of our app. Now, instead of clicking on <strong>Submit to AppStore</strong>, we will click on <strong>Export</strong>.</p><p>Next, it will ask how you want to save the app as— <strong>Save for iOS App Store Deployment</strong>, <strong>Save for Ad Hoc Deployment</strong>, or for <strong>Save for Enterprise Deployment</strong>.</p><p>Select <strong>Save for iOS AppStore Deployment</strong>, then click on <strong>Next</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_12.jpg" alt="Preparing to deploy"/></div><p>Again, it will <a id="id261" class="indexterm"/>ask you which development team you would like to use; select the team you are using.</p><p>It will again run validation tests, and then ask you where you want to save the archive.</p><p>Simply select an easy-to-remember location, then pop back to <strong>Application Loader</strong> and click on <strong>Deliver your App</strong>.</p><p>Select the app you just created. Application loader will then search for the application and display a window with all the application details, such as the name, version number, SKU number, primary language, copyright, type, and Apple ID.</p><p>Click on <strong>Next</strong>. <strong>Application Loader</strong> begins uploading your application binary file to the App Store.</p><p>Once it's done, all you have to do is wait!</p><p>You can always log in to iTunes Connect to stay up-to-date on the status of your app.</p><p>Now, it's time to make some dough!</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec25"/>Tips for monetizing</h2></div></div></div><p>Simply charging $0.99 (or a similar conversion for your country) for your app isn't the only way to make <a id="id262" class="indexterm"/>money on it. Actually, in my experience, it's one of the worst ways to make money from your app.</p><p>In fact, I have made more money with in-app advertising then I ever have with the funds from app purchases.</p><p>The best thing that you can do is make your app free, then incorporate some kind of advertising outlet such as <strong>iAds</strong>, <strong>Admob</strong>, <strong>Chartboost</strong>, or any other iOS-enabled advertising API.</p><p>Let's go through a few of the advertising APIs and how you can sign up for them and integrate them into your game.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec21"/>iAds</h3></div></div></div><p>Since you are<a id="id263" class="indexterm"/> already signed up as an iOS developer, you don't need to go<a id="id264" class="indexterm"/> through any sign-up process. You do, however, need to (if you haven't already) set up the appropriate contracts for iAds.</p><p>To do this, log in<a id="id265" class="indexterm"/> to <a class="ulink" href="http://itunesconnect.apple.com">itunesconnect.apple.com</a> and click on the <strong>Agreements, Tax, and Banking</strong> icon:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_13.jpg" alt="iAds"/></div><p>On the next screen, you will see <strong>Request Contracts</strong> if you haven't yet set them up. Simply request the <strong>iAd App Network</strong> contract. I recommend that you request all the agreements, but for this section of the chapter we only need iAds.</p><p>Once you have clicked on <strong>Request</strong>, you will be asked for legal entity information—in other words, information about the person who has the authority to agree to the contracts. Once done, simply agree and go back to the contracts screen.</p><p>When you're back<a id="id266" class="indexterm"/> at the contracts screen, you will be required to fill in your<a id="id267" class="indexterm"/> banking information, tax information, and so on, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_14.jpg" alt="iAds"/></div><p>Are you getting excited? I know I am! Here's some exciting information at a glance about iAds:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Banner views use just a portion of the screen to display a banner ad</strong>: We've all seen them, those tiny little ads at the bottom of a game we are playing or<a id="id268" class="indexterm"/> an app we are using.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Full screen ads provide larger advertisements to iPad apps</strong>: We can even show a full screen ad! This can come in handy when, let's say, the player beats a level. You can show a fullscreen ad, so it's not exactly disturbing a player's gameplay.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>You can pause nonessential activities while users interact with advertisements</strong>: Once the user taps on the ad, it will launch into a fullscreen interactive experience for the user. This obscures everything happening underneath, but fortunately we can pause everything going on in the game, so our player's progress isn't being hampered by an ad displaying, and our poor player runs into an enemy. That wouldn't be fun...</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Canceling advertising negatively impacts your app</strong>: You can programmatically cancel the interactive ad experience and force the user back to your app if your app needs the attention of the user. However, Apple recommends you only do this if absolutely necessary because it may affect your fill rates.</li></ul></div><p>Now we can start integrating!</p><p>It's really simple, so <a id="id269" class="indexterm"/>let's start by adding the iAds framework to our project. Do you <a id="id270" class="indexterm"/>remember how to add frameworks? The following screenshot shows how to do this:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_15.jpg" alt="iAds"/></div><p>Don't worry if you don't remember! In your Xcode, select your project in the sidebar. Then, in the center window, with your <strong>Target</strong> selected (see the previous screenshot), under general, scroll down to the bottom of the window where you see <strong>Linked Frameworks and Libraries</strong>:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_16.jpg" alt="iAds"/></div><p>Simply click on the <strong>+</strong> button to add a new framework. In the search bar, type the screenshot shows 'iAd':</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_17.jpg" alt="iAds"/></div><p>Next, click on the <strong>Ok</strong> button!</p><p>It's that easy! The <a id="id271" class="indexterm"/>iAd framework is officially integrated into our project! Now, all<a id="id272" class="indexterm"/> that we have to do is insert the code to display the ads.</p><p>We will hop in to our <strong>ViewController.h</strong> file and we will adjust the code so that it looks like the following:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;
#import &lt;SpriteKit/SpriteKit.h&gt;
#import &lt;iAd/iAd.h&gt;

@interface ViewController : UIViewController &lt;ADBannerViewDelegate&gt; {
    ADBannerView *adView;
}

@end</pre></div><p>To explain, we imported the iAd framework into the <code class="literal">ViewController</code> class, then we declared the <code class="literal">ViewController</code> class and <code class="literal">AdBannerViewDelegate</code> to control iAds.</p><p>We then declared the <code class="literal">ADBannerView</code> variable as <code class="literal">adView</code>.</p><p>Let's go in to our <code class="literal">ViewController.m</code> file now and change the following methods to display our ads. The bold text is what's new:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated
{
    [super viewDidAppear:animated];
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(handleNotification:) name:@"hideAd" object:nil];
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(handleNotification:) name:@"showAd" object:nil];
    // Configure the view.
    SKView * skView = (SKView *)self.view;
    skView.showsFPS = NO;
    skView.showsNodeCount = NO;
    
    // Create and configure the scene.
    SKScene * scene = [GameLevelScene sceneWithSize:skView.bounds.size];
    scene.scaleMode = SKSceneScaleModeAspectFill;
    
    // Present the scene.
    [skView presentScene:scene];
    self.canDisplayBannerAds = YES;
    
    adView = [[ADBannerView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];
    adView.frame = CGRectOffset(adView.frame, 0, 0.0f);
    adView.delegate=self;
    [self.view addSubview:adView];

}

- (void)handleNotification:(NSNotification *)notification
{
    if ([notification.name isEqualToString:@"hideAd"]) {
        adView.hidden = YES;
    }else if ([notification.name isEqualToString:@"showAd"]) {
        adView.hidden = NO;
    }
}</pre></div><p>Now, we will go<a id="id273" class="indexterm"/> on over to our <code class="literal">GameLevelScene.m</code> file. Let's scroll down to<a id="id274" class="indexterm"/> our <code class="literal">initWithSize</code> method and add the following code (again the bold text is added):</p><div><pre class="programlisting">-(id)initWithSize:(CGSize)size {
    if (self = [super initWithSize:size]) {
        /* Setup your scene here */
        NSLog(deviceName());
        
        self.userInteractionEnabled = YES;
        self.backgroundColor = [SKColor colorWithRed:.0 green:.0 blue:.0 alpha:1.0];
        self.physicsWorld.gravity = CGVectorMake(0, 0);
        self.physicsWorld.contactDelegate = self;
       
      
        
        if (_level == 0){
        [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@"showAd" object:nil];
        SKLabelNode *playLabel = [SKLabelNode labelNodeWithFontNamed:@"AvenirNext-Heavy"];
        playLabel.text = @"Adesa";
        playLabel.fontSize = 40;
        playLabel.position = CGPointMake(self.size.width / 2.0, self.size.height / 1.7);
        [self addChild:playLabel];
            
        SKSpriteNode *playButton = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamed:@"play"];
        playButton.position = CGPointMake(self.size.width /2.0 , self.size.height / 2.5);
        playButton.name = @"playButton";
        [self addChild:playButton];
        }
      
    }
    return self;
}</pre></div><p>Then, we will <a id="id275" class="indexterm"/>scroll down even further to our <code class="literal">touchesBegan:</code> method and, <a id="id276" class="indexterm"/>within the <code class="literal">if (node.name isEqualToString:@"playButton"])</code> method, add the following code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@"hideAd" object:nil];</pre></div><p>Confused? No problem!</p><p>What we did is set up a notification center to accept certain, well, notifications. This is an easy way to call methods between different class files. All we did is set up the notification center in our <code class="literal">ViewController</code> class to receive a notification to show and hide the banners.</p><p>Why do we do it this way?</p><p>Banner views are only able to be displayed on a <code class="literal">ViewController</code> class. In the case of our game, we only have one view controller, whereas our <code class="literal">GameLevelScene</code>  is not a <code class="literal">ViewController</code> class; it's a SpriteKit scene that is displayed on our <code class="literal">ViewController</code> class. Ergo, if you were to set up and display the Banner View in our scene, it wouldn't show up because it's a SpriteKit scene, not a <code class="literal">ViewController</code> class.</p><p>Makes sense?</p><p>Once you have everything coded, test to see what happens!</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_18.jpg" alt="iAds"/></div><p>Then, when<a id="id277" class="indexterm"/> you<a id="id278" class="indexterm"/> click on the play button, you will see the following:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_19.jpg" alt="iAds"/></div><p>All gone!</p><p>Keep in mind that <a id="id279" class="indexterm"/>no actual ads will appear until the game has been <a id="id280" class="indexterm"/>released; until then, it will display placeholder ads.</p><p>That's it! You are now well on your way to making ad money!</p><p>Now, let's talk about the other advertising outlets.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec22"/>AdMob</h3></div></div></div><p>After <a id="id281" class="indexterm"/>downloading the framework (which you can find easily on Google), extract it to a place that's easy to locate again.</p><p>All we have<a id="id282" class="indexterm"/> to do is right-click on our project on the left-hand side bar, and choose <strong>Add Files To (Your Project Name)</strong>:</p><p>Locate the <code class="literal">GoogleMobileAds.framework</code> you just downloaded, and add it.</p><p>The AdMob SDK <a id="id283" class="indexterm"/>depends on the following iOS development frameworks, which may not already be part of your project:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">AdSupport</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">AudioToolbox</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">AVFoundation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">CoreGraphics</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">CoreMedia</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">CoreTelephony</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">EventKit</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">EventKitUI</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">MessageUI</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">StoreKit</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">SystemConfiguration</li></ul></div><p>Once you have imported these frameworks and referenced the AdMob SDK, Xcode will automatically<a id="id284" class="indexterm"/> link to the required frameworks.</p><p>Following Google's own documentation, add the following code in your <code class="literal">ViewController</code> class to set up ads:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">@import GoogleMobileAds;

#import "ViewController.h"

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
 [super viewDidLoad];

 NSLog(@"Google Mobile Ads SDK version: %@", [GADRequest sdkVersion]);
}

- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {
 [super didReceiveMemoryWarning];
}

@end</pre></div><p>Now that<a id="id285" class="indexterm"/> our project has the SDK referenced, let's put banner ads into it.</p><p>A <strong>GADBannerView</strong> (<strong>GoogleAd Banner View</strong>) can be created from a storyboard or from code. For <a id="id286" class="indexterm"/>regular apps, things are put together in the Storyboard editor but the same methods work for a game such as ours, just remember to keep the code in your <code class="literal">ViewController</code> class:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_20.jpg" alt="AdMob"/></div><p>Open the main <a id="id287" class="indexterm"/>storyboard and, in the <code class="literal">Object</code> library in the bottom-right corner, search for <code class="literal">UIView</code> and drag a <code class="literal">UIView</code> element into your view controller. Then, in the <strong>Identity inspector</strong> button in the top-right corner, we will change the class of this view to a <code class="literal">GADBannerView</code>, as seen in the previous image:</p><p>The <code class="literal">GADBannerView</code> class needs a reference in code to load ads into it. Open the <strong>Assistant Editor</strong> by navigating to <strong>View</strong> | <strong>Assistant Editor</strong> | <strong>Show Assistant Editor</strong>:</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_21.jpg" alt="AdMob"/></div><p>In the <a id="id288" class="indexterm"/>assistant editor, ensure that the <code class="literal">ViewController.h</code> file is displayed. Next, holding the Control key (or just right-click and drag), click on the <code class="literal">GADBannerView</code> element and drag your cursor over to the <code class="literal">ViewController.h</code> file.</p><p>This is the easiest way to link outlets in your storyboard to code. This has been extremely streamlined and takes a bunch of work out of programming; previously, we would have had to manually type the outlet, then link it manually in the storyboard editor, which wasn't fun. We are going to add the following code, by doing the following, we are going to import the Google ads framework:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">@import GoogleMobileAds;

@interface ViewController : UIViewController

@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet GADBannerView *bannerView;</pre></div><p>You then add the following code and make the required adjustments to the methods that are already in your <code class="literal">ViewController.m</code> file.</p><p>Now, to display an ad, just insert the following method in either the <code class="literal">ViewDidLoad</code> section or wherever you would like it to appear:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"> NSLog(@"Google Mobile Ads SDK version: %@", [GADRequest sdkVersion]);
 self.bannerView.adUnitID = @"ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2934735716";
 self.bannerView.rootViewController = self;
 [self.bannerView loadRequest:[GADRequest request]];</pre></div><p>It's (almost) that easy!</p><p>There are a few<a id="id289" class="indexterm"/> changes that need to be made, though. First, you need to <a id="id290" class="indexterm"/>create a new <code class="literal">AppID</code> variable through the website. All you gotta do is copy and paste the ID in place of the one that is after <code class="literal">self.bannerView.adUnitID =</code>.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec26"/>Implementing Chartboost!</h2></div></div></div><p>Importing the framework will be the same no matter what framework you import. Here are the<a id="id291" class="indexterm"/> required frameworks for Chartboost:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">StoreKit</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">CoreGraphics</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">UIKit</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Foundation</li></ul></div><p>You will have to <a id="id292" class="indexterm"/>add only one of these. The other three should be included with a SpriteKit project. For Chartboost, we need to start in our <code class="literal">AppDelegate</code> class to initialize the app ID and app signature, both of which are set up under Chartboost's website. At the top of the <code class="literal">AppDelegate.m</code> file, we need to import the following:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">#import &lt;Chartboost/Chartboost.h&gt;
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import &lt;CommonCrypto/CommonDigest.h&gt;
#import &lt;AdSupport/AdSupport.h&gt;</pre></div><p>Then, inside our <code class="literal">Application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions</code> method, we need to add the following block of code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"> [Chartboost startWithAppId:@"YOUR_CHARTBOOST_APP_ID"
                  appSignature:@"YOUR_CHARTBOOST_APP_SIGNATURE"
                      delegate:self];</pre></div><p>There is a note, Chartboost must be initialized this way, as they record app bootups to track analytics for you. If you don't do it this way, you won't get any ads. Then you cry. Want to know what's next? The following code will show us the ad:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">[Chartboost showInterstitial:CBLocationHomeScreen];</pre></div><p>It's really that easy! Simply add that line of code when you want to display your ad and boom! Done! I can smell the revenue now!</p><p>You know, you guys are a great audience, I really hope you've enjoyed and learned a lot from this book.</p><p>I really feel you will be able to create your own full-fledged games and monetize them with extreme ease.</p><p>But you know what... we aren't done yet. No no! We are actually going to talk about updating your app, and adding multiplayer functionality!</p><p>Buckle up, this last<a id="id293" class="indexterm"/> chapter is going to be a blast!</p><a id="id294" class="indexterm"/><p>It is too dangerous to go alone... Does the following image seem familiar?</p><div><img src="img/B03553_07_22.jpg" alt="Implementing Chartboost!"/></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec30"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, you learned how to deploy your app on the App store and how to make money on your published app by incorporating advertising outlets, such as iAds, Admob, and Chartboost. Now, you can develop and deploy as many app as you want. Enjoy developing, deploying, and earning money on your apps.</p></div></body></html>
