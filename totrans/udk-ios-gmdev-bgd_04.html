<span class="strong"><strong>Kismet?</strong></span> is a system of visual scripting in UDK that makes it possible for people to affect the game world and design gameplay events. For teams without a programmer, Kismet can be a Godsend; it makes it possible for someone without any coding knowledge to do things that would otherwise require the use of<span class="strong"><strong> UnrealScript</strong></span>, a programming language that the Unreal Engine uses.<a class="indexterm" id="id239"/>
</p><p>In order to create a? sequence of events, you have to connect a series of sequence objects together. This, in turn, generates code when the game is run, which causes it to do the things that you said it should do. It would be easy for me to write a book entirely about things that can be done in Kismet, but as we are planning on creating a third person shooter for the iOS, I will refrain from straying too far from that. However, we will be discussing the creation of more and more complex sequences as the book progresses.<a class="indexterm" id="id240"/>

Let's say we want it to be in third-person instead. It will be quite easy to do so due to Epic's console command which does just that. However, in order to first simplify learning Kismet as much as possible and practice what we've learned in previous chapters, we are going to be starting from scratch with a new level.<a class="indexterm" id="id241"/>

Start up your game using the<span class="strong"><strong> Play</strong></span> |<span class="strong"><strong> InEditor</strong></span> option?.

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Parts of a sequence object" height="76" src="graphics/image_1901_04_07.jpg"/></div><p>The left-hand side of a sequence object is? called the<span class="strong"><strong> Input</strong></span>; while the right-hand side is called the<span class="strong"><strong> Output</strong></span>.

Code in Kismet only gets called if a certain thing happens, like the<span class="strong"><strong> Player Spawned</strong></span> event that was called when the player spawns in our level. These objects are red and are shaped like diamonds.<a class="indexterm" id="id251"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Actions</strong></span>: These perform a defined task when an event is triggered. This is the most used item, so it is the object with the most variety. The<span class="strong"><strong> Console Command</strong></span> action, as well as the<span class="strong"><strong> Delay</strong></span> used previously, is an example of an action. Actions are presented as rectangles.<a class="indexterm" id="id252"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Variables</strong></span>: These are what hold information within our level. If another sequence object has squares underneath it, that is a spot that holds a variable. They are colored differently depending on what the variable actually is. The instigator in the<span class="strong"><strong> Player Spawned</strong></span> event? is a variable that is filled with our player's information when it is called, and the<span class="strong"><strong> Blue</strong></span> number under the<span class="strong"><strong> Delay</strong></span> variable in the previous screenshot is a float variable with the value of<code class="literal"> 2.0</code>. We will be using variables extensively in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Bringing it All Together">Chapter 6</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Bringing It All Together</em></span>.

<div class="section" title="Benefits and drawbacks of using Kismet"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec05"/>Benefits and drawbacks of using Kismet</h1></div></div></div><p>As with any job, it is important to use the tool that is appropriate for it. UDK provides three ways of giving interactivity to the game world: Kismet (which we are discussing), Matinee (which we are going to discuss), and UnrealScript (which is out of the scope of this book, but it is covered extremely well in<span class="emphasis"><em> Unreal Development Kit Game Programming with UnrealScript: Beginner's Guide</em></span> by<span class="emphasis"><em> Rachel Cordone</em></span> which is also available from Packt Publishing). All three have specific advantages and disadvantages to them, but Kismet is the one that I use most often.</p><p>As you expand your research into UDK after reading this book, you may see forum posts with people asking how to do something in Kismet. A lot of people will reply to telling them to learn UnrealScript instead. While they may seem arrogant, there are some reasons why they are saying to use that tool. I've included a list of pros and cons of Kismet which may help you, afterwards, in deciding if it is the correct tool for what you're working on.</p><div class="section" title="Benefits of using Kismet"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec03"/>Benefits of using Kismet</h2></div></div></div><p>Kismet is a wonderful tool and is a great starting point when first starting out with UDK. Some other benefits associated with Kismet are:<a class="indexterm" id="id255"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Having a lower barrier to entry</strong></span>: No programming knowledge is needed so it is easier to get started and you can start creating games now.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Great for prototyping gameplay mechanics</strong></span>: Saying a mechanic is going to be fun is one thing, but no one is going to believe you unless you can prove it. Kismet makes it extremely easy to get something up quickly. As a designer, having something to show a programmer will make it much easier for them to translate to code.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Great for one-off events</strong></span>: If your level needs to have something specific or only at a specific time or level events like an explosion, Kismet is a great tool to use.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Easier to see the flow of events</strong></span>: If you are more of a visual thinker or like to stare at something to see the big picture, it is a lot easier to use Kismet. The Sequence Objects and colors all mean something specific to make it easy to discern what is going on within a specific scene.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Easily extendable with UnrealScript</strong></span>: With knowledge of how UnrealScript works, it is possible to create custom sequence objects of your own to create actions of your very own. If your game would have a dialogue system, creating a custom<span class="strong"><strong> Show Dialog</strong></span> action would be possible in Kismet to make it easy to create entire dialog trees within Kismet.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Drawbacks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec04"/>Drawbacks</h2></div></div></div><p>However, Kismet is not the be-all and end-all solution for everything that can possibly be done with UDK. Here are some of the drawbacks that using Kismet may have:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Complexity issues</strong></span>: As you get more comfortable using Kismet, you will probably try to? do more and more complex things with it (I know I have). If you are not careful you may have problems reading what your code is actually doing. Basically, the more complex a sequence gets, the harder it is to read.<a class="indexterm" id="id256"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Reiterations</strong></span>: Many times in a game, you will want to have the same thing happen if you interact with a similar or identical object, like a door. If you want the same behavior with multiple objects or multiple levels, you have to paste it every single time you want to have that action happen. This can quickly stockpile into a really large amount of sequence objects which could be avoided if you wrote an UnrealScript file with the same behavior and made that object use that file to execute the actions within it.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Level Specific</strong></span>: In much the same way Kismet is also specific to just the level that it is created in. For instance, if we wanted to create ten levels in our game, we would have to do the console command event in every single level. With UnrealScript, this would be built into the code base for the game and be automatic for all levels of the game.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Kismet can't do everything you'd like to in a game</strong></span>: The truth is that the game Unreal Engine 3 was created to make a<span class="strong"><strong> First Person Shooter</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>FPS</strong></span>), and the further you stray from that path, the harder it is going to be to create your game. That's not to say UDK can't be used to create other games. It's just going to be much more difficult as the sequence objects in Kismet are meant to create an FPS.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>More custom behavior requires UnrealScript</strong></span>: Continuing with the previous point, most of the time a game does something such as a game mechanics that UDK doesn't seem to do (like the Scarecrow boss battles in<span class="emphasis"><em> Batman: Arkham Asylum</em></span>, "Plasmids" in<span class="emphasis"><em> Bioshock 1</em></span> and<span class="emphasis"><em> 2</em></span>, or the jet packs in<span class="emphasis"><em> Dark Void</em></span>). These examples probably use UnrealScript or C++ code to achieve the desired result.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Kismet is slower than UnrealScript</strong></span>: While it will not matter with the project that we are creating now, as Kismet is basically a prewritten UnrealScript executed in a certain order, Kismet is slower than what could be achieved using just UnrealScript, and something that your game will continuously use would best be done with UnrealScript.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Have a go hero—Kismet"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec05"/>Have a go hero—Kismet</h2></div></div></div><p>Console commands can do a lot of different things, giving you access to a lot of prewritten code including opening other maps (<code class="literal">open levelname</code>), and quitting the game (<code class="literal">quit</code>).</p><p>Try to make the game open another map when you start the level.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Defining Matinee"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec06"/>Defining Matinee</h1></div></div></div><p>The<span class="strong"><strong> Matinee</strong></span> tool is the driving force of all cinematic effects within the Unreal Engine. It gives users the ability to be the director within your game, giving you control over the camera, actor's movement, sound, as well as different cuts and animation effects. Think of any moment in an Unreal game where you didn't have direct control over the character, like a cutscene. Chances are, that was done in Matinee. However, Matinee can be used for many other things which we will discuss later.<a class="indexterm" id="id257"/>

<span class="strong"><strong>Mobile Object Picker</strong></span> is a simple way to check if target object with collision is being touched by a<span class="strong"><strong> Touch</strong></span> input if it is within the<span class="strong"><strong> Trace Distance</strong></span> away from the player. It will only call once unless you set<span class="strong"><strong> Check on Touch</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> TRUE</strong></span>, then it will call once every frame. Like everything that does an action every frame, it is advised to set a<span class="strong"><strong> Re Trigger Delay</strong></span> to some value such as<code class="literal"> 0.2</code> in order to put less strain on the hardware.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Mobile Object Picker" src="graphics/image_1901_04_32.jpg" width="93"/></div><p>This action is found in<span class="strong"><strong> New Event</strong></span> |<span class="strong"><strong> Input</strong></span> |<span class="strong"><strong> Mobile Object Picker</strong></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id285"/>
