			<p>In the next section, you'll create a new playground, where you can type in the code presented in this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Understanding Swift playgrounds</h1>
			<p>Playgrounds<a id="_idIndexMarker047"/> are interactive coding environments. You type code in the left-hand pane, and the results are displayed immediately in the right-hand pane. It's a great way to experiment with code and to explore system APIs.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface. To learn more, visit this link: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API</a>.</p>
			<p>Let's start by creating a new playground and examining its user interface. Follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>To create a playground, launch Xcode and choose <strong class="bold">File </strong>|<strong class="bold"> New </strong>|<strong class="bold"> Playground...</strong> from the Xcode menu bar:<div><img src="img/Figure_2.1_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1: Xcode menu bar with File | New | Playground... selected&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1: Xcode menu bar with File | New | Playground... selected</p></li>
				<li>The template <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>screen appears.<strong class="bold"> iOS</strong> should already be selected. Choose <strong class="bold">Blank</strong> and click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_2.2_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2: Choose a template for your new playground: screen&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2: Choose a template for your new playground: screen</p></li>
				<li>Name your playground <code>SimpleValues</code> and save it anywhere you like. Click <strong class="bold">Create</strong> when done:<div><img src="img/Figure_2.3_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3: Save dialog box&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3: Save dialog box</p></li>
				<li>You should <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>see the playground on the screen:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.4_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4: Xcode playground user interface&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4: Xcode playground user interface</p>
			<p>As you can see, it's much simpler than an Xcode project. Let's look at the interface in more detail:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Navigator button (1)</strong> - Shows or hides the Navigator area.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Activity View (2)</strong> - Shows the current operation or status.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Library button (3)</strong> - Displays code snippets and other resources. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inspector button (4)</strong> - Shows or hides the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> area.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Navigator area (5)</strong> - Provides<a id="_idIndexMarker050"/> quick access to various parts of your project. The Project navigator is displayed by default.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Editor area (6)</strong> - You write code here.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Results area (7)</strong> - Provides immediate feedback to the code you write.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Play button (8)</strong> - Executes code from a selected line.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Border (9)</strong> - This border separates the <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> and <strong class="bold">Results</strong> areas. If you find that the results displayed in the <strong class="bold">Results</strong> area are truncated, drag the border to the left to increase its size.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Play/Stop button (10)</strong> - Executes or stops the execution of all code in the playground.</li>
				<li><code>print()</code> command.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Debug button (12)</strong> - Shows and hides the <strong class="bold">Debug</strong> area.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You may find the code in the playground too small and hard to read. Let's see how to make it larger in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Customizing fonts and colors</h2>
			<p>Xcode has<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> extensive customization options available. You can access them in the <strong class="bold">Preferences...</strong> menu. If you find that the text is small and hard to see, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Choose <strong class="bold">Preferences...</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Xcode</strong> menu to display the preferences window.</li>
				<li>In the preferences window, click <strong class="bold">Themes</strong> and choose <strong class="bold">Presentation (Light)</strong> to make your code larger and easier to read:<div><img src="img/Figure_2.5_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5: Xcode Preferences window with the Themes pane selected&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5: Xcode Preferences window with the Themes pane selected</p></li>
				<li>Close the preferences window to return to the playground. Note that the text in the playground is larger than before. You can also try the other themes if you wish.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that you've<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> customized the fonts and colors to your liking, let's see how to run code in a playground in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Running playground code</h2>
			<p>Your playground <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>already has an instruction in it. To execute the instruction, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button in the bottom-left corner of the playground. You may see the following dialog box:<div><img src="img/Figure_2.6_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6: Developer Tools Access dialog box&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6: Developer Tools Access dialog box</p></li>
				<li>Enter the <code>"Hello, playground"</code> displayed in the <strong class="bold">Results</strong> area:</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7: Playground showing "Hello, playground" in the Results area</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">You can use the keyboard shortcut <em class="italic">Command + Shift + Return</em> to run the code in your Playground.</p>
			<p>To prepare the playground for use in the remainder of this chapter, delete the <code>var greeting = "Hello, playground"</code> instruction from the playground. As you go along, type the code shown in this chapter into the playground, and if necessary, click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it.</p>
			<p>Let's dive into<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> the simple data types used in Swift in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Exploring data types</h1>
			<p>All programming<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> languages can store numbers, logic states, and words, and Swift is no different. Even if you're an experienced programmer, you may find that Swift represents these objects differently from other languages that you may be familiar with. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">For more information on data types, visit: <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html">https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html</a>.</p>
			<p>Let's walk through the Swift versions of <strong class="bold">integers</strong>, <strong class="bold">floating-point numbers</strong>, <strong class="bold">Booleans</strong>, and <strong class="bold">strings</strong>, in the next sections.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Representing integers</h2>
			<p>Let's <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>say you <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>want to store the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The number of restaurants in a city</li>
				<li>Passengers in an airplane</li>
				<li>Rooms in a hotel</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You would use integers, which are numbers without a fractional component (including negative numbers).</p>
			<p>Integers in Swift are represented by the <code>Int</code> type. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Representing floating-point numbers</h2>
			<p>Let's say <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>you <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>want to store the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pi (3.14159...)</li>
				<li>Absolute zero (-273.15 °C)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You would use floating-point numbers, which are numbers with a fractional component. </p>
			<p>The default type for floating-point numbers in Swift is <code>Double</code>, which uses 64 bits, including negative numbers. You can also use <code>Float</code>, which uses 32 bits, but <code>Double</code> is preferred.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Representing Booleans</h2>
			<p>Let's say<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> you <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>want to store answers to simple yes/no questions, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is it raining?</li>
				<li>Are there any available seats at the restaurant?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For this, you use Boolean values. </p>
			<p>Swift provides a <code>Bool</code> type that can either be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Representing strings</h2>
			<p>Let's say <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>you <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>want to store the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The name of a restaurant, such as "Bombay Palace"</li>
				<li>A job description, such as "Accountant" or "Programmer"</li>
				<li>A kind of fruit, such as "banana"</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You would use Swift's <code>String</code> type, which represents a sequence of characters, and is fully Unicode-compliant. This makes it easy to represent different fonts and languages. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">To learn more about Unicode, visit this link: <a href="https://home.unicode.org/basic-info/faq/">https://home.unicode.org/basic-info/faq/</a>.</p>
			<p>Now that you know how Swift represents these common data types, let's try them out in the<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> playground <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>you created earlier in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Using common data types in the playground</h2>
			<p>Anything <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>that <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>you type into a playground will be executed, and the results will appear in the <strong class="bold">Results</strong> area. Let's see what happens when you type in numbers, Boolean values, and strings into your playground and execute it. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Type the following code into the <code>//</code> in front of it is a <strong class="bold">comment</strong>. Comments are a great way to create notes or reminders to yourself and will be ignored by Xcode.</p></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run your code.</li>
				<li>Wait a few seconds. Xcode will evaluate your input and display results in the Results area, as follows:<pre>42
-23
 
3.14159
0.1
-273.15
 
true
false
 
"hello, world" 
"albatross"</pre><p>Note that comments do not appear in the Results area.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Cool! You<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> have<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> just created and run your first playground. Let's look at how to store different data types in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Exploring constants and variables</h1>
			<p>Now that you <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>know <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>about the simple data types that Swift supports, let's look at how to store them, so you can perform operations on them later.</p>
			<p>You can use <strong class="bold">constants</strong> or <strong class="bold">variables</strong> to store data. Both are containers that have a name, but a constant's value can only be set once and cannot be changed after it has been set, whereas a variable's value can be changed at any time.</p>
			<p>You must declare constants and variables before you use them. Constants are declared with the <code>let</code> keyword whereas variables are declared with the <code>var</code> keyword.</p>
			<p>Let's explore how constants and variables work by implementing them in your playground. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Add the following code to your playground to declare three constants:<pre>let theAnswerToTheUltimateQuestion = 42 
let pi = 3.14159
let myName = "Ahmad Sahar"</pre></li>
				<li>Click the <code>"Ahmad Sahar"</code>, is used to assign the value for <code>myName</code>. These are known as <strong class="bold">string literals</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>Add the following code after the constant declarations to declare three variables:<pre>var currentTemperatureInCelsius = 27 
var myAge = 50
var myLocation = "home"</pre><p>Similar to constants, a container is created and named in each case, and the assigned value stored.</p><p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">The stored values are displayed in the Results area.</p></li>
				<li>The value of a constant can't be changed once it is set. To test this, add the following code after the variable declarations:<pre>let isRaining = true
isRaining = false</pre><p>As you're<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> typing<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> the second line of code, a pop-up menu will appear with suggestions:</p><div><img src="img/Figure_2.8_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8: Autocomplete pop-up menu&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8: Autocomplete pop-up menu</p><p>Use the up and down arrow keys to choose the <code>isRaining</code> constant and press the <em class="italic">Tab</em> key to select it. This feature is<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> called <strong class="bold">autocomplete</strong> and helps to prevent typing mistakes when you're entering code.</p></li>
				<li>When you have finished typing, wait a few seconds. On the second line, you should see a red circle with a white dot in the middle appear:<div><img src="img/Figure_2.9_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9: Error notification&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9: Error notification</p><p>This means there is an error in your program, and Xcode thinks it can be fixed. The error appears because you are trying to assign a new value to a constant after its initial value has been set.</p></li>
				<li>Click the red <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>circle <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>to expand the error message. You should see the following box with a <strong class="bold">Fix</strong> button:<div><img src="img/Figure_2.10_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10: Expanded error notification&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10: Expanded error notification</p><p>Xcode tells you what the problem is (<strong class="bold">Cannot assign to value: 'isRaining' is a 'let' constant</strong>) and suggests a correction (<strong class="bold">Change 'let' to 'var' to make it mutable</strong>). </p></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Fix</strong> button.</li>
				<li>You should see that the <code>isRaining</code> constant declaration has been changed to a variable declaration:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.11_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11: Code with fix applied&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11: Code with fix applied</p>
			<p>Since a new value can be assigned to a variable after it has been created, the error is resolved. Do note, however, that the suggested correction might not be the best solution.</p>
			<p>If you look at the <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>code <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>you typed in, you might be wondering how Xcode knows the type of data stored in a variable or constant. You'll learn about how that is done in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Understanding type inference and type safety</h1>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>previous <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>section, you declared constants and variables and assigned values to them. Swift automatically determines the constant or variable type based on the value you supplied. This is called <strong class="bold">type inference</strong>. You can see the type of a constant or variable by holding down the <em class="italic">Option</em> key and clicking its name. To see this in action, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Add the following code to your playground to declare a string:<pre>let cuisine = "American"</pre></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it.</li>
				<li>Hold down the <em class="italic">Option</em> key and click <code>cuisine</code> to reveal the constant type. You should see the following:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.12_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12: Type declaration pop-up&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.12: Type declaration pop-up</p>
			<p>As you can see, <code>cuisine</code>'s type is <code>String</code>.</p>
			<p>What if you want to set a specific type for a variable or constant? You'll see how to do that<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> in <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Using type annotation to specify a type</h2>
			<p>You've seen <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>that Xcode tries to automatically determine the data type of a variable or constant based on the value provided. However, at times, you may wish to specify a type instead of letting Xcode do it for you. To do this, type a colon after a constant or variable name, followed by the desired type. This is known as <strong class="bold">type annotation</strong>.</p>
			<p>Add the following code to your playground to declare a variable with a specific type, and click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<pre>var restaurantRating: Double = 3</pre>
			<p>Here, you specified <code>restaurantRating</code> has a specific type, <code>Double</code>. Even though you assigned an integer to <code>restaurantRating</code>, it will be stored as a floating-point number.</p>
			<p>In the next section, you'll learn how Xcode helps you reduce the number of errors in your program by enforcing <strong class="bold">type safety</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Using type safety to check values</h2>
			<p>Swift is a <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>type-safe language. It checks to see whether you're assigning values of the correct type to variables and flags mismatched types as errors. Let's see how this works by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Add the following code to your playground to assign a string to <code>restaurantRating</code>: <pre>restaurantRating = "Good"</pre></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run the code.</li>
				<li>You should see a red circle with an <strong class="bold">x</strong> inside it. The exclamation mark means Xcode can't suggest a fix for this. Click on the red circle.</li>
				<li>Since you are trying to assign a string to a variable of type <code>Double</code>, the following error message is displayed:<div><img src="img/Figure_2.13_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.13: Expanded error notification with no fix&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.13: Expanded error notification with no fix</p></li>
				<li>Comment out the line by typing <code>//</code> before it as shown:<pre>// restaurantRating = "Good"</pre><p>The red circle disappears as there are no more errors in your program.</p><p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">Selecting lines of code and typing <em class="italic">Command + /</em> will comment them out.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that you <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>know how to store data in constants and variables, let's look at how to perform operations on them in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Exploring operators</h1>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> perform arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations in Swift. <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">For more information on operators, visit <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html">https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html</a>.</p>
			<p>Let's look at each operator type in more detail. You'll start with arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>division) in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Using arithmetic operators</h2>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>perform mathematical operations on integer and floating-point numbers by using the standard arithmetic operators shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.14_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.14: Arithmetic operators&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.14: Arithmetic operators</p>
			<p>Let's see how these operators are used. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Add the following code to add arithmetic operations to your playground:<pre>let sum = 23 + 20
let result = 32 - sum
let total = result * 5
let divide = total / 10</pre></li>
				<li>Click the <code>43</code>, <code>-11</code>, <code>-55</code>, and <code>-5</code>, respectively. Note that 55 divided by 10 returns 5 instead of 5.5, as both numbers are integers.</p></li>
				<li>Operators can only work with operands of the same type. Enter the following code and run it to see what happens if the operands are of different types: <pre>let a = 12
let b = 12.0 
let c = a + b</pre><p>You'll get an error message, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are different types. Note that Xcode can't fix this automatically, so it does not display any fix-it suggestions.</p></li>
				<li>To fix the error, modify the program as follows:<pre>let c = Double(a) + b</pre><p><code>Double(a)</code> gets the value stored in <code>a</code> and creates a floating-point number from it. Both operands are now of the same type, and now you can add the value in <code>b</code> to it. The value stored in <code>c</code> is <code>24.0</code>, and <code>24</code> will be displayed in the Results area.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that you <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>know how to use arithmetic operators, you'll look at compound assignment operators (<code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code> and <code>/=</code>) in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Using compound assignment operators</h2>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> perform an operation on a value and assign the result to a variable using compound assignment operators shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.15_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.15: Compound assignment operators&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.15: Compound assignment operators</p>
			<p>Let's see how these operators are used. Add the following code to your playground and click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<pre>var aa = 1
aa += 2
aa -= 1</pre>
			<p>The <code>a += 2</code> expression is shorthand for <code>a = a + 2</code>, so the value in <code>a</code> is now <code>1 + 2</code>, and <code>3</code> will be assigned to <code>a</code>. In the same way, <code>a -= 1</code> is shorthand for <code>a = a - 1</code>, so the value in <code>a</code> is now <code>3 - 1</code>, and <code>2</code> will be assigned to <code>a</code>.</p>
			<p>Now that you <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>are familiar with compound assignment operators, let's look at comparison operators (<code>==</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=,</code> and <code>&lt;=</code>) in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Using comparison operators</h2>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>compare one value to another using comparison operators, and the result will be true or false. You can use the following comparison operators:</p>

			<p>Let's see how these operators are used. Add the following code to your playground and click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<pre>1 == 1 
2 != 1 
2 &gt; 1    
1 &lt; 2    
1 &gt;= 1 
2 &lt;= 1</pre>
			<p>Let's see how this works:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>1 == 1</code> returns <code>true</code> because 1 is equal to 1.</li>
				<li><code>2 != 1</code> returns <code>true</code> because 2 is not equal to 1.</li>
				<li><code>2 &gt; 1</code> returns <code>true</code> because 2 is greater than 1.</li>
				<li><code>1 &lt; 2</code> returns <code>true</code> because 1 is less than 2.</li>
				<li><code>1 &gt;= 1</code> returns <code>true</code> because 1 is greater than or equal to 1.</li>
				<li><code>2 &lt;= 1</code> returns <code>false</code> because 2 is not less than or equal to 1.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The returned<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> Boolean values will be displayed in the <strong class="bold">Results</strong> area.</p>
			<p>What happens if you want to check more than one condition? That's where logical operators (<strong class="bold">AND</strong>, <strong class="bold">OR</strong> and <strong class="bold">NOT</strong>) come in. You'll study those in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Using logical operators</h2>
			<p>Logical <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>operators are handy when you deal with two or more conditions. For example, if you are at a convenience store, you can pay for items if you have cash or a credit card. <strong class="bold">OR </strong>is the logical operator in this case.</p>
			<p>You can use the following logical operators:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.17: Logical operators</p>
			<p>To see how these operators are used, add the following code to your playground and click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<pre>(1 == 1) &amp;&amp; (2 == 2) 
(1 == 1) &amp;&amp; (2 != 2) 
(1 == 1) || (2 == 2) 
(1 == 1) || (2 != 2) 
(1 != 1) || (2 != 2) 
!(1 == 1)</pre>
			<p>Let's see how this works:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>(1 == 1) &amp;&amp; (2 == 2)</code> returns <code>true</code> as both operands are <code>true</code>, so <code>true</code> AND <code>true</code> returns <code>true</code>.</li>
				<li><code>(1 == 1) &amp;&amp; (2 != 2)</code> returns <code>false</code> as one operand is <code>false</code>, so <code>true</code> AND <code>false</code> returns <code>false</code>.</li>
				<li><code>(1 == 1) || (2 == 2)</code> returns <code>true</code> as both operands are <code>true</code>, so <code>true</code> OR <code>true</code> returns <code>true</code>.</li>
				<li><code>(1 == 1) || (2 != 2)</code> returns <code>true</code> as one operand is <code>true</code>, so <code>true</code> OR <code>false</code> returns <code>true</code>.</li>
				<li><code>(1 != 1) || (2 != 2)</code> returns <code>false</code> as both operands are <code>false</code>, so <code>false</code> OR <code>false</code> returns <code>false</code>.</li>
				<li><code>!(1 == 1)</code> returns <code>false</code> as <code>1==1</code> is <code>true</code>, so NOT <code>true</code> returns <code>false</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The returned <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>Boolean values will be displayed in the Results area.</p>
			<p>So far, you've only worked with numbers. In the next section, you'll see how you can perform operations on words and sentences, which are stored as strings using Swift's <code>String</code> type.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Performing string operations</h2>
			<p>As you have<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> seen earlier, a string is a series of characters. They are represented by the <code>String</code> type, and they are fully Unicode-compliant.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">For more information on strings, visit: <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/StringsAndCharacters.html">https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/StringsAndCharacters.html</a>.</p>
			<p>Let's learn about some common string operations. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">You can join two strings together using the <code>+</code> operator. Add the following code to your playground and click the <code>"Good"</code> and <code>" Morning"</code> are joined together and <code>"Good Morning"</code> is displayed in the Results area.</p></li>
				<li>You can combine strings with constants and variables of other types by <code>rating</code> constant contains <code>3.5</code>, a value of type <code>Double</code>. Putting <code>rating</code> in between the brackets of <code>String()</code> gets the value stored in <code>rating</code> and creates a new string based on it, <code>"3.5"</code>, which is combined with the string in the <code>ratingResult</code> variable, returning the string <code>"The restaurant rating is 3.5</code><code>"</code>.</p></li>
				<li>There is a <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>simpler <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>way of combining strings, called <code>\(</code>" and "<code>)</code>" in a string. Enter the following code and run it:<pre>ratingResult = "The restaurant rating is \(rating)"</pre><p>As in the previous example, the value in <code>rating</code> is used to create a new string,  <code>"3.5"</code>, returning the string <code>"The restaurant rating is 3.5"</code>.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Thus far, you can see the results of your instructions in the Results area. However, when you're writing your app using Xcode, you won't have access to the Results area that you see in your playground. To display the contents of variables and constants while your program is running, you'll learn how to print them to the Debug area in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Using the print() statement</h1>
			<p>As you have <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>seen in <a href="B17469_01_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a><em class="italic">, Getting Familiar with Xcode</em>, an Xcode project does not have a Results area that a playground has, but both project and playground have a Debug area. Using the <code>print()</code> statement will print anything between the brackets to the Debug area.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">The <code>print()</code> statement is a <strong class="bold">function</strong>. You'll learn more about functions in <a href="B17469_06_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor094"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Functions and Closures</em>.</p>
			<p>Add the following code to your playground and click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<pre>print(ratingResult)</pre>
			<p>You'll see the value of <code>ratingResult</code> appear in the Debug area:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.18_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 2.18: Debug area showing result of print() statement&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.18: Debug area showing result of print() statement</p>
			<p>When you're just starting out, feel free to use as many <code>print()</code> statements as you like. It's a really<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> good way to understand what is happening in your program.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this lesson, you learned how to create and use playground files, which allow you to explore and experiment with Swift. </p>
			<p>You saw how Swift represents different types of data, and how to use constants and variables. This enables you to store numbers, Boolean values, and strings in your program</p>
			<p>You also learned about type inference, type annotation, and type safety, which help you to write code concisely and with fewer errors. </p>
			<p>You looked at how to perform operations on numbers and strings, which lets you perform simple data processing tasks. </p>
			<p>You learned how to fix errors, and how to print to the Debug area, which is useful when you're trying to find and fix errors in the programs that you write.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you'll look at <strong class="bold">conditionals</strong> and <strong class="bold">optionals</strong>. Conditionals deal with making logical choices in your program, and optionals deal with cases where a variable may or may not have a value.</p>
