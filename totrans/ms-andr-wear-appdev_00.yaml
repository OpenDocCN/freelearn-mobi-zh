- en: This book is intended for developers working on mobile, desktop, or web platforms
    interested in learning how to build apps for wearable devices, also known as wear
    apps. Furthermore, you may already have apps featured on the Google Play store
    and are looking to provide Android Wear support for your existing Android apps.
    If either of these statements is true, then yes, this book is for you.

- en: Our primary goal in this book is to provide you, the reader, with a solid understanding
    of the philosophy, thought process, development details, and methodologies involved
    in building well-designed and robust Android Wear applications. We'll cover the
    advantages and the disadvantages of the wearable computing paradigm, and in doing
    so, we hope to provide a strong foundation for building wearable apps to meet
    practical and real-world use cases.

- en: We will explore a wide range of concepts and features, from basic to medium
    to advanced, with varying degrees of complexity. Code samples accompanying each
    chapter are intended to give you hands-on knowledge of using the tools, libraries,
    SDKs, and other relevant technology needed to build Android Wear apps.
