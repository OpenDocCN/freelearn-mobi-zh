    It's a multiplatform physics library that is broadly used across the gaming community.
    You'll find it really easy to work with it and get nice-looking physics pretty
    quickly, but this doesn't mean you have to create another *Angry Birds* clone,

    meter on the simulation is equivalent to 38 points in our world coordinates. Since
    we're using a main character sprite that is 64 points tall, we can say that our
    character could be about 1.67 meters tall. So, 65 / 1.67 is about 38\. That's
    the calculation needed in order to find that scale.

    displayed on screen can be pretty handy. If you pass a layer to the `initialize`

    objects (bodies) that behave according to physics laws. The term `body` is highly
    based on physics literature, where all the objects that interact are called bodies.

    They don''t move on their own, and they are not affected by gravity or collisions.
    Keep in mind that static bodies are able to collide with other objects, but they
    will not move or change as a result of the collision, just as the other objects
    (if they''re not static). We''ll use static bodies as platforms in our game, for
    our player to stand on.'

    to create objects that are more complex. In this example, we're creating a rectangular
    object that has a width equal to the screen size and height equal to 100\. The
    way we define these rectangles follows the convention of the rectangles on images,

  prefs: []

- en: The first method we're going to use will make our character run. It will be
    called when we press the *A* or *D* keys, moving left or right respectively. We'll
    pass it two parameters, `direction` (`-1` for left, `1` for right) and `keyDown`,
    which is a Boolean value that tells us if the player is pressing the key.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing we do is use the `direction` parameter in combination with `setScl`
    (used to scale objects). The idea is that if you scale a sprite by a negative
    factor, it flips in the direction of the scaled component, so what we're doing
    here is telling our sprite to face left or right according to what key the player
    pressed.
