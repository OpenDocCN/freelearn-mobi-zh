We have stepped through each component of the game development process in Swift and we are finally ready to share our hard work with the world. We need to prepare our project for publication by finishing the assets associated with it: the assorted app icons, the launch screen, and the screenshots for the App Store. Then, we will fill out the description and information for our app in iTunes Connect. Finally, we will use Xcode to upload a production archive build and submit it to the Apple review process. We are very close to seeing our game in the App Store!</p><p>While I can show you the general path you can use to submit your app, this process is constantly changing as Apple updates iTunes Connect. In addition, every app has unique aspects that may require a variation on the path I demonstrate in this chapter. I encourage you to browse Apple's official documentation in the iOS Developer Library and refer to Stack Overflow for updated answers. You can locate the iOS Developer Library by browsing to <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios</a>.</p><p>Topics in this chapter include:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Finalizing assets: app icons and the launch screen</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Finalizing iTunes Connect information</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring pricing</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Uploading our project from Xcode</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Submitting for review in iTunes Connect</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec84"/>Finalizing assets</h1></div></div></div><p>There <a id="id370" class="indexterm"/>are several peripheral assets we need before we can publish our game. We will create a set of app icons, redesign the launch screen, and take screenshots for each device we support for the App Store previews.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec102"/>Adding app icons</h2></div></div></div><p>Our app <a id="id371" class="indexterm"/>requires multiple sizes of our app icon to display correctly in the App Store and the various iOS devices we support. You can find a sample icon set in the provided assets bundle, in the <code class="literal">Icon</code> folder.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip17"/>Tip</h3><p>You should design your icon to be 1024 pixels wide by 1024 pixels tall and then resize down for the other variations. Make sure to check each variation to ensure it looks good after resizing. You will upload this large size directly to iTunes Connect later in the chapter.</p></div></div><p>The best way to integrate your icons into your project is to use the <code class="literal">Images.xcassets</code> asset bundle, preconfigured for app icons, that comes along with new projects. We will drag and drop our icons into this file to bring them into the project.</p><p>Follow these steps to add our icons to the project:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In Xcode, open the <code class="literal">Images.xcassets</code> file and locate the <strong>AppIcon</strong> image set in the left pane.</li><li class="listitem">Drag and drop the images from the assets bundle into the corresponding icon slots. You can drag your files in as a group and Xcode will process them into the correct slots. You can ignore the icon slots for Settings icons, since our app does not integrate with iOS settings. When you are finished, your icon image set will look something like this:<div><img src="img/Image_B04532_11_01.jpg" alt="Adding app icons"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Go into your general project settings by clicking on your project in the project navigator. Locate the <strong>App Icons Source</strong> setting and make sure it is set to <strong>AppIcon</strong> to use the image bundle, as shown here:<div><img src="img/Image_B04532_11_02.jpg" alt="Adding app icons"/></div></li></ol></div><p>We are <a id="id372" class="indexterm"/>finished adding our icons in Xcode. We will need to upload a few more icon sizes to iTunes Connect later. You can run your project on a real device to see your new icons in action.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec103"/>Designing the launch screen</h2></div></div></div><p>When <a id="id373" class="indexterm"/>a user taps your icon on their device, iOS shows your app's launch screen as an extremely fast-loading simple preview. This creates the illusion that your app loads almost instantly. The player gets immediate feedback from their tap while your app actually loads in the background. This is not the place to add logos, branding, or information of any kind. The goal is to create a very simple screen that looks like your app before the content is in place. For Pierre Penguin, we will implement a simple blank sky blue background that looks like the main menu before it has any content.</p><p>Follow these steps to set up your sky blue launch screen:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open the <code class="literal">LaunchScreen.xib</code> file in Xcode. You will see the launch screen open in the interface builder.</li><li class="listitem">Select each preexisting text element and delete each one with the <em>Delete</em> key on your keyboard.</li><li class="listitem">Select the entire frame by clicking anywhere in the white space of the launch screen.</li><li class="listitem">Make sure you have your Utilities bar open on the right hand side of Xcode, and open the <strong>Attributes Inspector</strong>, as demonstrated here:<div><img src="img/Image_B04532_11_03.jpg" alt="Designing the launch screen"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Locate the background color setting in the right bar, then click on the existing white color option to open a color selection window.</li><li class="listitem">Choose<a id="id374" class="indexterm"/> the color sliders tab, and enter the RGB value <code class="literal">102</code>, <code class="literal">153</code>, <code class="literal">242</code>, as shown here:<div><img src="img/Image_B04532_11_04.jpg" alt="Designing the launch screen"/></div></li><li class="listitem">You should see the entire frame turn the sky blue color from our game.</li><li class="listitem">Next, enter your general settings by clicking the project name in the project navigator. As you did before for the app icons, make sure the <strong>Launch Screen File</strong> setting is <strong>LaunchScreen</strong>:<div><img src="img/Image_B04532_11_05.jpg" alt="Designing the launch screen"/></div></li></ol></div><p>Perfect! When we run our app, we will see the sky blue color immediately, providing a smoother<a id="id375" class="indexterm"/> transition between the home screen and our fully loaded app.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec104"/>Taking screenshots for each supported device</h2></div></div></div><p>Fun<a id="id376" class="indexterm"/> screenshots will make your game stand out in the App Store. I created some sample screenshots for Pierre Penguin in the assets bundle's <code class="literal">Screenshots</code> folder. You will need to create separate screenshots for each iOS device you want to support.</p><p>Screenshots must be JPG or PNG files. You can use my example screenshots as templates for each size of screenshot you need, or follow this table:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec88"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Many indie developers struggle with the final steps of publishing their games. If you are ready to publish a game, you are doing a great job! In this chapter, we created app icons and our launch screen, finalized our App Store marketing information in iTunes Connect, used Xcode to archive and upload our game, and submitted our game to Apple for review. You should now be confident in your ability to publish your games to the App Store.</p><p>We accomplished a great deal in the course of this book: we assembled a complete Swift game from a new project template to publication. As we go our separate ways, I wish you tremendous luck in your future game development endeavors. My hope is that you are now confident in starting your own game projects with Swift. I look forward to seeing your creations in the App Store!</p></div></body></html>
