<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch11lvl1sec79" class="calibre1"/>Introducing Xcode 6</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Xcode 6 <a id="id384" class="calibre1"/>was announced by Apple at the<a id="id385" class="calibre1"/> <strong class="calibre2">Worldwide Developers Conference</strong> (<strong class="calibre2">WWDC</strong>) on June 2, 2014 and it was officially released on September 17, 2014. Xcode 6 improved a lot with regards to features and tools for iOS and Mac developers as it has support for the new Swift programming language created by Apple and announced in 2014.</p><p class="calibre8">Xcode 6 also includes new features such as live rendering within Interface Builder where your handwritten UI code is displayed within the UI canvas and any change is also instantly reflected when you type in your code. It also has a new view debugging tool that you can use to help you see your UI layers in a 3D visualization so that you can understand the composition of your interface and see and identify any clipped or overlapped views.</p><p class="calibre8">With Apple releasing newer devices every year with different screen sizes, having to support multiple screen devices is not an easy task to do. However, Xcode 6 now has new features that are aimed at reducing the tedium of developing iOS apps for multiple screens. So, let's dig into this chapter and look at the new tools that Apple has provided for us.</p><p class="calibre8">In this entire chapter, we <a id="id386" class="calibre1"/>will devote the following paragraphs to examining the internals and new features that are present in Xcode 6.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch11lvl1sec80" class="calibre1"/>What's new in storyboard</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Xcode 6 introduces a<a id="id387" class="calibre1"/> few new features with regards to storyboards and Interface Builder. Ever since the introduction of Xcode 4, storyboard allows you to link up your screen using a visual interface, describe the transition between the various screens, and have a good conceptual overview of all the screens since they are all placed into a single file. Storyboards have been an important tool for programmers, developers, and designers to create interfaces easily and link them up using a GUI. This is especially useful for designers as it allows them to overcome their fear of writing code, and storyboard allows them to create intuitive interfaces easily.</p><p class="calibre8">Similarly, with the introduction of Xcode 6, there have been new additions and changes to Storyboard. A few of the new additions are:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Allowing storyboard or the NIB file to replace launch images</li><li class="listitem">Universal storyboard</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">Now, let's expand more on the two new features in Xcode 6, which I mentioned earlier.</p></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch11lvl2sec42" class="calibre1"/>Allowing storyboard or the NIB file to replace launch images</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">When <a id="id388" class="calibre1"/>an iOS application is busy loading its initial first screen, the iOS (operating system) will show a static image, which is inserted into the application by the app developer. For an optimal effect, the launch image should resemble the user interface of the application. More information about launch images can be found on Apple's website at <a class="calibre1" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/LaunchImages.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/LaunchImages.html</a>, where it mentions this:</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote1"><p class="calibre26"><em class="calibre9">"A launch file or image provides a simple placeholder image that iOS displays when your app starts up. The placeholder image gives users the impression that your app is fast and responsive because it appears instantly and is quickly replaced by the first screen of your app. Every app must supply a launch file or at least one static image.</em></p><p class="calibre26"><em class="calibre9">In iOS 8 and later, you can create a XIB or storyboard file instead of a static launch image. When you create a launch file in Interface Builder, you use size classes to define different layouts for different display environments and you use Auto Layout to make minor adjustments. Using size classes and Auto Layout means that you can create a single launch file that looks good on all devices and display environments."</em></p></blockquote></div><p class="calibre8">Before iOS 8 and Xcode 6, developers had to provide launch images for each screen size, which can cover iPad, iPhones 4S, iPhone 5S, and so on. If your application is a universal application, that means you need to provide multiple versions of the launch images to support the various devices. But now with the introduction of using storyboards as launch images, you can use Auto Layout to create a single launch storyboard and this launch storyboard can be used as the launch image of all the devices that you are supporting. This is a very handy time-saving methods as this means that you do not need to create multiple launch images for various screen sizes anymore.</p><p class="calibre8">So, in the <a id="id389" class="calibre1"/>next few pages, we will go through a short introduction to using storyboards as launch images and you will appreciate this additional functionality that has been added into Xcode 6 for the sake of all developers. Do note that this function only works on iOS 8 and not on iOS 7. So, if you are targeting devices using iOS 7, then using storyboards as launch images will not work for you and you need to revert back to the old method of using static images. However, considering this, most iOS users tend to upgrade their OS whenever a new version is released. From now on, you should be using storyboards as launch images often. However, do keep in mind that if you need to support iOS 7, you can use launch images as a fallback for devices running iOS 7, and yet use launch storyboards for devices running iOS 8. So, let's get going and I will walk you through this new nifty feature available in Xcode 6.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch11lvl3sec01" class="calibre1"/>Launching images from your app</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">For this section, we <a id="id390" class="calibre1"/>will create a simple app to load a storyboard as a launch image. So, let's start, shall we?</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">First, we will create our project. For this tutorial, we will use a single view application after selecting <strong class="calibre2">File</strong> | <strong class="calibre2">New Project</strong>:<div><img src="img/00053.jpeg" alt="Launching images from your app" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre23"> </p><p class="calibre25">You will <a id="id391" class="calibre1"/>also see the following screen:</p><div><img src="img/00054.jpeg" alt="Launching images from your app" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre23"> </p><p class="calibre25">Then, we <a id="id392" class="calibre1"/>need to create a storyboard that will be the first image that the user sees when they launch the app, so we need to create a new storyboard and call it <code class="email">launch.storyboard</code>. Do note that we need to add a view controller and can add other controls such as UILabels to our launch storyboard:</p><div><img src="img/00055.jpeg" alt="Launching images from your app" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre23"> </p></li><li class="listitem" value="2">Next, we need <a id="id393" class="calibre1"/>to click on our project, which is named <strong class="calibre2">LaunchApplication</strong> and then set the <strong class="calibre2">Launch Screen File</strong> option to <code class="email">launch.storyboard</code>, which is the storyboard that we just created:<div><img src="img/00056.jpeg" alt="Launching images from your app" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre23"> </p></li><li class="listitem" value="3">To verify, we can go to <code class="email">info.plist</code> and look for this key: <strong class="calibre2">Launch screen interface file</strong>.

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch11lvl2sec43" class="calibre1"/>Universal storyboards</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Now, let's move<a id="id397" class="calibre1"/> on to the next cool feature of Xcode 6 and that is universal storyboard. Universal storyboards means that your storyboard will be able to display the UI elements such as <code class="email">UITextfields</code> and <code class="email">UIButtons</code> in the correct position regardless of whether it is viewed with and iPad, iPhone 6+, and so on. So, you can create one storyboard and use it for iPad, iPhones, and other devices. The universal applications, which are applications that can be downloaded once and then run equally well on iPhones and iPads, are now becoming the norm in the iTunes App Store. There used to be the issue of generating different set of layouts for iPhone, iPads, retina devices, and non-retina devices. However, with the introduction of Auto Layout, it has made life easier for developers everywhere and Xcode 6 has made it easier for us with the addition of universal storyboards. With universal storyboards, Xcode 6 now allows us to easily see how our layouts will look with devices of different resolution after we have used Auto Layout to create the user interface layout.</p><p class="calibre8">To activate <a id="id398" class="calibre1"/>universal storyboards, we just need a few simple steps and use our Xcode project created to launch images to show you the simple steps we need. Do note that this feature will only work on iOS 8.</p><p class="calibre8">First, we need to select our <strong class="calibre2">View Controller</strong> in <code class="email">Main.storyboard</code> and click the file inspector icon on the right of our screen and then make sure that <strong class="calibre2">Use Size Classes</strong> is checked:</p><div><img src="img/00060.jpeg" alt="Universal storyboards" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre8">Next, you will <a id="id399" class="calibre1"/>notice that at the bottom of your storyboard, there is <a id="id400" class="calibre1"/>an icon that you can click, which you can drag and resize to simulate how your Auto Layout user interface will look based on various screen layouts such as iPad portrait, iPhone landscape, and so on. So, feel free to click on it and move it around to see how your layouts will look and then adjust it according to your preference and specifications:</p><div><img src="img/00061.jpeg" alt="Universal storyboards" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch11lvl1sec81" class="calibre1"/>Debugging in Xcode 6</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">As you can see, Xcode 6<a id="id401" class="calibre1"/> has added some nifty new tools for us, developers, to aid us in our work. However, not only this, debugging is easier now with some additional <a id="id402" class="calibre1"/>goodies that are now part of Xcode 6. Here are a few of the debugging goodies that are provided:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">View hierarchy debugger</li><li class="listitem">Debug gauges</li><li class="listitem">Enhanced queue debugging</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">Out of the list of <a id="id403" class="calibre1"/>additional debugging goodies, the <a id="id404" class="calibre1"/>view hierarchy debugger is the one that will prove most useful in terms of impact. Prior to Xcode 6, if you wanted to see the view hierarchy of your application, you had to use plugins such as Spark Inspector, Reveal, and so on. However, with the release of Xcode 6, view hierarchy visualization is now officially supported and you will get the full power of the view hierarchy in Xcode 6.</p><p class="calibre8">To <a id="id405" class="calibre1"/>use the <a id="id406" class="calibre1"/>view hierarchy debugger in Xcode 6, you need to make sure that your application is currently running, then you need to click the debug view hierarchy icon at the bottom of your, Xcode as shown, here and the button will have mouseover text called <strong class="calibre2">Debug View Hierarchy</strong> when you move over the icon:</p><div><img src="img/00062.jpeg" alt="Debugging in Xcode 6" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre8">When you click on that icon, you will see a spinning <strong class="calibre2">UIActivityIndicator</strong> appear for a few seconds before an image of your current view appears. Then you can just drag up, down, left, and right to rotate your view along a 3D axis to see the image they lines up, as shown here:</p><div><img src="img/00063.jpeg" alt="Debugging in Xcode 6" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre8">The <a id="id407" class="calibre1"/>view hierarchy debugger <a id="id408" class="calibre1"/>will have a few options, as shown here, which you can use to aid your debugging:</p><div><img src="img/00064.jpeg" alt="Debugging in Xcode 6" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre8">Starting from left to right, the following table shows what the various buttons do:</p><div><table border="1" class="calibre13"><colgroup class="calibre14"><col class="calibre15"/><col class="calibre15"/><col class="calibre15"/></colgroup><thead class="calibre16"><tr class="calibre17"><th valign="bottom" class="calibre18">

The typical scenario when you will use this network activity gauge is when you need to track the amount of data being sent and received if you need to do network optimization, plus see the remote IP address and port number so that you can have an idea of where the device is connecting to. </p><p class="calibre8">These will be useful if you want to minimize the amount of network traffic being sent and using the network activity gauge will be the first place you should look:</p><div><img src="img/00070.jpeg" alt="Debug gauges" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre8">The <a id="id413" class="calibre1"/>disk activity debug gauge<a id="id414" class="calibre1"/> will show real-time data of all the reads and writes that your <a id="id415" class="calibre1"/>application is doing to disk. It also gives information on all open files coupled with a log of the disk I/O activity for you to look at, which you can see in the following screenshot. If you are developing applications that do large read and writes to disk and are experiencing erratic disk read and write failures, this disk activity debug gauge will be a enormous boon to you as it will tell you the size of the read and write activities. This is a great tool for you so that you can use these figures to track how much data you are actually reading and writing to disk, which will in turn help you to get a better picture of your situation in order to fix your problems:</p><div><img src="img/00071.jpeg" alt="Debug gauges" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch11lvl1sec82" class="calibre1"/>What's new in Interface Builder</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Interface Builder<a id="id416" class="calibre1"/> has few functions<a id="id417" class="calibre1"/> that are new in Xcode 6 and they are:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Live rendering</li><li class="listitem">Size classes</li><li class="listitem">Preview assistant</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">Live rendering functions<a id="id418" class="calibre1"/> in exactly the same way as its<a id="id419" class="calibre1"/> name suggests. So, what live rendering does is display and render custom objects such as custom buttons, fonts, and so on in your Xcode IDE without building a line of code. So, what this means is that when you update your code for your custom objects, the Interface Builder design canvas will automatically update itself with the new look that you have just entered in the editor without requiring you to build and run your project to see it on the simulator or device. Previously, you had to run your app to see the changes that you did to custom objects, which are elements such as <code class="email">UIButtons</code>, <code class="email">fonts</code>, and so on that you created in storyboard or programmatically and which have a customized look to them. However, now, Apple has made it easier for us by introducing live rendering into Xcode 6 as it saves us time for development by not letting us waste time in building and running our code to see custom objects during the course of your development. You can expect to build and run your code thousands or even millions of times, so every second saved doing unnecessary building will save you hours of development time down the line.</p><p class="calibre8">One last thing that is new in Xcode 6 is the concept of <a id="id420" class="calibre1"/>size classes; we <a id="id421" class="calibre1"/>briefly covered size classes earlier on when I introduced the concept of universal storyboards. To explain in more detail, size classes for iOS 8 enables a developer to create and design a single universal storyboard with customized layouts for both iPad and iPhone. With the introduction of size classes, you can define common views and constraints once and then add your own custom variations for each supported device screen and form factor.</p><p class="calibre8">Finally, one more exciting feature in Xcode 6 is the <a id="id422" class="calibre1"/>preview assistant. The <a id="id423" class="calibre1"/>preview assistant allows you to preview and see how your layout looks one beside the other in different devices/targets. So, you can see your layout as it will appear on an iPad or iPhone 4S next to each other. To activate preview assistant, you need to click on the <strong class="calibre2">Show Assistant Editor</strong> button on the top right to activate Assistant Editor, then when Assistant Editor appears, click on the icon with the two interlinked icons, which will reveal a menu item called <strong class="calibre2">Preview</strong>. Click on the <strong class="calibre2">Preview</strong> item and select the storyboard that you wish to preview as shown here:</p><div><img src="img/00072.jpeg" alt="What's new in Interface Builder" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre8">Next, you can see a <strong class="calibre2">+</strong> icon in the bottom-left corner. Click on it and you will see a list of iOS devices for different screen sizes, such as iPhone 4 inch, iPhone 4.7 inch, and so on.</p><div><img src="img/00073.jpeg" alt="What's new in Interface Builder" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre8">These correspond to the various iOS screen devices that you wish to preview. So, click on a device and a canvas showing that screen size will appear, and in that canvas, you can see how your selected storyboard looks for that screen size. So, without building and selecting your targeted simulator, Xcode 6 allows you to preview how your layout looks without wasting a few seconds of build time. This features well for storyboard and XIB files too. To sum up, the steps to use<a id="id424" class="calibre1"/> preview assistant are as follows:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Click on <strong class="calibre2">Show Assistant Editor</strong> on the top right to activate Assistant Editor.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Click on the icon with the two interlinked icons to reveal a menu called <strong class="calibre2">Preview</strong>.</li><li class="listitem" value="3">Click on the <strong class="calibre2">Preview</strong> item and select the storyboard you wish to preview.</li><li class="listitem" value="4">Click on the <strong class="calibre2">+</strong> icon in the bottom-left corner to select a list of iOS devices to see how your storyboard <a id="id425" class="calibre1"/>will look in that selected device screen.</li></ol><div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch11lvl1sec83" class="calibre1"/>Playground for Swift</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Apple <a id="id426" class="calibre1"/>announced the programming language Swift in 2014 during WWDC and in line with that, Xcode 6 comes with a new feature called Playground where you can have an interactive work area to write Swift code and get live feedback in Xcode. This makes writing Swift code simple and fun as you can input in a single line of code and see the results immediately. And if your code iterates through a loop, you can see its movement via the timeline assistant. The timeline assistant also displays your variables in a graph and draws each step when a view is composed. To give you a better understanding of playground, let's try it out via a simple project:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">To start off, we need to create a new playground by selecting the <strong class="calibre2">File</strong> | <strong class="calibre2">New</strong> | <strong class="calibre2">Playground</strong> menu and then giving our playground a name as you can see here. For this project, let's call our playground project <code class="email">MyPlayground</code>:<div><img src="img/00074.jpeg" alt="Playground for Swift" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre23"> </p></li><li class="listitem" value="2">Next, a screen will appear where you can enter Swift code and the results will be shown instantly on the right side. To test it, try entering the following code:<div><pre class="programlisting">import UIKit

var str = "Hello, playground"
var name = "Gib"

var sum = 0
for i in 0...10
{
    sum += i
}

sum</pre></div></li><li class="listitem" value="3">Next, you will see the<a id="id427" class="calibre1"/> results of your Swift input on the right side of the screen, which you can see here:<div><img src="img/00075.jpeg" alt="Playground for Swift" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre23"> </p><p class="calibre25">Now, that looks pretty cool as the real-time feedback helps by telling you what the output is and provides validation of your code. This can be useful for developers who want to test an algorithm without building their code or for you to display drawing code and see it immediately.</p></li></ol><div></div><p class="calibre8">Although playground sounds good, there are some limitations<a id="id428" class="calibre1"/> that you have to note for playground. Here is a list of limitations of what cannot be done with playground:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">It cannot be used for user interaction</li><li class="listitem">Playground only works on the simulator and not on the device</li><li class="listitem">Customer libraries and frameworks cannot be imported as only system libraries and frameworks can be used</li></ul></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch11lvl1sec84" class="calibre1"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">As you can see, Xcode is a big step forward in the right direction for developers with the introduction of new tools such as view hierarchy debugger, preview editor, and the addition of new functionalities such as allowing storyboards and NIBs to be used as launch images for your application instead of just static images. With all these new components to play with, Apple has made it much easier and better for developers to create and code cool projects with ease and reduce the effort to do so.
