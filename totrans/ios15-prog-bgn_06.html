		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Chapter 5</em>: Collection Types</h1>
			<p>You've learned quite a lot at this point! You can now create a program that stores data in constants or variables and performs operations on them, and you can control the flow using conditionals and loops. But so far, you've mostly been storing single values.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn ways to store collections of values. Swift has three collection types: <strong class="bold">arrays</strong>, which store an ordered list of values; <strong class="bold">dictionaries</strong>, which store an unordered list of key-value pairs; and <strong class="bold">sets</strong>, which store an unordered list of values.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you'll have learned how to create arrays, dictionaries, and sets, and how to perform operations on them.</p>
			<p>The following topics will be covered: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding arrays</li>
				<li>Understanding dictionaries</li>
				<li>Understanding sets</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">To find out more about arrays, dictionaries, and sets, visit <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html">https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html</a>.</p>
			<p>The first collection type you will learn about are arrays, which lets you store information in an ordered list.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Understanding arrays</h1>
			<p>Let's say<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> you want to store the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>List of items to buy at a convenience store</li>
				<li>Chores that you have to do every month</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Arrays would be suitable for this. An array stores values in an ordered list. Here's what it looks like:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.01_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1: Array&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1: Array</p>
			<p>Values must be of the same type. You can access any value in an array by using the array index, which starts with <code>0</code>.</p>
			<p>If you create an array using the <code>let</code> keyword, its contents can't be changed after it has been created. If you want to change an array's contents after creation, use the <code>var</code> keyword.</p>
			<p>Let's see how to work with arrays. You'll create an array by assigning a value to it in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Creating an array</h2>
			<p>In previous<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> chapters, you created a constant or variable by declaring it and assigning an initial value to it. You can create an array the same way.</p>
			<p>Imagine that your spouse has asked you to get some items from a convenience store. Let's implement a shopping list using an array. Add the following code to your playground and click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<pre>var shoppingList = ["Eggs", "Milk"]</pre>
			<p>This instruction creates an array variable named <code>shoppingList</code>. The assigned value, <code>["Eggs", "Milk"]</code>, is an array <code>String</code>, with <code>"Eggs"</code> at index <code>0</code>. </p>
			<p>Using the <code>var</code> keyword here means that the array's contents can be modified. As Swift uses type inference, this array's elements will be of type <code>String</code>. </p>
			<p>Imagine that you need to check how many items you need to get at the store. In the next section, you'll learn how to determine the number of elements in an array.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Checking the number of elements in an array</h2>
			<p>To find out <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>how many elements there are in an array, use <code>count</code>. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>shoppingList.count</pre>
			<p>As the <code>shoppingList</code> array contains two elements, <code>2</code> is displayed in the Results area.</p>
			<p>You can check to see if an array is empty by using <code>isEmpty</code>. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>shoppingList.isEmpty</pre>
			<p>As the <code>shoppingList</code> array contains two elements, <code>false</code> is displayed in the Results area.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">It is also possible to see if an array is empty by using <code>shoppingList.count == 0</code>, but using <code>shoppingList.isEmpty</code> offers better performance.</p>
			<p>Imagine that your spouse called, and asked you if you can get chicken and cooking oil while you're at the store. In the next section, you'll see how to add elements to the end of an array, and <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>at a specified array index.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Adding a new element to an array</h2>
			<p>You can add a <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>new element to the end of an array by using <code>append(_:)</code>. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>shoppingList.append("Cooking Oil")</pre>
			<p><code>"Cooking Oil"</code> has been added to the end of the <code>shoppingList</code> array, which now contains three elements â€“ "<code>Eggs"</code>, <code>"Milk"</code>, and <code>"Cooking Oil"</code>. This can be seen in the Results area.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">You can also add a new element to an array with the <code>+</code> operator, using the following code: <code>shoppingList = shoppingList + ["Cooking Oil"]</code>.</p>
			<p>You can add a new item at a specified index using <code>insert(_:at:)</code>. Type and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>shoppingList.insert("Chicken", at: 1)</pre>
			<p>This inserts <code>"Chicken"</code> at index <code>1</code>, so now the <code>shoppingList</code> array contains <code>"Eggs"</code>, <code>"Chicken"</code>, <code>"Milk"</code>, and <code>"Cooking Oil"</code>. Note that <code>"Chicken"</code> is the second element in the array as the first element is at index <code>0</code>. This can be seen in the Results area. </p>
			<p>Imagine that you've got the first item on your shopping list, and now you need to know what's the next item in the list. In the next section, you'll see how to access a specific array element using the array index.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Accessing an array element</h2>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> specify an array index to access a particular element. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>shoppingList[2]</pre>
			<p>This returns the array element stored at index <code>2</code>, and <code>"Milk"</code> is displayed in the Results area.</p>
			<p>Imagine that your spouse called and asked you to get soy milk instead of milk. As this array was declared using the <code>var</code> keyword, you can modify the values stored in it.  You'll learn how in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Assigning a new value to a particular index</h2>
			<p>You can replace<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> an existing array element by specifying the index and assigning a new value to it. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>shoppingList[2] = "Soy Milk"
shoppingList</pre>
			<p>This replaces the value stored at index <code>2</code>, <code>"Milk"</code>, with <code>"Soy Milk"</code>. The <code>shoppingList</code> array now contains <code>"Eggs"</code>, <code>"Chicken"</code>, <code>"Soy Milk"</code>, and <code>"Cooking Oil"</code>, as shown in the Results area.</p>
			<p>Note that the index used must be valid. For instance, you can't use index <code>4</code> as the only valid indexes here are <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>. Doing so would cause the program to crash.</p>
			<p>Imagine that your spouse called, and told you that there was chicken in the fridge, so you no longer have to get it. In the next section, you'll see two ways to remove elements from an array.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Removing an element from an array</h2>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> remove an element from an array by using <code>remove(at:)</code>. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>shoppingList.remove(at: 1)
shoppingList</pre>
			<p>This removes the item at index <code>1</code>, <code>"Chicken"</code>, from the <code>shoppingList</code> array, so now it contains <code>"Eggs"</code>, <code>"Soy Milk"</code>, and <code>"Cooking Oil"</code>. You can see this in the Results area.</p>
			<p>If you're removing the last item from the array, you can use <code>removeLast()</code> instead.</p>
			<p>Imagine that you've gotten every item in the list, and you would like to go through your list again to make sure. You'll need to access every array element in turn and perform operations<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/> on each element. You'll see how to do this in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Iterating over an array</h2>
			<p>Remember the <code>for-in</code> loop you studied in the previous chapter? You can use it to iterate over<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/> every element in an array. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>for shoppingListItem in shoppingList {
Â Â Â print(shoppingListItem)
}</pre>
			<p>This prints out every element in the array to the Debug area.</p>
			<p>You can also <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>use <code>1...</code>. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>for shoppingListItem in shoppingList[1...] {
Â Â Â print(shoppingListItem)
}</pre>
			<p>This prints out the elements of the array starting from the element at index <code>1</code> to the Debug area.</p>
			<p>You now know how to use an array to create an ordered list, such as a shopping list, and how to perform array operations. In the next section, let's look at how to store an unordered list of key-value pairs using a dictionary.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Understanding dictionaries</h1>
			<p>Let's say you're <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>writing an <em class="italic">Address Book </em>app. You would need to store a list of names and their corresponding contact numbers. A dictionary would be perfect for this.</p>
			<p>A dictionary <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>stores <strong class="bold">key-value pairs</strong> in an unordered list. Here's what it looks like:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.02_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2: Dictionary&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2: Dictionary</p>
			<p>All keys must be of the same type and must be unique. All values must be of the same type, but are not necessarily unique. Keys and values don't have to be of the same type as each other. You use the key to get the corresponding value.</p>
			<p>If you create a dictionary using the <code>let</code> keyword, its contents can't be changed after it has been created. If you want to change the contents after creation, use the <code>var</code> keyword.</p>
			<p>Let's look at how to work with dictionaries. You'll create a dictionary by assigning a value to it in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Creating a dictionary</h2>
			<p>Imagine that<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/> you're creating an <em class="italic">Address Book</em> app. For this app, you'll use a dictionary to store your contacts. Just like an array, you can create a new dictionary by declaring it and assigning an initial value to it. Add the following code to your playground and click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<pre>var contactList = ["Shah": "+60123456789", "Aamir": "+0223456789"]</pre>
			<p>This instruction creates a dictionary variable named <code>contactList</code>. The assigned value, <code>["Shah": "+60123456789", "Aamir": "+0223456789" ]</code>, is a dictionary literal. It represents a dictionary with two elements. Each element is a key-value pair, with the contact name as the key and the contact number as the value. Note that since the contact name is the key field, it should be unique.</p>
			<p>Since the <code>contactList</code> dictionary is a variable, you can change the contents of the dictionary after it has been created. Both key and value are of type <code>String</code> due to type inference.</p>
			<p>Imagine that your app has to display the total number of contacts. In the next section, you'll learn how<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> to determine the number of elements in a dictionary.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Checking the number of elements in a dictionary</h2>
			<p>To find out <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>how many elements there are in a dictionary, use <code>count</code>. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>contactList.count</pre>
			<p>As there are two elements in the <code>contactList</code> dictionary, <code>2</code> is displayed in the Results area.</p>
			<p>You can check whether a dictionary is empty by using <code>isEmpty</code>. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>contactList.isEmpty</pre>
			<p>Since the <code>contactList</code> dictionary has two elements, <code>false</code> is displayed in the Results area.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">It is also possible to see if a dictionary is empty by using <code>contactlist.count == 0</code>, but using <code>contactList.isEmpty</code> offers better performance.</p>
			<p>Imagine that you just finished a meeting, and want to add a new contact to your app. As this dictionary was declared using the <code>var</code> keyword, you can add key-value pairs to it. You'll learn how in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Adding a new element to a dictionary</h2>
			<p>To add a new <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>element to a dictionary, provide a key and assign a value to it. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>contactList["Jane"] = "+0229876543"
contactList</pre>
			<p>This adds a new key-value pair with the key <code>"Jane"</code> and the value <code>"+0229876543"</code> to the <code>contactList</code> dictionary. It now consists of <code>"Shah": "+60126789345"</code>, <code>"Aamir": "+0223456789"</code>, and <code>"Jane": "+0229876543"</code>. You can see this in the Results area.</p>
			<p>Imagine that you want to call one of your contacts, and you want the phone number for that contact. In the next section, you'll see how to access dictionary elements by specifying the key for the desired value.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Accessing a dictionary element</h2>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> specify a dictionary key to access its corresponding value. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>contactList["Shah"]</pre>
			<p>This returns the value for the key <code>"Shah"</code>, and <code>+60123456789</code> is displayed in the Results area. </p>
			<p>Imagine that one of your contacts has a new phone, so you have to update the phone number for that contact. You can modify the key-value pairs stored in a dictionary.  You'll learn how in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Assigning a new value to an existing key</h2>
			<p>You can assign a new<a id="_idIndexMarker167"/> value to an existing key. Type and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>contactList["Shah"] = "+60126789345"
contactList</pre>
			<p>This assigns a new value to the key <code>"Shah"</code>. The <code>contactList</code> dictionary now contains <code>"Shah": "+60126789345"</code>, <code>"Aamir": "+0223456789"</code>, and <code>"Jane": "+0229876543"</code>. You can see this in the Results area.</p>
			<p>Imagine that you have to remove a contact from your app. Let's see how you can remove <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>elements from a dictionary in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Removing an element from a dictionary</h2>
			<p>To remove <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>an element from a dictionary, assign <code>nil</code> to an existing key. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>contactList["Jane"] = nil
contactList</pre>
			<p>This removes the element with the key <code>"Jane"</code> from the <code>contactList</code> dictionary, and it now contains <code>"Shah": "+60126789345"</code> and <code>"Aamir": "+0223456789"</code>. You can see this in the Results area.</p>
			<p>If you want to retain the value you are removing, use <code>removeValue(for:Key)</code> instead. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>var oldDictValue = contactList.removeValue(forKey: "Aamir")
oldDictValue 
contactList</pre>
			<p>This removes the element with the key <code>"Aamir"</code> from the <code>contactList</code> dictionary and assigns its value to <code>oldDictValue</code>. Now <code>oldDictValue</code> now contains <code>"+0223456789"</code> and the <code>contactList</code> dictionary contains <code>"Shah": "+60126789345"</code>. You can see this in the Results area.</p>
			<p>Imagine that you would like to call each contact to wish them a happy new year. You'll have to access every dictionary element in turn and perform operations on each element. You'll see how to do this in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Iterating over a dictionary</h2>
			<p>Just like <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>arrays, you can use a <code>for-in</code> loop to iterate over every element in a dictionary. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>for (name, contactNumber) in contactList {
Â Â Â print("\(name) : \(contactNumber)")
}</pre>
			<p>This prints every element in the dictionary to the Debug area. Since dictionaries are unordered, you may get the results in a different order when you run this code again.</p>
			<p>You know now how to use a dictionary to create an unordered list of key-value pairs, such as a contact list, and how to perform dictionary operations. In the next section, let's see how to store an unordered list of values in a set.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Understanding sets</h1>
			<p>Let's say you're<a id="_idIndexMarker171"/> writing a <em class="italic">Movies</em> app and you want to store a list of movie genres. You could do this with a set.</p>
			<p>A set stores values in an unordered list. Here's what it looks like:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.03_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3: Set&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3: Set</p>
			<p>All values are of the same type.</p>
			<p>If you create a set using the <code>let</code> keyword, its contents can't be changed after it has been created. If you want to change the contents after creation, use the <code>var</code> keyword.</p>
			<p>Let's look at how <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>to work with sets. You'll create a set by assigning a value to it in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Creating a set</h2>
			<p>Imagine that <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>you are creating a <em class="italic">Movies</em> app and you would like to store movie genres in your app. As you have seen for arrays and dictionaries, you can create a set by declaring it and assigning a new value to it. Add the following code to your playground and click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<pre>var movieGenres: Set = ["Horror", "Action", "Romantic Comedy"]</pre>
			<p>This instruction creates a set variable named <code>movieGenres</code>. Note that the set literal assigned to it, <code>["Horror", "Action", "Romantic Comedy"]</code> has the same format as an array literal, so you use type annotation to set the type of <code>movieGenres</code> to <code>Set</code>. Otherwise, Swift's type inference will create an array variable and not a set variable. </p>
			<p>Using the <code>var</code> keyword here means that the set's contents can be modified. This set's elements will be of type <code>String</code> due to type inference.</p>
			<p>Imagine that you need to show the total number of genres in your app. Let's see how to find the number of elements there are in a set in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Checking the number of elements in a set</h2>
			<p>To find out<a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> how many elements there are in a set, use <code>count</code>. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>movieGenres.count</pre>
			<p>Since the <code>movieGenres</code> set contains three elements, <code>3</code> is displayed in the Results area.</p>
			<p>You can check whether a set is empty by using <code>isEmpty</code>. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>movieGenres.isEmpty</pre>
			<p>As <code>movieGenres</code> contains three elements, <code>false</code> is displayed in the Results area.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">It is also possible to see if a set is empty by using <code>movieGenres.count == 0</code>, but using <code>movieGenres.isEmpty</code> offers better performance.</p>
			<p>Imagine that users of your app can add more genres to it. As this set was declared using the <code>var</code> keyword, you <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>can add elements to it. You'll learn how in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Adding a new element to a set</h2>
			<p>You can add <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>a new element to a set by using <code>insert(_:)</code>. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>movieGenres.insert("War") 
movieGenres</pre>
			<p>This adds a new item, <code>"War"</code>, to the <code>movieGenres</code> set, which now contains <code>"Horror"</code>, <code>"Romantic Comedy"</code>, <code>"War"</code>, and <code>"Action"</code>. This is displayed in the Results area.</p>
			<p>Imagine that a user would like to know if a certain genre is available in your app. In the next section, you'll learn how to check if an element is in a set.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Checking whether a set contains an element</h2>
			<p>To check whether<a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> a set contains an element, use <code>contains(_:)</code>. Type in and run the following code: </p>
			<pre>movieGenres.contains("War")</pre>
			<p>As <code>"War"</code> is one of the elements inside the <code>movieGenres</code> set, <code>true</code> is displayed in the Results area.</p>
			<p>Imagine that a user wants to remove a genre from his list of genres. Let's see how to remove items from a set that are no longer needed in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Removing an item from a set</h2>
			<p>To remove <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>an item from a set, use <code>remove(_:)</code>. The value you are removing can be assigned to a variable or a constant. If the value doesn't exist in the set, <code>nil</code> will be returned. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>var oldSetValue = movieGenres.remove("Action")
oldSetValue 
movieGenres</pre>
			<p><code>"Action"</code> is removed from the <code>movieGenres</code> set and assigned to <code>oldSetValue</code>, and the <code>movieGenres</code> set now contains <code>"Horror"</code>, <code>"Romantic Comedy"</code>, and <code>"War"</code>. You'll see this displayed in the Results area.</p>
			<p>To remove all of the elements from a set, use <code>removeAll()</code>. </p>
			<p>Imagine that you would like to display all the genres your app has as recommendations for your app's users. You can iterate over and perform operations on each set element. Let's see how to do so in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Iterating over a set</h2>
			<p>As with arrays<a id="_idIndexMarker179"/> and dictionaries, you can use a <code>for-in</code> loop to iterate over every element in a set. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>for genre in movieGenres {
Â Â Â print(genre)
}</pre>
			<p>You should see each set element in the Debug area. Since sets are unsorted, you may get the results in a different order when you run this code again.</p>
			<p>Imagine that you want your app to perform operations on the genres you like with the genres that another person likes. In the next section, you will learn about the various operations that you can do with sets in Swift.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Exploring Set operations</h2>
			<p>It's easy <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>to <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>perform <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>set<a id="_idIndexMarker183"/> operations such as <strong class="bold">union</strong>, <strong class="bold">intersection</strong>, <strong class="bold">subtracting</strong>, and <strong class="bold">symmetric difference</strong>. Type <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>let movieGenres2: Set = ["Science Fiction", "War", "Fantasy"]
movieGenres.union(movieGenres2)
movieGenres.intersection(movieGenres2)
movieGenres.subtracting(movieGenres2)
movieGenres.symmetricDifference(movieGenres2)</pre>
			<p>Here, you are performing set operations on two sets, <code>movieGenres</code> and <code>movieGenres2</code>. Let's see the results of each set operation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>union(_:)</code> returns a new set containing all of the values in both sets, so <code>{"Horror", "Romantic Comedy", "War", "Science Fiction", "Fantasy"}</code> will be displayed in the Results area.</li>
				<li><code>intersection(_:)</code> returns a new set containing only the values common to both sets, so <code>{"War"}</code> will be displayed in the Results area.</li>
				<li><code>subtracting(_:)</code> returns a new set without the values in the specified set, so <code>{"Horror", "Romantic Comedy"}</code> will be displayed in the Results area.</li>
				<li><code>symmetricDifference(_:)</code> returns a new set without the values common to both sets, so <code>{"Horror", "Romantic Comedy", "Science Fiction", "Fantasy"}</code> will be displayed in the Results area.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Imagine that you want your app to compare the genres you like with the genres that another person likes. In the next section, you'll learn how to check if a set is equal to another set, is part of another set, or has nothing in common with another set.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Exploring set membership and equality</h2>
			<p>It's easy to<a id="_idIndexMarker185"/> check if a set is equal to, a <strong class="bold">subset</strong>, a <strong class="bold">superset</strong>, or a <strong class="bold">disjoint</strong> of another set. Type in and run the following code:</p>
			<pre>let movieGenresSubset: Set = ["Horror", "Romantic Comedy"]
let movieGenresSuperset: Set = ["Horror", "Romantic Comedy", "War", "Science Fiction", "Fantasy"]

			<p>Let's see how this code works:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <code>isEqual</code> operator (<code>==</code>) checks whether all the members of one set are the same as those of another set. Since not all the members of the <code>movieGenres</code> set are the same as those in the <code>movieGenres2</code> set, <code>false</code> will be displayed in the Results area.</li>
				<li><code>isSubset(of:)</code> checks whether a set is a subset of another set. Since all the members of the <code>movieGenresSubset</code> set is in the <code>movieGenres</code> set, <code>true</code> will be displayed in the Results area.</li>
				<li><code>isSuperset(of:)</code> checks whether a set is a superset of another set. Since all the members of the <code>movieGenres</code> set are in the <code>movieGenresSuperset</code> set, <code>true</code> will be displayed in the Results area.</li>
				<li><code>isDisjoint(with:)</code> checks whether a set has no values in common with another set. Since the <code>movieGenresDisjoint</code> set has no members in common with the <code>movieGenres</code> set, <code>true</code> will be displayed in the Results area.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You know now how to use a set to create an unordered list of values, such as a list of movie genres, and how to perform set operations. This concludes the chapter on collection <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>types. Well done!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you looked at collection types in Swift. First you learned about arrays. This allows you to use an ordered list of values to represent an item like a shopping list, and perform operations on it.</p>
			<p>Next, you learned about dictionaries. This allows you to use an unordered list of key-value pairs to represent an item like a contact list, and perform operations on it.</p>
			<p>Finally, you learned about sets. This allows you to use an unordered list of values to represent an item like a movie genre list, and perform operations on it.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will study how to group a set of instructions together using functions. This is handy when you want to execute a set of instructions multiple times in your program.</p>
