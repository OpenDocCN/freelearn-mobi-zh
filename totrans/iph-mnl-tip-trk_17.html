			<h1 id="_idParaDest-286"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor597"/>Chapter 17</em>: Getting Time, Weather, and Stock Information</h1>
			<p>One reason why the iPhone has proven so popular is that it can be almost anything you want it to be. Besides letting you make phone calls and send text messages, an iPhone can also be a timepiece and a source for news. Two common types of news that people often want are weather forecasts and stock quote information.</p>
			<p>An iPhone comes with the Clock app for not only helping you keep track of time in other parts of the world, but also to serve as a timer and stopwatch so that you can keep track of minutes or seconds to time yourself for exercising, cooking, or any other activity that involves keeping track of time.</p>
			<p>The Weather app lets you get the forecast not just for your own area but for any city around the world. This way, you can know the temperatures and climate in another part of the world that you may be traveling to soon so that you can dress appropriately.</p>
			<p>Finally, the iPhone includes the Stocks app to let you watch stock quotes. This way, you can keep track of your portfolio and follow your favorite stocks to see how they're doing during the day.</p>
			<p>The topics this chapter covers are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using the Clock app</li>
				<li>Getting weather forecasts</li>
				<li>Viewing stock quotes</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-287"><a id="_idTextAnchor598"/><a id="_idTextAnchor599"/><a id="_idTextAnchor600"/><a id="_idTextAnchor601"/>Using the Clock app</h1>
			<p>The Clock app can show<a id="_idIndexMarker981"/> you the current time. When you open the Home screen on your iPhone, you can view the current time either at the top of the screen (which displays the time in digital format, such as 8:43 AM) or in the Clock app itself (which displays time in analog format, showing an hour and minute hand on a clock face).</p>
			<p>The Clock app can do more than just<a id="_idIndexMarker982"/> display the current time. Its five features include the<a id="_idIndexMarker983"/> following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">World Clock</strong>: Tracks time in different time zones</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Alarm</strong>: Sets one or more alarms so that your iPhone can alert you at a specific time</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Bedtime</strong>: Defines a time to sleep and wake up</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stopwatch</strong>: Tracks the amount of time that has elapsed </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Timer</strong>: Defines a time interval to count down from, such as 5 minutes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You may not need all of these features, but chances are good that you'll likely want to use one or more of these features when carrying your iPhone one day.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-288"><a id="_idTextAnchor602"/>Using the world clock</h2>
			<p>If you need to make phone calls to <a id="_idIndexMarker984"/>people who live in different time zones, you probably don't want to call when someone's likely to be asleep. Likewise, you probably don't want to schedule a phone call when you might be asleep.</p>
			<p>To help you keep track of time zones around the world, use the <strong class="bold">World Clock</strong> feature to track time in common regions around the world, such as Berlin, Tokyo, or New York. By seeing the current time in another time zone, you'll know the time of the day in another part of the world.</p>
			<p>To add a time <a id="_idIndexMarker985"/>zone to the <strong class="bold">World Clock</strong> feature, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Clock</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">World Clock</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. A <strong class="bold">Choose a City</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.1</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer458"><img alt="Figure 17.1 – Choosing a city to add to the world clock&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.1 – Choosing a city to add to the world clock</p></li>
				<li>Scroll through this list and tap a letter on the right side of the screen (such as <strong class="bold">T</strong> to jump to cities <a id="_idIndexMarker986"/>starting with T, such as Trinidad), or tap<a id="_idIndexMarker987"/> in the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> field at the top of the screen and type a part or all of the city name you want to use. A list of matching cities appears as you type, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.2</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer459"><img alt="Figure 17.2 – Searching for a city&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.2 – Searching for a city</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the<a id="_idIndexMarker988"/> city name.</li>
				<li>Repeat <em class="italic">Steps 3–5</em> for each additional<a id="_idIndexMarker989"/> city you want to add to the world clock to create a list of different cities and their current times, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.3</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer460">
					<img alt="Figure 17.3 – A list of cities in different time zones&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.03_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.3 – A list of cities in different time zones</p>
			<p>The Clock app <a id="_idIndexMarker990"/>organizes cities in the order you add them. If you want to<a id="_idIndexMarker991"/> rearrange the cities in the world clock list or remove a city from the list, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Clock</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">World Clock</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-left corner of the screen. Notice that a three horizontal-line icon appears at the far right of each city, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.4</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer461"><img alt="Figure 17.4 – The three horizontal-line icon lets you drag city names up or down&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.4 – The three horizontal-line icon lets you drag city names up or down</p></li>
				<li>Slide the <a id="_idIndexMarker992"/>horizontal icon of the city you want to move up or down to<a id="_idIndexMarker993"/> rearrange your list.</li>
				<li>Tap the white <strong class="bold">–</strong> symbol inside the red circle on the left of a city you want to remove, or swipe left. A red <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.5</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer462"><img alt="Figure 17.5 – Removing a city from the world clock list&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.5 – Removing a city from the world clock list</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> to remove<a id="_idIndexMarker994"/> a city from the list. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Of course, not everyone<a id="_idIndexMarker995"/> needs to know the time zone in another part of the world. For many people, it's far more important to wake up on time or set an alarm to remind them of an upcoming appointment.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-289"><a id="_idTextAnchor603"/>Setting alarms</h2>
			<p>Alarms can be handy to<a id="_idIndexMarker996"/> wake up on time (such as catching a flight) or simply to remind <a id="_idIndexMarker997"/>you of an upcoming appointment. You can set as many alarms as you wish, but the basic idea is to define a time for the alarm to go off. </p>
			<p>Once an alarm goes off, you can save that alarm to use in the future, or simply delete the alarm.</p>
			<p>To set an alarm, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Clock</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Alarm</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. The <strong class="bold">Alarm</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. An <strong class="bold">Add Alarm</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.6</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer463"><img alt=" Figure 17.6 – The Add Alarm screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"> Figure 17.6 – The Add Alarm screen</p></li>
				<li>Choose <a id="_idIndexMarker998"/>a time. You can either scroll up or down on the currently <a id="_idIndexMarker999"/>displayed time or type a time using the numerical keypad.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap <strong class="bold">Repeat</strong> and choose a day you want the alarm to repeat, such as <strong class="bold">Every Monday</strong> or <strong class="bold">Every Thursday</strong>.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap <strong class="bold">Label</strong> and type a descriptive name for your alarm.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap <strong class="bold">Sound</strong> and choose a sound for your alarm.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the <strong class="bold">Snooze</strong> switch if you want to allow the snooze feature to temporarily shut off the alarm.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Save</strong> in the <a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/>upper-right corner of the screen. Your alarm now appears <a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/>on the <strong class="bold">Alarm</strong> screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.7</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer464"><img alt="Figure 17.7 – An alarm set and ready to go&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.07_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.7 – An alarm set and ready to go</p></li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the switch to the right of your alarm to toggle it off or on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you set an alarm, you may want to modify it, such as changing its time or its label. To edit an existing alarm, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Clock</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Alarm</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. The <strong class="bold">Alarm</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-left corner of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the alarm you want to modify. An <strong class="bold">Edit Alarm</strong> screen appears that looks nearly identical to the <strong class="bold">Add Alarm</strong> screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 17.6</em>).</li>
				<li>Make any changes and tap <strong class="bold">Save</strong>. To delete an alarm, swipe left on that alarm and then tap the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Alarms can be handy for making sure you wake up on time, but if you regularly need an alarm, you should use the <strong class="bold">Bedtime</strong> settings instead. Next, let's look at the stopwatch settings.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-290"><a id="_idTextAnchor604"/>Using a stopwatch</h2>
			<p>A stopwatch is commonly <a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/>used in time events such as a race. To use the stopwatch, follow these <a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/>steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Clock</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Stopwatch</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. The stopwatch screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.8</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer465"><img alt="Figure 17.8 – The stopwatch screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.08_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.8 – The stopwatch screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> button to<a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/> start tracking the time. When the stopwatch starts<a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/> tracking the time, the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> button turns into a <strong class="bold">Stop</strong> button.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the <strong class="bold">Lap</strong> button each time you want to record a separate time, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.9</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer466"><img alt="Figure 17.9 – Timing multiple laps&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.9 – Timing multiple laps</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Reset</strong> to clear the times and st<a id="_idTextAnchor605"/><a id="_idTextAnchor606"/>art at 0 again.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A stopwatch lets you<a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/> track time, but sometimes you may want to count down from a certain<a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/> time interval so that way you know when to take something out of the oven or when to stop exercising after a fixed time interval.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-291"><a id="_idTextAnchor607"/>Setting a timer</h2>
			<p>When cooking, you may need to<a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/> put something in the oven for 30 minutes or <a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/>mix something for 10 minutes. That's when you need to set a timer and define a time interval to count down.</p>
			<p>To set a timer, follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Clock</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Timer</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. The timer screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.10</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer467"><img alt="Figure 17.10 – The timer screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.10_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.10 – The timer screen</p></li>
				<li>Set a time<a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/> interval to start counting down from, such as 3 minutes or 1 hour <a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/>and 13 minutes.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap <strong class="bold">When Timer Ends</strong> and select a sound to use for when the timer reaches zero.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Time is important, but when you're going outside, you may also want to know about the weather conditions so that you'll know to dress accordingly. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-292"><a id="_idTextAnchor608"/>Getting weather forecasts</h1>
			<p>Knowing how to dress <a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/>and what to wear can be important in your own city, along with any cities you may plan on visiting in the immediate future. By examining the weather forecast, you can plan for events, travel, and the clothing you'll need.</p>
			<p>To use the weather forecast app, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Weather</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the three horizontal-line icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen. A list of different cities and their current temperatures appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.11</em>: <div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer468"><img alt="Figure 17.11 – The search icon&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.11_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.11 – The search icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <a id="_idIndexMarker1013"/>search icon. A <strong class="bold">Search</strong> text field appears at the top of the screen.</li>
				<li>Type a part of or the entire city name. A list of the matching city names appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.12</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer469"><img alt="Figure 17.12 – Searching for city names&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.12 – Searching for city names</p></li>
				<li>Tap a city name. That city's weather<a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/> forecast appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Add</strong> in the upper-right corner to add this city to your list of weather forecasts, and the result is as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.13</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer470"><img alt="Figure 17.13 – A list of cities&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.13_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.13 – A list of cities</p></li>
				<li>Tap the o<strong class="bold">C</strong> or o<strong class="bold">F</strong> icon to view<a id="_idIndexMarker1015"/> temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit.</li>
				<li>Tap a city to view more detailed weather forecasts, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.14</em>: <div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer471"><img alt="Figure 17.14 – A weather forecast for the next few days&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.14 – A weather forecast for the next few days</p></li>
				<li>Scroll down to see more weather information, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.15</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer472"><img alt="Figure 17.15 – Scrolling down displays additional weather information&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.15 – Scrolling down displays additional weather information</p></li>
				<li>Swipe left or right to<a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/> view forecasts for other cities on your list.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've defined a city to display weather forecasts, you can always remove a city if you no longer want to see forecasts for that city. To remove a city from the weather forecast list, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Weather</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>If a single city's weather<a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/> forecast appears, tap the list icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.16</em>. A list of cities appears:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer473"><img alt=" Figure 17.16 – The list icon&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.16_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"> Figure 17.16 – The list icon</p></li>
				<li>Swipe left on a city name you want to remove. A <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button appears on the right.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button to remove your chosen city from the list of weather forecasts.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Combined with the Clock app, which lets you see the current time in other parts of the world, the Weather app lets you view the weather conditions in those same areas of the world. </p>
			<p>Although everyone needs to know the time and weather, not everyone may need to know about the stock market. But even if you don't have any money invested in specific stocks, you may find it interesting to track stocks and business news at the same time.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-293"><a id="_idTextAnchor609"/>Viewing stock quotes</h1>
			<p>The Stocks app lets you view stock quotes and <a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/>business news. To use the Stocks app, you'll need to add companies you want to follow and remove them when you no longer want to follow them.</p>
			<p>To view stock quotes, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Stocks</strong> app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap in the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> text field at the top of the screen.</li>
				<li>Type a part of or the entire company's stock quote symbol, such as AAPL for Apple. A list of possible stock quote matches appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.17</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer474"><img alt="Figure 17.17 – Searching for a specific stock quote&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.17 – Searching for a specific stock quote</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the stock quote you<a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/> want. The latest financial news for that company appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.18</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer475"><img alt="Figure 17.18 – Financial news about a particular company&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure17.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 17.18 – Financial news about a particular company</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Add to Watchlist</strong> to save this<a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/> company's stock quote in the Stocks app.</li>
				<li>Tap the close (<strong class="bold">x</strong>) icon in the upper-right corner of the financial news to make it go away. At any time, you can tap on a stock quote to see more detailed information.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've created a watchlist of stocks, you can always remove a company from your watchlist at any time by swiping left on that stock quote and tappi<a id="_idTextAnchor610"/>ng the <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> button. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-294"><a id="_idTextAnchor611"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>The Clock app can be useful for setting alarms to wake up or go to bed, or to alert you of an upcoming appointment or meeting. You can also use the Clock app to turn your iPhone into a stopwatch or a timer. </p>
			<p>The Weather app can be handy to give you forecasts for the next few days in your own city or a city you're planning to visit soon. Besides viewing a forecast, you can also view the current weather conditions in different parts of the world.</p>
			<p>The Stocks app can help you keep track of your stock portfolio so that you can see how much money you've made or lost.</p>
			<p>Since tracking money can be handy, you might also want to learn how to make contactless payments through Apple Pay, which is the topic of the next chapter.   </p>
