    necessary to write iOS applications. From simple Swift commands on the command
    line using the open source version of Swift, to interactively testing graphical
    content on OS X with the Xcode Playground editor, Swift language and syntax is
    introduced by examples.'

    comes bundled with Xcode. It is not necessary to have an iOS device to write or
    test the code. If you want to run the code on your own iOS device, then you will
    need an Apple ID to sign in, but the application will be limited to directly connected
    devices. Similarly, the watch application can be tested in a local simulator or
    on a local device.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is aimed at developers who are interested in learning the Swift programming
    language, either using the open source version of Swift on Linux or the version
    bundled with Xcode on OS X. However, after [Chapter 1](part0016_split_000.html#F8901-d7e55eb5242648e89c396442afe4f84b
    "Chapter 1. Exploring Swift"), *Exploring Swift*, the remainder of the chapters
    use Xcode features or have iOS examples which can only be used on OS X with Xcode.
    These chapters show how to write iOS applications on OS X using Swift. No prior
    programming experience for iOS is assumed, though a basic level of programming
    experience in a dynamically or statically typed programming language is expected.
    The reader will be familiar with navigating and using Mac OS X and, in the cases
    where Terminal commands are required, the developer will have experience of simple
    shell commands or can pick it up quickly from the examples given.

    in the repository. Knowledge of Git is helpful if you are wanting to navigate
    between different versions; alternatively, the web-based interface at GitHub may
    be used instead. It is highly recommended that the reader becomes familiar with
    Git as it is the standard version control system for Xcode and the de facto standard
    for open source projects. The reader is invited to read the Git topics at the
    author's blog [http://alblue.bandlem.com/Tag/git/](http://alblue.bandlem.com/Tag/git/)
