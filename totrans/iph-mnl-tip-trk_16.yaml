- en: The Maps app can be useful, whether you're traveling in an unfamiliar area or
    even in your own neighborhood, because it can show you the fastest route to a
    specific destination. Even if car accidents or detours appear, the Maps app will
    give you the fastest route, along with alternate routes if you prefer taking a
    different road.

- en: Besides using the Maps app for directions, you can also use the Maps app to
    locate favorite spots or places and share those locations with others. If those
    people also have an iPhone, they can then get directions to that location by driving,
    walking, or taking mass transit.

    also want to know the weather conditions in the direction you're heading, or keep
