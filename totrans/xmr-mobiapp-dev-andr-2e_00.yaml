- en: Xamarin is built on top of Mono, an open source version of the .NET framework,
    based on the ECMA standards. Xamarin brings you a set of tools that includes its
    own C# compiler and a Common Language Runtime (CLR). The Mono framework source
    project is maintained by Xamarin, a San Francisco-based company (formerly by Novell
    and originally by Ximian). The prime intention of the Mono project was to make
    the .NET platform compatible with other non-Windows platforms such as Linux.

- en: After Attachmate acquired Novell in April 2011, the future of the Mono platform
    was pushed into dark. A few months later, Miguel de Icaza, a former Novell employee,
    founded a company called Xamarin and declared to continue using the Mono platform
    for commercial software development. Since then, Xamarin has sponsored the Mono
    open source platform development and provided the commercial .NET stacks for both
    the iOS and Android platforms. The .NET for iOS is called MonoTouch, or Xamarin.iOS,
    and .NET for Android is called Mono for Android, or Xamarin.Android.

- en: Xamarin frameworks enable developers to write cross-platform mobile applications
    targeting different platforms, including iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. Using
    Xamarin, you can develop a pure naive Android or iOS application using the C#
    programming language and share the application logic between the different platforms.
    This results in a faster development cycle and developers can leverage the existing
    C# and .NET programming skills, which helps reduce the learning curve to develop
    the mobile application.

    to build Xamarin.Android applications from the ground up. It explains the widely
    used basic and advanced Android concepts, including a user interface, data storage,
    consuming web services, geolocation, map, camera, and the build distribution process.

- en: This book provides the most comprehensive explanations of the basic and advanced
    Xamarin.Android concepts; you can precisely build with practical live examples
    to develop a complete working application. Over the course of this book, you will
    build a single application, the `POIApp`. With this application, we will cover
    all the fundamentals of Xamarin.Android to help you get stated with your own application
    development.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All the examples in this book can be completed using a 30-day trial version
    of Xamarin.Android. The examples were developed using Mac OS X (Yosemite), Xamarin
    Studio 5.9.3, and Xamarin.Android 5.1.3 (trial edition). Any later versions should
    work fine as long as they are valid Xamarin configurations. You can check the
    Xamarin website for specifics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Xamarin.Android can also be used in other configurations, including Windows
    OS. In Windows OS, you can either use Xamarin Studio or the Visual Studio Xamarin
    plugin as an IDE of your choice. Using a different configuration from what was
    used while developing the examples of this book may result in slight variations
    in the screens or steps described in the book.

- en: The examples provided in this book consume the REST web service developed in
    Java JAX-RS. You can deploy the web service code on your system to perform end-to-end
    testing, or alternatively, you can use the Apiary mock feed URLs provided in the
    code bundle. To deploy the web service code, you need MySQL and the Apache Tomcat™
    application server.
