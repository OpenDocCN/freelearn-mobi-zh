- en: Not so long ago, creating a mobile application and getting it published was
    difficult, costly, and, for most developers, commercially unviable. Flash forward
    a number of years to the introduction of the iPhone and App Store, and suddenly
    there was a way where anyone who could write a code in Apple's Objective-C language,
    and had a healthy understanding of provisioning certificates for the Mac, could
    write a smartphone application and distribute it worldwide with minimal amount
    of fuss and very little red tape. During the last decade, many of us in the web
    development community have moved away from archaic C-based languages, and have
    squarely focused much of our programming knowledge on JavaScript, that ubiquitous
    little language that despite all its shortcomings has gained momentum and was
    commonplace both on and off the Web.

- en: Shortly after that, we began to see a number of "alternative" platforms emerge
    which promised developers the ability to build mobile applications without the
    hassle of re-skilling in Objective-C, or in the case of Android, in Java. Among
    these was a newcomer called Titanium Mobile, which held the promise of allowing
    native applications to be built using only JavaScript, and the ability to make
    those applications cross-platform (across both iOS and Android). As of December
    2011, Appcelerator's Titanium Mobile boasts over 1.5 million active developers
    and has released 30,000 applications in the marketplace. It has the backing of
    major players such as eBay and powers some of the world's most popular apps, including
    Wunderlist, eBay Mobile, and GetGlue. There is support for Blackberry and the
    mobile web. It also has the ability to build cross-platform games using popular
    engines such as OpenGL and Box2D. It even has its own Mobile Marketplace, where
    developers can sell and distribute their Titanium modules to the rest of the community.

- en: In this book, we'll cover all of the aspects of building your mobile applications
    in Titanium Mobile, from layout to maps and GPS, all the way through social media
    integration and accessing your device's input hardware, including the camera and
    microphone. Each "recipe" described within is a self-contained lesson. You may
    pick and choose which areas you wish to read and use it as a reference. Alternatively,
    you can follow along each recipe in succession through most chapters and build
    a small app from start to finish. We'll also go through how to extend your applications
    using custom modules, and how to package them for distribution and sale in both
    the iTunes App Store and the Android Marketplace.

- en: In [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Building Apps using Native UI Components"),
    *Building Apps using Native UI Components*, we'll begin our journey into Titanium
    Mobile by understanding the basics of layout and creating controls, before moving
    onto tabbed interfaces, web views, and how to add and open multiple windows.

- en: In [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Working with Local and Remote Data Sources"),
    *Working with Local and Remote Data Sources*, we are going to build ourselves
    a mini-app that reads data from the Web using HTTP requests, and we'll see how
    to parse and iterate data in both XML and JSON formats. We'll also see how to
    store and retrieve data locally using an SQLite database and some basic SQL queries.

    Google Maps and GPS*, we'll add a MapView to your application and interact with
    it using annotations, geo-coding and events that track the user's location. We'll
    also go through the basics of adding routes and using your device's inbuilt compass
    to track our heading.

    *Getting to Grips with Events and Properties*, we'll briefly run through how properties
    work in Titanium, and how you can get and set global variables in your app. We'll
    also explain how event listeners and handlers work and how to fire events, both
    from your controls and custom events from anywhere in your application.

    Objective-C and Xcode. We'll run through a sample module from start to finish
    in Xcode for creating short URLs using the Bit.ly service.
