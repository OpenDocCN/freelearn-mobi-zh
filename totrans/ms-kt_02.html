			<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Creating Your First Android App</h1>
			<p>Android, a <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>mobile operating system developed by Google, runs on over two billion devices, such as smartphones, tablets, TVs, watches, and cars, and developers are able to write code that is compatible with these different devices.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’ll create our first <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>Android app. We will also familiarize ourselves with <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>Android Studio, the <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) that we’ll use to develop Android apps. We will also<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> learn some tips, shortcuts, and useful Android Studio features and understand the process of creating a project in Android Studio.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Android Studio overview</li>
				<li>Creating your Android app</li>
				<li>Android Studio tips and tricks</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow the instructions in this chapter, you will need to have Android Studio Hedgehog or later (<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/download">https://developer.android.com/studio/download</a>) downloaded.</p>
			<p>You can find the code for this chapter at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Kotlin-for-Android/tree/main/chaptertwo">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Kotlin-for-Android/tree/main/chaptertwo</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Android Studio overview</h1>
			<p>Developed by Google, Android Studio<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> is the official IDE for creating Android applications. Built upon JetBrains’ IntelliJ IDEA, it <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>provides a comprehensive platform for Android app development. It has all the features to enable you to develop Android apps with ease.</p>
			<p>Once you download <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>Android Studio from the official site, you need to download SDKs and set everything up for it to be ready for use. Open your newly installed Android Studio. You will see the following welcome screen:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19779_02_01.jpg" alt=" Figure 2.1 – Android Studio welcome screen" width="1064" height="949"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> Figure 2.1 – Android Studio welcome screen</p>
			<p>On the top right, we<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> have these quick options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">New Project</strong>: We use this to create new projects in Android Studio.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Open</strong>: We use this when we want to open existing projects using Android Studio.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Get from VCS</strong>: <strong class="bold">VCS</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">version control system</strong>. Examples of VCSs are GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. We<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> can always link our accounts and easily import projects that are hosted on VCS to our Android Studio.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">More options icon</strong>: This provides us with more options, such as <strong class="bold">Profile or Debug APK</strong>, <strong class="bold">Import Project</strong>, <strong class="bold">Import an Android Code Sample</strong>, <strong class="bold">SDK Manager</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Virtual Device Manager</strong>. We only use these options as needed, so we are<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> not going to dive deep into them at this point.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let us look at the navigation options on the left:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Projects</strong>: This is selected by default. It shows all the projects that you have created with Android Studio if present. If you do not have any, an empty screen will be displayed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customize</strong>: This provides a settings screen to customize the various aspects of Android Studio, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19779_02_02.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Customize Android Studio screen" width="1001" height="640"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – Customize Android Studio screen</p>
			<p class="list-inset">From the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>screenshot, we can see that we can quickly customize the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Color theme</strong>: We can set the theme to dark (<strong class="bold">Dracula</strong>), light (<strong class="bold">InteliJ Light</strong>), or high contrast depending on our preferences.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">IDE font</strong>: Here we set the preferred font size for our IDE.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Keymap</strong>: Here we configure what IntelliJ should use for mapping our keyboard and mouse shortcuts. It automatically picks the one for our operating system.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="list-inset">At the bottom of this screen, we can see two more settings options. One is <strong class="bold">Import Settings…</strong>, which we use when we want to import settings from either a previous Android Studio installation or a custom file. The other one is <strong class="bold">All settings…</strong>, which provides more customization options.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Plugins</strong>: Here, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>install external plugins to our Android Studio and also manage our installed plugins. There are several plugins in the Marketplace that we can install depending on the needs.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 – Plugins screen</p>
			<p>Now that we have an overview of several essential options on the Android Studio welcome screen, we will use the <strong class="bold">New Project</strong> option to create our first Android app in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Creating your Android app</h1>
			<p>Follow these steps to create<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> your first Android app:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>on the <strong class="bold">New Project</strong> button, which will take you to the <strong class="bold">Templates</strong> screen, as shown in the following figure:</li>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 – New Project | Templates screen</p>
			<p class="list-inset">The IDE presents us with a variety of options to choose from while creating new projects, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.4</em>. To start with, on the right-hand side, we need to choose the specific form factor that we are targeting. By default, <strong class="bold">Phone and Tablet</strong> is selected. We have other options, such as <strong class="bold">Wear OS</strong> if we want to target wearables, <strong class="bold">Android TV</strong> if we want to develop apps that run on Smart TVs powered by Android OS, and, lastly, <strong class="bold">Automotive</strong>, for apps that target Android Auto.</p>
			<p class="list-inset">We are going to use the default option since we want to target Android and tablet devices.</p>
			<p class="list-inset">Next, we have to choose a template from the options provided. There are several templates that we can use to quickly generate some functionality for our apps. For example, we have <strong class="bold">Bottom Navigation View Activity</strong> to generate a project with both UI and Koltin code for displaying bottom tabs.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">We will<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> choose <strong class="bold">Empty Activity</strong> as we want to start from scratch. We use this instead of the <strong class="bold">No Activity</strong> option since this comes with some dependencies set up for us.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Next</strong>, and we’ll see the screen to configure the project details, as follows:</li>

				<li value="4">As seen in the preceding screenshot, to finalize creating the project, we need to specify the following:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Name</strong>: This is the unique name for our project.</li><li><strong class="bold">Package name</strong>: This is a unique identifier for our project. Normally it’s a combination of the company website and app name.</li><li><strong class="bold">Save location</strong>: Here we specify the directory that our project will be in.</li><li><strong class="bold">Minimum SDK</strong>: This is the minimum Android version that our Android app will support. Android Studio gives us the percentage of devices using all the versions to help us decide the minimum Android version to support. For our project, we’ve chosen <strong class="bold">API 24:  Android 7.0 (Nougat)</strong>, which will run on approximately 94% of devices. It is important to note that choosing a lower minimum SDK version means we will have to make our app compatible across the different device versions, which can be a lot of work. Also, some features are only available in newer SDK versions, so we have to add a fallback mechanism for devices for</li></ul></li>
				<li>Lastly, tap <strong class="bold">Finish</strong>—this<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> creates our project. It will take a couple of minutes to prepare our project. Once done, we’ll be presented with the following screen:</li>

			<p>There are a<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> few things about the project structure we need to understand here. We will be diving deep into them in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Exploring the new project</h2>
			<p>In this subsection, we are going to look at the whole project structure so that we can understand the different components.</p>
			<p>On the left, we have<a id="_idIndexMarker054"/> the <strong class="bold">project structure</strong> with different directories and packages. On the right is the editor section, which by default does not have anything. When you open any file inside Android Studio, this is where they appear. This is the project structure for our new project:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19779_02_07.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – Project structure" width="819" height="1086"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7 – Project structure</p>
			<p>On the left, we have the <code>app</code> directory, which is the root directory, which has all files related to the project. From <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.7</em>, we can see that inside the <code>app</code> directory, we have the following different directories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>manifests</code>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>has a single <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file, which is essential for our app configuration. A manifest file has a <code>.xml</code> extension and contains the information critical to your app. It communicates this information to the Android system. In this file, we define the permissions needed for our app, the app name, and icons. We also declare activities and services in this file. Without declaring them, it’s hard for our app to use them.</li>
				<li>The <code>java</code> package: This package, although named <code>java</code>, has all the Kotlin files for our project. If we need to add any files, this is where we add them. We can also create packages that help us group files with related functionality together.  This directory is further subdivided into the following:<ul><li><code>com.packt.chaptertwo</code>: This is for the Kotlin files in our app</li><li><code>com.packt.chaptertwo (androidTest)</code>: Here, we add all the files for our instrumentation tests</li><li><code>com.packt.chaptertwo (test)</code>: Here, we add all the files for our unit tests</li></ul></li>
				<li>Resources: This directory, normally shortened to <code>res</code>, has all the resources needed for our app. These resources can include images, strings, and assets. From <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.6</em>, we can see that we have the following subdirectories:<ul><li><code>drawable</code>: This folder contains custom drawables, vector drawables, or PNGs and JPEGs that are used in the app.</li><li><code>mipmap</code>: This folder is where we place our launcher icons.</li><li><code>values</code>: This folder is where we place our color, string, style, and theme files. In this folder, we define global values to be used all throughout the app.</li><li><code>xml</code>: In this folder, we store XML files.</li></ul></li>
				<li><code>Gradle Scripts</code>: Here, we have all the Gradle scripts and Gradle property files needed for our project. In our new project, we have the following files:<ul><li><code>build.gradle (Project: chaptertwo)</code>: This is the top-level Gradle file where we add configurations that apply all over the project and submodules.</li><li><code>build.gradle (Module: app)</code>: This is the app module Gradle file. Inside here, we configure the app module. To understand this file, let’s look at the one<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> generated for our project:<pre class="source-code">

}</pre></li></ul><p class="list-inset">At the very <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>top, we specify the plugins needed by the module. In this case, we have the Android application and Kotlin plugins declared. After the <code>plugins</code> block, we have the <code>android</code> block. You can see we have the following properties defined inside this block:</p><ul><li><code>namespace</code>: This is used as the Kotlin or Java package name for the generated <code>R</code> and <code>BuildConfig</code> classes.</li><li><code>compileSDK</code>: This defines the Android SDK version that will be used by Gradle to compile our app.</li><li><code>defaultConfig</code>: This is a block where we specify the default config for all flavors and build types. Inside this block, we specify properties such as <code>applicationId</code>, <code>minSDK</code>, <code>targetSDK</code>, <code>versionCode</code>, <code>versionName</code>, and <code>testInstrumentationRunner</code>.</li><li><code>buildTypes</code>: This configures different build types for our application, such as <code>debug</code> and <code>release</code>, or any custom build that we define. Within each build type block, we specify properties such as <code>minifyEnabled</code>, <code>proguardFiles</code>, or <code>debuggable</code>.</li><li><code>compileOptions</code>: We use this block to configure properties related to Java compilation. For example, we have defined <code>sourceCompatibility</code> and <code>targetCompatibility</code>, which specify the Java version compatibility for our project source code.</li><li><code>kotlinOptions</code>: We use this block to configure options related to Kotlin. A commonly used option is <code>jvmTarget</code>, which specifies which Java version to use for Kotlin compilation.</li><li><code>buildFeatures</code>: We use this block to enable and disable specific features in our project. For example, we’ve enabled <code>compose</code> in our project. We can enable or disable other additional features, such as <code>viewBinding</code> and <code>dataBinding</code>.</li><li><code>ComposeOptions</code>: This block is specific to projects that use Jetpack Compose. For example, inside this block, we can set <code>kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion</code>.</li><li><code>packagingOptions</code>: We use this block to customize the packaging options of our project, particularly regarding conflicts and merging.</li><li><code>dependencies</code>: Here we specify the dependencies in our project. We can add different libraries, modules, or external dependencies in this block.</li></ul><ul><li><code>proguard-rules.pro</code>: This is a file where you define rules for ProGuard to use when<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> obfuscating your code. We will dive deep into this later in <a href="B19779_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor175"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>.</li><li><code>gradle.properties (Project Properties)</code>: Here we define properties that apply to the whole project. Some of the properties include setting the Kotlin style and also specifying the memory to be used.</li><li><code>gradle.properties (Global Properties)</code>: This is a global file. We specify settings that we want to apply to all our Android Studio projects.</li><li><code>gradle-wrapper.properties (Gradle Version)</code>: In this file, we specify the Gradle wrapper properties, including the version and the URL from where to download the Gradle wrapper.</li><li><code>local.properties (Local Properties)</code>: In this file, we specify settings that need to apply to our local setup. Normally, this file is never committed to version control, so it means the configurations we add here only apply to our individual setup.</li><li><code>settings.gradle (Project Setting)</code>: We use this file to apply some settings to our project. For example, if we need more modules in our project, this<a id="_idIndexMarker059"/> is where they’re specified.</li></ul></li>			</ul>
			<p>When we build the project, Android Studio compiles all the resources and code using the configurations specified in <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>our Gradle files and converts them into an <strong class="bold">Android Application Package</strong> (<strong class="bold">APK</strong>) or <strong class="bold">Android Application Bundle</strong> (<strong class="bold">AAB</strong>) that <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>can run on our Android phones or emulators.</p>
			<p>In this section, we have explored the newly created project and understood some of the key files and folders generated by Android Studio. In the next section, we are going to see how we can customize some things inside our Android Studio.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Android Studio tips and tricks</h1>
			<p>In this section, we’re going to <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>learn about some useful tips, shortcuts, and features in Android Studio.</p>
			<p>We’ll start by opening the <code>MainActivity.kt</code> file. When you open the file, you’ll be presented with the following layout:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19779_02_08.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – MainActivity file" width="575" height="629"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.8 – MainActivity file</p>
			<p>We can now see the<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> code inside the <code>MainActivity.kt</code> file, which is Kotlin source code. Above the tab with the filename, we can see a navigation bar, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19779_02_09.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Navigation bar" width="1086" height="91"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.9 – Navigation bar</p>
			<p>The navigation bar enables you to navigate easily and quickly between the different project files.</p>
			<p>We can also switch to<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> the <strong class="bold">project view</strong> to see all the resources in our project. The switch is at the very top of all the directories. By default, it is set to <strong class="bold">Android view</strong> and <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>has more options depending on your preference. Switching to project view gives us the following folder structure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19779_02_10.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10 – Project view" width="1025" height="617"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.10 – Project view</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.10</em>, we can see all the resources in our project, and we can easily navigate through the different files and folders.</p>
			<p>Android Studio <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>has a variety of different tool windows that provide a variety of options. Let us start with the <strong class="bold">Resource Manager</strong> tool window, which is at the top left part below the view switcher tab. Open that window and you will see the following:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19779_02_11.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 – Resource Manager tab" width="1087" height="454"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.11 – Resource Manager tab</p>
			<p>As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.11</em>, the <strong class="bold">Resource Manager</strong> tab shows all the resources in your project. We can also quickly add new vector and image assets and drawable files and import drawable here. The good thing is that we can also see a preview of these resources and easily browse the resources that we have in our project. Below this tab, we have the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> tab, to switch back to our project view, and below it, there is the <strong class="bold">Pull Requests</strong> tab, which enables us to see open pull requests from the project’s version control repository. This is especially useful when we are collaborating with other team members or colleagues.</p>
			<p>Android Studio allows <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>us to add or remove these tabs or choose which tabs to be shown on either the left, right, or bottom side. To remove a tab, you simply right-click on it and select the <strong class="bold">Remove from Sidebar</strong> option. Click on <strong class="bold">View</strong>, followed by <strong class="bold">Tool Windows</strong>. This action will display all the tool windows currently available for use.</p>
			<p>Android Studio provides alternative viewing options in the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu. For example, we can switch to presentation mode while we are doing our presentations. To do this, still, in the <strong class="bold">View</strong> menu, tap <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong> and then <strong class="bold">Enter Presentation Mode</strong>. This brings up a minimized UI, as shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19779_02_12.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 – Presentation Mode" width="1010" height="683"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.12 – Presentation Mode</p>
			<p>As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.12</em>, we<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> can see that the font size has increased, and the UI is very minimal. This mode is extremely helpful when doing presentations. To exit this mode, go to <strong class="bold">View</strong> and then tap <strong class="bold">Exit </strong><strong class="bold">Presentation Mode</strong>.</p>
			<p>At the bottom, we have some more useful tools as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B19779_02_13.jpg" alt="Figure 2.13 – Android Studio bottom tabs" width="1092" height="46"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.13 – Android Studio bottom tabs</p>
			<p>From <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.13</em>, let us learn what the tabs do:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">TODO</strong>: Shows all our to-do items. This is useful for keeping track of things you need to do.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Problems</strong>: Shows all the problems in our project. This is useful for keeping track of errors and warnings in our project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Terminal</strong>: Allows us to run terminal commands. This is useful for running commands such as Git<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> or <strong class="bold">Android Debug Bridge</strong> (<strong class="bold">ADB</strong>) commands.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">App Inspection</strong>: This allows us to inspect various elements in our app and is useful for debugging our app. It allows us to inspect our background jobs, database, and network requests. For the database, we can see the data in our database, and we can also run queries with the data. For network requests, we can see the network requests and their JSON responses. And for background jobs, we can see the jobs and their status. These are helpful for us to debug and check issues on our app.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Logcat</strong>: This shows all our log messages. It is especially useful for debugging errors as they arise.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">App Quality Insights</strong>: This allows us to view our app quality insights. This enables us to view crashes detected by Firebase Crashlytics inside our Android Studio. We can also see the crash stack trace and the line of code that has the issue, and we can easily navigate to that line from here.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build</strong>: Shows the build output. This is useful for debugging build errors.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Profiler</strong>: Allows us to profile our app. For the profiler to work, we must have an instance of our app running. The profiler is useful for debugging performance issues. This provides metrics on how our app is using the CPU, memory, and energy. We can<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> use these metrics to optimize our app.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These tabs can vary in position and at times some might not be shown. You can also easily add or remove them from the sidebar.</p>
			<p>Let us now look at some useful shortcuts inside Android Studio.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Some useful shortcuts</h2>
			<p>Shortcuts <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>help us quickly achieve things inside Android Studio. When well mastered, they can help us boost our productivity. There are many shortcuts available, and you can also customize and create your own. Some of the most common ones include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">Alt</em> + <em class="italic">7</em> on Windows or <em class="italic">Command</em> + <em class="italic">7</em> on Mac: This opens the <code>MainActivity.kt</code> file, we can see the following structure:</li>

			<p class="list-inset">From <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.14</em>, we can see <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>that the <code>MainActivity.kt</code> file. Clicking on a method from this tab quickly navigates us to the method in our code. There is also an icon, highlighted in red in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.14</em>, that shows the inherited methods. When we click this, it shows all the inherited methods in the file as well.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em class="italic">Alt</em> + <em class="italic">Enter</em> on Windows<a id="_idTextAnchor039"/> or <em class="italic">Option</em> + <em class="italic">Enter</em> on Mac: This allows us to quickly add imports for packages, files, or dependencies in our project. It also offers more functionality, such as providing quick fixes for errors and allowing us to implement methods.</li>
				<li>Double-press <em class="italic">Shift</em>: This opens the general search window. Here we can search for classes, symbols, and files all over the project.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">F</em> on Windows or <em class="italic">Command</em> + <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">F</em> on Mac: This is helpful for searching text in all files.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">F6</em> on Windows or <em class="italic">Command</em> + <em class="italic">F6</em>: This allows us to refactor code. We have renaming, changing method signatures, moving code, and many more.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">D</em> on Windows or <em class="italic">Command</em> + <em class="italic">D</em> on Mac: This is for duplicating a line of code or a selected section of code.</li>
				<li><em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">B</em> on <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>Windows or <em class="italic">Command</em> + <em class="italic">B</em> on Mac: This allows us to jump to declarations.</li>

			<p>We have only covered some of these shortcuts. There are many of them available. If you want to master most of these shortcuts, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>install the Key Promoter X plugin (<a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x">https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x</a>). The plugins remind you of the shortcut whenever you perform an action that has a shortcut, and it also prompts you to create shortcuts when you repetitively do something that does not have a shortcut.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we created our first Android app. We familiarized ourselves with Android Studio, the IDE that we use to develop Android apps. We also learned about some tips, shortcuts, and useful Android Studio features and understood the process of creating a project in Android Studio.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will be covering Jetpack Compose layout basics. We’ll start with an introduction to Jetpack Compose, a declarative way of declaring UIs for our apps.</p>
