- en: Every `Activity` within an app runs within the App Process, but each `Activity`
    is also subject to its own lifecycle. These are methods that are triggered by
    the platform when the `Activity` is about to change states, for example, when
    the user exits the `Activity` temporarily to use another `Activity` (whether it's
    in the same application, or another one). `Fragment` objects are also subject
    to a lifecycle, and while it mostly follows the same pattern as the `Activity`
    lifecycle, it also has the notion of being "attached" and "detached" from its
    parent `Activity`.
