            <p>Now that we have had a short tour of Xcode, it is time to start learning about Swift.
               Remember, if you are new to programming, things will be very different for you, so
               take your time. The important skills that you will learn here will set you up with
               a solid foundation in iOS development. If you have previous programming experience,
               you should still review this chapter, as it can only enhance your programming skills
               and act as a refresher for you.
            </p>
            
            <p>On June 2, 2014, Apple changed the game for iOS development, because this was the
               day Swift was announced to the world. With this announcement, everybody was put on
               an even playing field, because they had to learn a new programming language. Swift
               has brought a more modern approach to developing apps and has seen a huge influx of
               new developers of all ages wanting to build iOS apps. But enough about history! Let's
               dig in and see what you are going to learn.
            </p>
            
            <p>The following will be covered in this chapter:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Playgrounds</li>
               
               <li>Data types</li>
               
               <li>Variables and constants</li>
               
               <li>Debug and print()</li>
               
               <li>Comments</li>
               
            </ul>

            <h1 class="header-title">Playgrounds – an interactive coding environment</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Before we jump into building the app that we will be creating in later chapters, called
               <em>Let's Eat</em>, we need to understand the basics of Swift. An easy way to experiment with Swift
               is to use <strong>Playgrounds</strong>. It is an interactive coding environment that evaluates your code and displays the
               results. Using Playgrounds gives us the ability to work with Swift without needing
               to create a project. It is great for prototyping a particular part of your app. So,
               whether you are learning or experimenting, Playgrounds are an invaluable tool. In
               order to create a Playground, we need to launch Xcode and click on <span class="packt_screen">Get started with a playground</span>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/65b9d922-884d-4677-b854-1ad838c5d5a6.png"/></div>
            
            <p>The <span class="packt_screen">Playground</span> template screen will appear. Make sure that you select <span class="packt_screen">iOS</span>, then choose <span class="packt_screen">Blank</span> and hit <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/433abbf3-0b74-4b50-9c3b-82eaa0b508be.png"/></div>
            
            <p>You will be asked to give your project a name and a location to save the file; name
               your new <kbd>Playground iOS11-Programming-for-Beginners-Ch2</kbd>. You can save the file anywhere that you like. Now, with the project saved, we can
               explore Playgrounds a bit.
            </p>
            
            <p>When you launch the app, you will see five distinct areas:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/19b461bc-b021-4f0d-a56b-6d7da497c1d8.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Let's break down each area in Playgrounds:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><strong>Playground editor</strong>: This area is where you will write all of your code.
               </li>
               
               <li><strong>Results panel</strong>: The <strong>Results panel</strong> is a feature only found in Playgrounds and provides immediate feedback.
               </li>
               
               <li><strong>Window Pane Controls</strong>: The <strong>Window Pane Controls</strong> have two groups of icons:
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/bcad7c34-233b-4a9e-9bb7-74565719d58a.png"/></div>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 60px">As we discussed earlier, the first group is called the <strong>Editor Mode</strong> and the second group is called the <strong>View</strong>. Refer to the detailed description of these icons in the previous chapter for information
               about what each does.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><strong>Debug toggle</strong>: This button allows you to hide and show the Debug panel and toggle on the Debug
                  panel.
               </li>
               
               <li><strong>Play/Stop</strong>: This button is used in order to make Playgrounds executes code or to stop Playgrounds
                  from running. Typically, Playgrounds runs on its own, but sometimes you need to manually
                  toggle this feature on when Playgrounds does not execute your code for you.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Now that we have our setup finished, delete everything in this file. Your Playground
               should have three open panels: your Playground editor, the Results panel, and the
               Debug panel. Let's start digging into some code.
            </p>

            <h1 class="header-title">Data types – where it all starts</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Swift offers a collection of built-in data types. Its data types are string, integer,
               floating-point numbers, and Booleans. These data types can be found in most programming
               languages. Therefore, if you are not new to programming, you can skip this section
               and start at the variables and constants—where data is held section later.
            </p>
            
            <p>Let's walk-through each data type for those of you who are new to programming or would
               like a refresher.
            </p>
            
            
            
         </article>

      <section>
         
         
         <header>
            
            <h1 class="header-title">String</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>The first data type we will discuss is string. A string is represented by a series
               of characters. Strings are used to display text in an app. When a string is wrapped
               in quotes, it is known as a string literal. In programming, we cannot just add text
               into Playgrounds. So, in order to write a string, we must wrap our string inside quotes.
            </p>
            
            <p>Let's now add our name into Playgrounds wrapped in quotes:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/89055737-bc66-4b78-8871-fe1ed1171502.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In Playgrounds, your values also will appear inside of your Results panel. So, we
               now know that, in order to create a String, we need to use quotes.
            </p>
            
            
            
         </article>
         
         
         
      </section>
      
   

      
      <section>
         
         
         <header>
            
            <h1 class="header-title">Integer data type</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p><strong>Integers</strong> (<strong>Ints</strong>) are whole numbers, such as 32 and −100. Integers are useful for when you need to
               do calculations (that is, adding, subtracting, multiplication, and so on). Let's add
               some numbers into Playgrounds. On the next line, under your name, type 32 and then,
               on the following line, −100:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/9929077d-62dd-499e-8ca4-6f4fb0bdd629.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Again, you will see both <kbd>32</kbd> and <kbd>−100</kbd> in the Results panel under your name.
            </p>

            <p>Floating-point numbers are numbers with a fractional component, such as <kbd>4.993</kbd>, <kbd>0.5</kbd>, and <kbd>−234.99</kbd>. Let's add these values into Playgrounds as well:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/da8117fe-e328-4cd4-afa4-feac4b294784.png"/></div>

         <article>
            
            
            <p><strong>Booleans</strong> (<strong>bools</strong> for short), are referred to as logical, because they either can be true or false.
               Booleans are used when you need to determine whether some logic is true or false.
               For example, did the user log in? This statement would either be true, yes, they did
               or false, no, they did not. So, in Playgrounds, add <kbd>true</kbd> and <kbd>false</kbd>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/19f5f763-02ff-4784-a9b3-1b1588476ca1.png"/></div>
            
            <p>So, now we covered all of the basic data types in Swift. Right now, we have no way
               to use these data types. This is where variables and constants come into play.

            <p>Variables and constants are like a container that holds some kind of data. When you
               want to declare a variable, you have to use the var keyword. Let's declare each of
               the data types we did earlier, but, this time, using variables and constants instead.

            <p>First, delete what you have entered into Playgrounds already, and now let's declare
               our first variable, named <kbd>fullName</kbd>, and set it to your name:
            </p>
            <pre>var fullName = "Craig Clayton"</pre>
            <p>The preceding code says that we have a variable named <kbd>fullName</kbd> and that it is holding a string value of <kbd>Craig Clayton</kbd>. Your Results panel will have your actual name as its data:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/16fd8a53-0c58-45e7-98b0-3f854449e2c4.png"/></div>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>Now, let's create a variable with an Int called <kbd>age</kbd> and set it to our age (or whatever you want your age to be) by adding the following:
            </p>
            <pre>var age = 40</pre>
            <p>Our program now knows that age is an Int. You should see both your name and age in
               the Results panel, just like you did previously:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/f3c5140e-6af4-4055-a493-7a7a2b674ae3.png"/></div>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>We can use the Debug panel (at the bottom of the following screenshot) using <kbd>print()</kbd>. So, let's see how <kbd>print()</kbd> works by printing both our name and age. We can do this by adding the following:
            </p>
            <pre>print(fullName)<br/>print(age)</pre>
            <p>It should appear on your screen as follows:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/82e985a4-e794-41f8-a484-6f489146e00c.png"/></div>
            
            <p>You should now see the output in both the Results and Debug panels. Using <kbd>print()</kbd> allows us to see things in our Debug panel and therefore verify expected results.
               This is a very useful debugging tool.
            </p>

            <h1 class="header-title">Adding floating-point numbers</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Let's now add floating-point numbers, using the <kbd>let</kbd> constant in the Playground:
            </p>
            <pre>let gradeAvg = 2.9<br/>let version = 1.1</pre>
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/dcad6425-1a30-41cd-8edd-a1ec36c67b2c.png"/></div>
            
            <p>You will notice that a couple of things are different. First, we are using the <kbd>let</kbd> keyword. Using <kbd>let</kbd> tells our program that this is a constant. Constants are variables that cannot be
               changed once they are set (as opposed to a non-constant variable, which can be changed
               after being set).
            </p>
            
            <p>The other thing you might have noticed is that we explicitly set our <kbd>version</kbd> to <kbd>Float</kbd>. When dealing with a floating-point number, it can be a <kbd>Double</kbd> or a <kbd>Float</kbd>. Without getting too technical, a <kbd>Double</kbd> is much more precise than a <kbd>Float</kbd>. The best way to explain this is to use pi as an example. Pi is a number in which
               the digits go on forever. Well, we cannot use a number that goes on forever; however,
               a <kbd>Double</kbd> and <kbd>Float</kbd> will handle how precise that number will be. Let's look at the following diagram
               to see what I mean by precise:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="82" src="assets/e668a654-f4bb-42b6-98c1-502828d4778b.png" width="246"/></div>
            
            <p>So, in the preceding example, you can see that <kbd>Float</kbd> will only display <kbd>3.14</kbd>, whereas <kbd>Double</kbd> will give you a much more accurate number. In Swift, a <kbd>Double</kbd> is preferred. Therefore, if you do not explicitly set the floating-point number to
               a <kbd>Float</kbd>, Swift will default it to a <kbd>Double</kbd>. To set <kbd>version</kbd> to a <kbd>Float</kbd>, you must purposely set it that way.
            </p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>Now it is time to create a <kbd>Bool</kbd>, and we will make it a constant. Enter the following code:
            </p>
            <pre>let isConstant:Bool = true</pre>
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="145" src="assets/8fd05ea6-16c7-43f9-9c42-72e57ec3a733.png" width="513"/></div>
            
            <p>Since <kbd>isConstant</kbd> is set, let's make it <kbd>false</kbd> by adding this:
            </p>
            <pre>isConstant = false</pre>
            <p>On the same line as what you just entered, you now will see a red circle with a white
               dot. The red circle means that there is an error. The white circle inside of it means
               that Xcode can fix the error for you (most of the time):
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="281" src="assets/aa5ab7ca-0c35-4b10-8e89-f31bfc208323.png" width="501"/></div>
            
            <p>You also will notice an error in your Debug panel, which is just a more detailed version
               of the error. This error is telling us that we are trying to change the value of a
               constant when we cannot do so.
            </p>
            
            <p>If you tap on the circle, you will see that Playgrounds suggests that you change the
               <kbd>var</kbd> to a <kbd>let</kbd>, since you cannot assign a value to a constant:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/67884f47-c0fd-49d8-bb25-5ab969ac9a03.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Since we want it to remain a constant, let's delete the line <kbd>isConstant = false</kbd>. We have covered basic data types, but there are some other programming basics we
               should discuss as well.
            </p>

            <p>Typically, I like to use Hungarian notation when writing variables, because it acts
               as an identifier for the data type of the variable. For example, earlier we wrote
               <kbd>fullName</kbd> and <kbd>gradeAvg</kbd>. Throughout this book, you will see that I use Hungarian notation.

         <article>
            
            
            <p>You might be asking yourself "<em>Why would you ever want to make something constant?"</em> Since constants cannot change after you run your app, they keep you from accidentally
               changing a value that should not be changed. Another really good use for constants
               is for base URLs, as you would not want these to change. When you are getting data,
               you do not want to accidentally change the value midway through your app. Apple recommends
               that you use <kbd>let</kbd> whenever possible. Typically, I will use a <kbd>let</kbd> until Xcode warns me that a <kbd>var</kbd> is preferable. If I change the value from <kbd>let</kbd> to <kbd>var</kbd>, then I am verifying that this is the behavior I want.
            </p>

            <p>Comments are a great way to create notes or reminders to yourself. When you comment
               code, it means that it will not be executed when your code runs. There are two types
               of comment used: <kbd>//</kbd> or <kbd>/* */</kbd>. <kbd>//</kbd> is typically used for a one-line comment and <kbd>/**/</kbd> is used for a block of text.
            </p>
            
            <p>You can add comments to your code, such as a To-Do item or just a brief explanation
               of what something is doing.
            </p>
            
            <p>Let's see what both of these look like:</p>

            <h1 class="header-title">Type safety and type inference</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Swift is a type-safe language, which means that you are encouraged to be clear about
               the value types with which your code will work. Type inference means that, before
               your code runs, it will be able to quickly check to ensure that you did not set anything
               to a different type. If you do, Xcode will give you an error. Why is this good? Let's
               say that you have an app in the store and that you set one of your variables as a
               <kbd>String</kbd> in one part of your code, but then accidentally set the same variable as an <kbd>Int</kbd> in another part of your code. This error may cause some bad behavior in your app
               that could cause it to crash. Finding these kinds of error is like finding a needle
               in a haystack. Therefore, type checking helps you write safer code by helping you
               avoid errors when working with different types.
            </p>
            
            <p>We have now looked at data types and know that strings are for textual data, <kbd>Int</kbd> for integer, <kbd>Bool</kbd> for boolean, and <kbd>Double</kbd> and <kbd>Float</kbd> for floating-point numbers. Let's look a bit deeper into data types and see how we
               can do more than just assign them to variables.
            </p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>String concatenation is the result of combining multiple string literals together
               to form an expression. So, let's create one by first entering two String literals:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/b5d2aeaf-9c6b-4858-8b28-5d08d6878a33.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Combining these two gives us a String concatenation. We can combine Strings by using
               the <kbd>+</kbd> operator. Add the following:
            </p>
            <pre>let full = firstName + lastName</pre>
            <p>When you look in the Results panel, you will notice that there is no space between
               our first and last names.
            </p>
            
            <p>In addition, if we just put the variables in quotes, they will revert to simple string
               literals and will no longer be variables.
            </p>
            
            
            
         </article>

            <h1 class="header-title">String interpolation</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>In order to correct that, we can put these variables inside of quotes, which is known
               as string interpolation, using a backslash and parentheses around each of our variables
               inside of the string interpolation. Let's update our name variable to be the following,
               and you will see the space in the name in the Results panel:
            </p>
            <pre>let full = "\(firstName) \(lastName)"</pre>
            <p>After adding the line our code should look something like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/2f50d91b-9c5d-4d89-9fdc-2b208fda901f.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now that we know about using variables inside of quotes, we can do the same inside
               of <kbd>print()</kbd>. Let's put the <kbd>firstName</kbd> and <kbd>lastName</kbd> inside of <kbd>print()</kbd>, as follows:
            </p>
            <pre>print("\(firstName) \(lastName)")</pre>
            <p>The <kbd>print</kbd> statements are great for checking to see you are getting the value you want:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/47d7a10c-f3f6-4814-8588-c5ca378b45f5.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Bam! Now, we have a way to see multiple variables inside of <kbd>print()</kbd> and to create string interpolation by combining multiple strings together. We can
               do much more with <kbd>Strings</kbd>, and we will cover them later in the book.
            </p>

            <h1 class="header-title">Operations with our integers</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>In our Playground, we know that age is an Int, but with <kbd>Int</kbd>, we also can write arithmetic expressions using numbers, variables/constants, operators,
               and parentheses. Let's start with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
               Add the following into Xcode:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/57153a96-0333-41a6-bd47-9b93c6c85049.png"/></div>
            
            <p>So, sum added two integers (<kbd>+</kbd> operator) together, totaling <kbd>43</kbd> in our preceding example. Then, we subtracted (<kbd>-</kbd> operator) sum from <kbd>32</kbd> to create result (<kbd>−11</kbd> in our example). After that, we took result and multiplied (<kbd>*</kbd> operator) it by <kbd>5</kbd> (see <kbd>-55</kbd> in the Results panel). All of this is pretty basic math; however, you may have noticed
               something different with our division equation (<kbd>/</kbd> operator). When you divide two integers, the result will be a third integer. So,
               instead of <kbd>-55</kbd> divided by <kbd>10</kbd> equaling <kbd>-5.5</kbd>, our result was <kbd>-5</kbd>. In order to get the correct floating-point value of <kbd>-5.5</kbd>, we need to make our division value a <kbd>Double</kbd>. Therefore, let's add the following:
            </p>
            <pre>let divide2 = Double(total) / 10</pre>
            <p>After adding the preceding line of code, your code should look something like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/91f50dd7-30e7-4337-b5bd-63d3b83a7f34.png"/></div>
            
            <p>All of these operations will look familiar to you, but there is one with which you
               might not be familiar and that is the remainder operator. The remainder operator returns
               the remainder when one number is divided by another.
            </p>
            
            <p>So, for example, <kbd>7</kbd> divided by <kbd>3</kbd> equals <kbd>2.33</kbd>. When we apply the remainder operator, we get back <kbd>1</kbd>. Add the following to Playgrounds:
            </p>
            <pre>let mod = 7 % 3</pre>
            <p>Now, your code should look something like this:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/e930997d-b3b2-45a1-a7e4-356de45d163e.png"/></div>

            <p>There will be times when you need to increment (increase) or decrement (decrease)
               a value. There are two ways you can accomplish this. Add the following into Playgrounds:
            </p>

            <p>We have hit the basics and, from this point, if you are new to programming it is a
               good idea to make sure that you understand each topic we covered. As the chapters
               progress, we will cover more and more so take your time and really make sure that
               you are comfortable with all of the topics in this chapter.
