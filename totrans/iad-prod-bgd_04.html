The example project has several warnings, mostly like "The page named 'Page 1' has not been changed". This warning is generated as we haven't applied a template or changed this page. Go through each of the 'has not been changed' errors and add a template and some custom content.<a class="indexterm" id="id183"/>
</p><p>Other common warnings include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">"The object with outlet 'video' on page 'Preroll Video' is missing one or more required attributes": This warning can be safely ignored if you don't have any pre-roll in your ad; if you do, make sure you have added the video to the preroll tab on the splash page.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">"Image asset 'image-name' height/width is greater than containing component ImageView1's height/width": This means the dimensions of an image are larger than the dimensions of the view that contains it, and you can resize the image (and reduce the file size), as it's bigger than it needs to be.</li></ul></div><p>Don't worry if you can't fix all the warnings, as long as you know them and are conscious of the implications.<a class="indexterm" id="id184"/>

<span class="emphasis"><em>I've reduced the size of my images, but iAd Producer is still showing warnings or errors</em></span>.</p><p>Large image sizes can be reduced by ensuring you're using the right type of image; for example, if you don't need transparency then make sure you're using JPG for your image. When saving a JPG image in Preview, we can increase the compression level to reduce the file size. Select<span class="strong"><strong> File</strong></span>, then<span class="strong"><strong> Save as</strong></span>, from the menu bar in Preview, and change the quality slider until the image size reduces to an acceptable level. Keep in mind, though, that reducing the quality of your images too much can cause blocky and pixelated images. Experiment with different quality levels until you find an acceptable trade-off. In the following screenshot, you can see an example of the quality and file size dialogue when saving an image:<a class="indexterm" id="id186"/>

<span class="emphasis"><em>My ad performs great in the simulator, but it's really slow on the device</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id187"/>
</p><p>Your Mac has considerably more resources and power than your iOS device (although they're quickly catching up), so you're likely to see some performance degradation when testing on the device.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note76"/>Note</h3><p>This is why you should test on the device often throughout the development cycle. You'll be able to catch issues early and track down the cause. Make sure you test on different device models, as well, since certain devices have more power than others.</p></div><p>Typically, the performance of your iAd can be optimized by isolating the component that is slowing the ad down; check for elements with the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Large shadows:</strong></span> Each shadow has to be dynamically drawn onto your iAd, and larger shadows take longer to generate. Try reducing the distance and blur of your shadows if you're seeing poor performance.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Slow or jumpy animations:</strong></span> Objects won't animate smoothly if there isn't enough power in the device to redraw each frame of the motion. Typically, this will occur if you have too many animations occurring at once, or the animated elements have too many styles applied to them. Try reducing the amount of items that are concurrently animated, and remove or reduce intensive styles, such as shadows, reflections, or opacity.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Images briefly only showing a section of them:</strong></span> This is often caused by your iAd not prefetching the assets used by your ad. iAd Producer only enables the prefetching on exported optimized ads, so when you test your ad on the iAd Test Server, you shouldn't see this occur as often.<a class="indexterm" id="id188"/></li></ol></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note77"/>Note</h3><p>Even when your exported iAd is optimized, you still might see images partially appear whilst they download. An optimized ad starts downloaded assets before they're needed; but, if you're on a slow connection, or have many assets, they may not be downloaded before you need them.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Imported images appear small"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec06"/>Imported images appear small</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>When I open images in iAd Producer, they're smaller than I expected</em></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id189"/>
</p><p>iAd Producer assumes you're importing high resolution images for the retina displays, so it reduces the visible size of your image by half to accommodate this. You should always export your images at double the horizontal and vertical resolution that you want them to appear as.</p><p>For example, if you have a full-screen image, export it at 960px by 640px, double the standard screen size of 480px by 320px.</p><p>You should try to keep your source images as large as possible, as it's easy to scale images down, but impossible to make them larger without any loss of quality.<a class="indexterm" id="id190"/>
