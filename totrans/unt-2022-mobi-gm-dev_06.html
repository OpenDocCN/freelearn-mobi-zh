			<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/>Implementing In-App Purchases</h1>
			<p>As mentioned in <a href="B18868_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor232"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Advertising Using Unity Ads</em>, there are many options out there when it comes to selling your game on a mobile platform. If you decide to go free-to-play, in addition to showing ads, there is also the ability to sell people additional content and/or advantages through the use of <strong class="bold">In-App Purchases</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAPs</strong>). This can <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>be a way to engage users of your game and convert them from free players into paying customers.</p>
			<p>Typically, these can be options such as removing ads or offering themes to players, but you can also do things such as unlock new levels and add additional content so that people addicted to your game will be clamoring to give you more of their time. Alternatively, you can also think of your IAPs as items that players will want to buy in order to enhance their gameplay experiences, such as power-ups and upgrades.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will integrate Unity’s IAP system into our project and take a look at how to create an IAP that is for consumable content as well as permanently unlocking features. By the end of the chapter, we will see how to set up Unity’s IAP system and create our first possible purchasable item, and then we will see how to restore purchases on certain devices before seeing additional resources for the various app stores that exist.</p>
			<p>This chapter is split into a number of topics. It contains a simple step-by-step process from beginning to end. The following is the outline of our tasks:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting up Unity IAP</li>
				<li>Creating our first purchase</li>
				<li><a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>Adding a button to restore purchases</li>
				<li>Configuring purchases for the stores of your choice</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>Setting up Unity IAP</h1>
			<p>Unity IAP is a service that <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>allows us to sell a variety of different items to players within our game projects and is currently supported by the iOS App Store, Mac App Store, Google Play, Windows Store, Amazon Appstore, and more, by default. So, using this, we can easily sell our items in many different places. We have already set up Unity Services in <a href="B18868_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor232"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Advertising Using Unity Ads</em>, so this will be a lot easier to get going. Perform the following steps to add Unity IAP:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">Services</strong> window by going to <strong class="bold">Window</strong> | <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong>, and then click on the <strong class="bold">Services</strong> button on the top toolbar.</li>
				<li>From there, scroll down to the <strong class="bold">In App Purchasing</strong> item and then click on the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_01.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1: The In App Purchasing option from Package Manager"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.1: The In App Purchasing option from Package Manager</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3"> A window will pop up asking for you to confirm that you would like to activate the <strong class="bold">Purchasing</strong> service package. Click on the <strong class="bold">Ok</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_02.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2: Activating the Purchasing service"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.2: Activating the Purchasing service</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Once completed, you can close out of <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong> and then go into the <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> menu by going to <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> | <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> and then going to the <strong class="bold">Services</strong> section. If all went well, you should<a id="_idIndexMarker425"/> see an <strong class="bold">In-App Purchases</strong> menu section. Select it and you should notice that it has been toggled on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">The IAP package is created externally from the main engine itself because the code is meant to be extremely flexible and can be updated to fit any policies that are needed. We can then just update the package instead of having to update it to the latest version of Unity, which can be very important when working on a large project.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_03.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3: In-App Purchases are enabled"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.3: In-App Purchases are enabled</p>
			<p>Now that we have the IAP system brought into our project, we can now utilize it to create our first purchasable<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> object for our players.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84">C<a id="_idTextAnchor211"/><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>reating our first purchase</h2>
			<p>To make our first in-app purchase, we will make<a id="_idIndexMarker427"/> use of a feature of Unity that was just added<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> to our project, Codeless IAP. It is called Codeless IAP because you do not need to write any code for the actual IAP transaction, just the script that defines what users get if they make a purchase. It’s by far the easiest way to integrate IAPs into Unity games and a great way to start trying out IAPs in our project.</p>
			<p>One of the most common IAPs <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>is the ability to disable advertisements in mobile games. Using the following steps, let’s add that functionality by creating a button that, when clicked, will disable advertisements:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open up our Main Menu level by going to the <code>Assets/Scenes</code> folder, and then double-clicking on the <code>MainMenu</code> file.</li>
				<li>From there, return to the <strong class="bold">Scene</strong> window if not there already, and then click on the <strong class="bold">2D</strong> button to go into 2D mode since we’ll be working with the UI.</li>
				<li>We will first need to have something to sell and to do that, we will use the IAP Catalog, which we can access by going to <strong class="bold">Services</strong> | <strong class="bold">In-App Purchasing</strong> | <strong class="bold">IAP Catalog…</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_04.jpg" alt="Figure 6.4: Opening the IAP Catalog"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.4: Opening the IAP Catalog</p>
			<p>Once we get to the menu, it should look something like this:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_05.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5: The IAP Catalog"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.5: The IAP Catalog</p>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>Now, the first thing we’ll need to do is create<a id="_idIndexMarker430"/> an ID for our product, which is how we will identify our product in different app stores. In our case, let’s go with <code>removeAds</code>. Then, under <strong class="bold">Type</strong>, change it to <strong class="bold">Non Consumable</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_06.jpg" alt="Figure 6.6: Creating an IAP"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.6: Creating an IAP</p>
			<p>By non-consumable, we mean<a id="_idIndexMarker431"/> that the players only need to buy this once, and the game will keep that in mind for later. The others are consumable, meaning that they are used for things that can be bought over and over again, such as special power-ups and subscriptions. These give access to some kind of content for a period of time, possibly recurring until a user cancels them.</p>
			<p>4.	Next, we can close out of <strong class="bold">IAP Catalog</strong> by clicking on <strong class="bold">X</strong> in the top-right corner of the window.</p>
			<p>5.	Select the <strong class="bold">Canvas - Scale Physical</strong> object in the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window. From there, select <strong class="bold">Services</strong> | <strong class="bold">In-App Purchasing </strong>| <strong class="bold">Create IAP Button</strong>, and we should see a new button created in our scene:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_07.jpg" alt="Figure 6.7: Creating an IAP button"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.7: Creating an IAP button</p>
			<p>This button will be used to perform an IAP to remove the ads in the game. The button currently uses Unity’s legacy text system, but it can easily be adjusted to use <code>TextMeshPro</code> if you’d like.</p>
			<p>To ensure that both the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> and <strong class="bold">Remove Ads</strong> buttons show up correctly on the screen, we will create<a id="_idIndexMarker432"/> a menu that can hold both of them. This means creating another panel as a child of our Safe Area panel.</p>
			<p>From the <code>SafeAreaHolder</code>.</p>
			<p>6.	Afterward, create a child <code>SafeAreaHolder</code> and have it fill the entire screen as done before. Add a <code>10</code>.</p>
			<p>7.	Then, add a <strong class="bold">Content Size Fitter</strong> component and set the <strong class="bold">Vertical Fit</strong> and <strong class="bold">Horizontal Fit</strong> fields to <strong class="bold">Preferred Size</strong>.</p>
			<p>8.	Rename the newly added<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> button <code>Remove Ads Button</code> and then add a <code>10</code> and at the <code>Remove </code><code>Ads</code> instead.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">For a reminder on what these instructions mean and what each step does, check out <a href="B18868_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Resolution-Independent U<a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>I</em>.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Finally, drag and drop the two buttons onto the <strong class="bold">Panel</strong> object, with the <strong class="bold">Play</strong> button in the top half and the <strong class="bold">Remove Ads</strong> button below it, as follows:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_08.jpg" alt="Figure 6.8: The Remove Ads button added to the scene"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.8: The Remove Ads button added to the scene</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Next, with the <code>IAP Button</code> class has an <strong class="bold">On Purchase Complete (Product)</strong> function, which works similarly to <strong class="bold">On Click</strong> as we’ve used with <strong class="bold">Button</strong> components in the past. With that in mind, we will need to create a function<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> that we would like to call when the player presses the button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In <a href="B18868_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor232"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a><em class="italic">,</em> <em class="italic">Advertising Using Unity Ads</em>, we created a <code>static</code> variable inside the <code>UnityAdController</code> class called <code>showAds</code>. We will use this variable to check whether we should show ads<a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>.</p>
			<p>We will need to open up the <code>MainMenuBehaviour</code> script and add the following functions to the class:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public void DisableAds()
{
    UnityAdController.showAds = false;
    /* Used to store that we shouldn't show ads */
    PlayerPrefs.SetInt("Show Ads", 0);
}
protected virtual void Start()
{
    /* Initialize the showAds variable */
    bool showAds = (PlayerPrefs.GetInt("Show Ads", 1)
        == 1);
    UnityAdController.showAds = showAds;
}</pre>
			<p>Here, we are using Unity’s <code>PlayerPrefs</code> system in order to save whether a player should be shown ads or not. <code>PlayerPrefs</code> is cool because it saves information between playthroughs<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> of the game and is used often for things such as high scores and player preferences (hence the name). To reset the properties for testing, you can go to <code>PlayerPrefs</code> may be removed if the app is uninstalled or if the app’s data is cleared, so we will later add a <strong class="bold">Restore Purchases</strong> button that will allow the players to restore their purchases on platforms that allow it. For platforms that don’t, you’ll want to make an API call to the server to check whether the current user has already purchased the non-consumable IAP item. More details on this will be covered in the <em class="italic">Adding a button to restore purchases</em> section of this chapter.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">For more<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> information on PlayerPrefs, check out <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html</a>.</p>
			<p>Note that I made the <code>Start</code> function <code>virtual</code>, which means that inherited classes can also use this as a foundation for their own scripts. We also marked the function as <code>protected</code>, which works the same as a <code>private</code> function but it also is accessible in child classes.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">With that in mind, we will also need to update the <code>Start</code> function of <code>PauseScreenBehaviour</code> to the following:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">protected override void Start()</strong>
{
    /* Initialize Ads if needed */
<strong class="bold">    base.Start();</strong>
    if (!UnityAdController.showAds)
    {
        /* If not showing ads, just start the game */
        SetPauseMenu(false);
    }
}</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <code>override</code> keyword will replace the default behavior of <code>Start</code>. However, when we call <code>base.Start()</code>, we are ensuring that the preceding content from <code>MainMenuBehaviour</code> will be called—in this case, we ensure that <code>UnityAdController</code> has the correct value set.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Finally, we will need<a id="_idIndexMarker437"/> to adjust the <code>ObstacleBehaviour</code> script to handle not playing ads as well. Update the <code>ShowContinue</code> function to use the following:<pre class="source-code">
    // Other code above...
    /* Come back after 1 second and check again */
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(1f);
}
<strong class="bold">else if (!UnityAdController.showAds)</strong>
<strong class="bold">{</strong>
<strong class="bold">    /* It's valid to click the button now */</strong>
<strong class="bold">    contButton.interactable = true;</strong>
<strong class="bold">    /* If player clicks on button we want to just</strong>
<strong class="bold">       continue */</strong>
<strong class="bold">    contButton.onClick.AddListener(Continue);</strong>
<strong class="bold">    UnityAdController.obstacle = this;</strong>
<strong class="bold">    /* Change text to allow continue */</strong>
<strong class="bold">    btnText.text = "Free Continue";</strong>
<strong class="bold">    /* We can now leave the coroutine */</strong>
<strong class="bold">    break;</strong>
}
else
{
    /* It's valid to click the button now */
    contButton.interactable = true;
    // More code below...</pre></li>
				<li>We will also need to make<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> a slight adjustment to the <code>ResetGame</code> method by removing or commenting out the following lines:<pre class="source-code">
/*If we find the button, we can use it */
if (continueButton)
{
    //if (UnityAdController.showAds)
    //{
        // If a player clicks on a button, we want to
           play an ad
        // and then continue
        StartCoroutine(ShowContinue(continueButton));
    //}
    //else
    //{
        /* If we can't play an ad, no need for the
           continue button */
    //    continueButton.gameObject.SetActive(false);
    //}
}</pre></li>
				<li>Save your script and dive into Unity.</li>
				<li>From the <code>Main Menu</code> object to the little box below the <strong class="bold">Runtime Only</strong> dropdown. Then, select <strong class="bold">Main Menu Behaviour</strong> | <strong class="bold">DisableAds</strong> from the dropdown to the right:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_09.jpg" alt="Figure 6.9: Adding the DisableAds function call to Purc﻿hase"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.9: Adding the DisableAds function call to Purc<a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>hase</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">Now, save our scene and start the game:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_10.jpg" alt="Figure 6.10: The purchase menu appears to work correctly"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.10: The purchase menu appears to work correctly</p>
			<p>Now, if we click on the <strong class="bold">Remove Ads</strong> button, it will ask<a id="_idIndexMarker440"/> whether we want to make the purchase. If we do, it will then make it so that when we go into the game, there are no ads. Likewise, now when we die, it will display a <strong class="bold">Free </strong><strong class="bold">Continue</strong> but<a id="_idTextAnchor218"/>ton:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_11.jpg" alt="Figure 6.11: Making sure the purchase works correctly"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.11: Making sure the purchase works correctly</p>
			<p>With that, we now have created a simple purchase in Unity.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you’re interested in learning<a id="_idIndexMarker441"/> more about Codeless IAP, checkout <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPCodelessIAP.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPCodelessIAP.html</a>.</p>
			<p>With this, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker442"/> now build as many products as you’d like to have in your game. However, certain platforms also have requirements with regard to the functionality to restore previous purchases. In the next section, we will see how to do <a id="_idTextAnchor219"/><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/><a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>that.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Adding a button to restore purchases</h1>
			<p>On platforms<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> that support it (Google Play and Universal Windows Applications, most notably), if you purchase<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> something, uninstall, and then reinstall a game using Unity IAP, it automatically restores any products the user owned during the first initialization following reinstallation.</p>
			<p>For those on iOS, users must have the ability to restore their purchases via a button due to Apple requiring them to reauthenticate their password beforehand. Not doing so will prevent our game from being accepted on the iOS App Store, so it’s a good idea to include this functionality if we wish to deploy it there. Let’s look at the steps to do just that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the <strong class="bold">Hierarchy</strong> window and select the <strong class="bold">Remove Ads Button</strong> object. Once selected, duplicate it by pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl + </em><em class="italic">D</em>.</li>
				<li>Change the duplicate’s name by selecting it and changing its name to <code>Restore Button</code> in the <strong class="bold">Inspector</strong> window.</li>
				<li>From the <code>Restore Purchases</code> as well.</li>
				<li>Now, select the <strong class="bold">Restore</strong> object, and then, in the <strong class="bold">IAP Button</strong> component, go to <strong class="bold">Button Type</strong> and select <strong class="bold">Restore</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_12.jpg" alt="Figure 6.12: Adding the Restore button"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.12: Adding the Restore button</p>
			<p>You should note<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> that the properties of the <strong class="bold">IAP Button</strong> component<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> have changed and now only allow you to set <strong class="bold">Button Type</strong>, as there is nothing left to <a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>customize.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Save your scene and jump into Unity.</li>
				<li>When you start the game and try to click on <strong class="bold">Restore</strong>, you’ll get a warning in the <strong class="bold">Console</strong> window stating that this isn’t a supported platform:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_13.jpg" alt="Figure 6.13: Warning upon trying to restore on Windows"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.13: Warning upon trying to restore on Windows</p>
			<p>So, with that in mind, we can adjust our game so that the button will only show up if we are currently running on a supported platform.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="7">Go to the <code>Scripts</code> folder and create<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> a C# script called <code>RestoreAdsChecker</code>. Once it opens, use <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>the following script for it:<pre class="source-code">
using UnityEngine;
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Will show or remove a button depending on whether
/// we can restore ads or not
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public class RestoreAdsChecker : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Use this for initialization
    void Start()
    {
        bool canRestore = false;
        switch (Application.platform)
        {
            // Windows Store
            case RuntimePlatform.WSAPlayerX86:
            case RuntimePlatform.WSAPlayerX64:
            case RuntimePlatform.WSAPlayerARM:
            // iOS, OSX, tvOS
            case RuntimePlatform.IPhonePlayer:
            case RuntimePlatform.OSXPlayer:
            case RuntimePlatform.tvOS:
                canRestore = true;
                break;
        }
        gameObject.SetActive(canRestore);
    }
}</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This script goes through all of the stores listed in Unity’s <code>IAPButton</code> class, and if they are something that can be restored, we set <code>canRestore</code> to <code>true</code>; otherwise, it will stay <code>false</code>. Finally, we will remove<a id="_idIndexMarker449"/> the object if we cannot restore it, without having<a id="_idIndexMarker450"/> to create specific things for different builds.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="8">Save the script and dive back into Unity.</li>
				<li>Attach our newly created <code>RestoreAdsChecker</code> component to our <strong class="bold">Restore </strong><strong class="bold">Button </strong>object:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B18868_06_14.jpg" alt="Figure 6.14: Adding the Restore Ads Checke﻿r component"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.14: Adding the Restore Ads Checke<a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>r component</p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.15: The result of the RestoreAdsChecker component</p>
			<p>Now, due to the <strong class="bold">RestoreAdsChecker </strong>component that we added on our PC build of the game, the <strong class="bold">Restore</strong> button doesn’t show up, but if we export for iOS, it will show up on our device!</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">For more information on restoring transactions and how this functionally works, check out <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPRestoringTransactions.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPRestoringTransactions.html</a>.</p>
			<p>This ensures that our game<a id="_idIndexMarker453"/> has this particular feature on each<a id="_idIndexMarker454"/> of the different platforms that support it. With that in mind, we will next look at some of the specific stores and places you may wish to add support for IAPs<a id="_idTextAnchor225"/><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/> in your game.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Configuring purchases for the stores of your choice</h2>
			<p>Unfortunately, we do not have enough<a id="_idIndexMarker455"/> room in the book to go step by step through the process for every store, but I do have pages that you can reference to go through the entire process for the following stores:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Apple App Store and Mac App Store: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPAppleConfiguration.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPAppleConfiguration.html</a></li>

			<p>There are some potential issues when trying to publish to multiple Android IAP stores (such as Samsung and Google) with the same build. You can find<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> information on resolving those issues at <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPCrossStoreInstallationIssues.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPCrossStoreInstallationIssues.html</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered how to create IAPs by making use of Unity in your project. We first covered how to set up Unity’s IAP system and then dived into using Codeless IAP to easily add a purchasable item to your game. We then created the functionality to restore our purchase if we uninstall and reinstall our game and went over where we can go to set up our purchases depending on the store we want to target. These new skills give you the ability to make additional revenue from your game while also allowing you to target multiple stores and platforms, making it possible for even more people to see it.</p>
			<p>Now, of course, having all these ways to make money isn’t going to help us if no one plays our game. In the next chapter, we will get social, learning how we can make use of social media to share our score and get other players interested in our title.</p>
