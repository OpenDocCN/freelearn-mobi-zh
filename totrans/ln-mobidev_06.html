                    <h1 class="header-title">MVP is Always More Minimal Than You Think</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The M in MVP stands for Minimum, not Maximum. If your idea of MVP incorporates every potential use case, every potential mix of audience, all facets of available functionality, and creates a backlog that would take a development team longer than 90 days to complete, you don't have <strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong>. On the contrary, you have a different beast altogether that all too many times bring teams to their knees causing unnecessary rework, lost cycles, lost revenue, and all the other dysfunctional misery that comes with working on a product that isn't well defined and validated with its users.</p>
<p>In written context, the idea of defining MVP seems simple; the challenges surface when teams try to outline and define what minimal means in terms of their initial product release. "How Minimal is Minimal?", "Can I have multiple core functions?", "Are all my use cases covered and accounted for?", and "Can I have more than 12 buttons on a screen?" All these and many other questions make it difficult to know whether our proposed MVP is truly minimal and viable.</p>
<p>This guide is designed to act as a benchmarking tool, and will help ensure that you have successfully defined and validated an MVP that's ready for market release.</p>
<p>We're going to cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is MVP?</li>
<li>How to define your MVP</li>
<li>Fail fast/validate everything</li>
<li>Iterate and evolve your MVP - from viable to lovable</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What is MVP?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A <strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong> (<strong>MVP</strong>) is defined as:</p>
<p>"The version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort"<br/>
- Eric Ries</p>
<p>Applications such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Tinder all share the same thing in common: when they were launched, they were a much more simplified version of what they are today. The same can be said about smartphones and iPods. At the time of their inception, they did one thing and did it well. Clearly, these products have matured and after years of capital investment and development, have become apps that deliver way beyond their core functionality. What's important to note is that they are great examples of products that were released to market with a minimal feature set, targeted at solving a core problem for an initial segment of users.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Benefits of MVP</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Embracing a Lean MVP product design and development model within your organization helps keep costs at a minimum and allows you to test and validate your ideas much faster:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep it simple</strong>: Focusing on core functionality that delivers immediate value/utility allows you to get your product into the market faster, rather than committing to endless cycles of development that are needed to deliver a full-blown multifeature product.</li>
<li><strong>Save money</strong>: Reveal the market validity of your product and justify a case for further investment and development. Have a working prototype that allows you to pivot or persevere with minimal costs or efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Learn and evolve</strong>: The iterative and evolutionary nature of the MVP model is meant to be fast and nimble. It allows you to mature and refine your product over time in short sprints, while simultaneously surfacing invaluable user feedback and insights that help inform and shape your future iterations.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to define your MVP</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There is a lot of controversy surrounding how to define an MVP, as it relates to answering the question of "How minimal is minimal?" It's a very subjective concept, and every product has its own set of nuances and requirements that make it a little different. It's not an all-or-nothing proposition, but there are techniques and best practices that can be applied to help you define your offering as a MVP. The market demands may require more than one core piece of functionality to define MVP.</p>
<p>In this section, we will discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to build an MVP</li>
<li>Bringing components together to form an MVP</li>
<li>Applying MVP to enterprise</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Building MVP</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the following first illustration, it's clear that the intended MVP was to build a vehicle that would allow its users to commute from point A to point B, not necessarily how fast, how far, or committing to a motorized vehicle versus self-powered, and so on:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="126" src="img/af83b65a-6da4-4c47-9d33-a8f616b745af.png" width="407"/></div>
<p>Clearly, in the second illustration, multiple use-cases and conditions were considered, and as a result this model won't allow for quick market validation and runs the risk of increasing costs and potentially missing the mark with its audience:</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="119" src="img/b6a0a699-50b3-42e9-99fb-fa3ca0a1d1f1.png" width="382"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Bringing components together to form an MVP</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the first illustration, they brought together several components to create a skateboard. They needed a board, some wheels, and the truck mounts to connect the wheels to the board. All these things together made up the MVP for a commuter vehicle. Apply this metaphor and thought process to the MVP that you are defining. For example, if your MVP is a CRM software, at the most basic level, it will need to provide a central place where users can store customer and prospect contact information, share it with colleagues, and track sales progress. Multiple components or features will be combined in order to define the MVP. Bringing together the functionality for managing customers and the reporting functionality to track sales leads is what defines the MVP for our example CRM. Both of these components are mini MVPs in and of themselves, and as standalone components don't define the MVP for a competitive CRM in the market. Don't forget, the <strong>V</strong> stands for <strong>Viable</strong>, and that means having just enough features to start selling.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Applying MVP to enterprise</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The traditional enterprise approach to software development is focused around delivering the perfect, full-blown and feature-rich product before it is released to customers. Neither of this is minimal or viable, as it relates to MVP guidelines and best practices. Enterprise teams struggle to define minimal (just the right amount of features that add value and utility) and balance it against viable (do I have enough features in my product that people are willing to pay for?).</p>
<p>There are different methods that can be applied to enterprise products that help redefine MVP in that space:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data-driven design</strong>: Place data at the center of product decisions. It's easier than ever to use the voice of customers, usage metrics, and existing performance reports to create a hierarchy of features that can be prioritized and paired down to minimum and viable.</li>
<li><strong>Know your market</strong>: You can't build everything for everyone. Make sure you have a clear target market segment and start there, even if that means your customer is an enterprise player. Clearly defining who it is you are building your product for will help you define a barrier of entry into market and solidify your MVP.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Sellable Product (MSP)</strong>: Once you've defined your MVP, don't forget to make sure it's viable. Test it with your target market to ensure that it has the minimal amount of features that your users would be willing to pay for. And avoid the common mistake of relying solely on the product manager's intuition and internal assumptions to predict which features drive products. Validate!</li>
<li><strong>Apply incremental UX</strong>: Bring the concept of MVP down to the component or feature level, it's not an all-or-nothing proposition anymore. The basic idea is to have a planned progression (leaving room for improvements through testing) of a feature that adds functionality at each stage. This will allow you to get to the market faster (viability) and mature your product over time through validated learning that saves time and costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>But don't think that everyone will understand this process immediately, especially in an enterprise where your colleagues and teams are spread out across the world. It requires relentless evangelism. In our company, <em>Dominion Dealer Solutions</em>, we have offices around the US supported by offshore teams in three different countries. To make things more challenging, many of the teams were former acquisitions that came with their own inherited cultures and biases. Getting everyone to understand and embrace the concept of developing MVPs took a lot of evangelizing by key people to develop buy-in. This took many months, but once the idea took hold, it spread like wildfire.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Fail fast – validate everything</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The core fundamentals of MVP are to get user feedback, do user testing, and validate whether users are willing to use (and pay for) the product you are launching both before and throughout the entire product life cycle. Unfortunately, some teams get caught up with minimum/viable, and forget about validation altogether. Validated learning is the critical component that defines MVP, confirms market demand, and shapes future iterations and investment of time, revenue, and resources into your product. It is the best indicator of whether or not you should pivot and abandon a project before losing too much money and burning out resources, or persevere and keep forging ahead in the market. MVP is governed by a "fail fast and recover quickly" continuous validation model that ensures that teams remain hyperefficient in regards to time, resources, and operational capital.</p>
<p>Let's look at the three things that help us do a good job at failing fast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply agile prototyping - eliminate tech debt</li>
<li>Adopt Lean UX cycles - the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop</li>
<li>Testing methods and best practices</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Apply agile prototyping - eliminate tech debt</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Prototypes allow you to explore design ideas, test assumptions, and gather feedback from users while minimizing technical debt. For the ones who might not know, technical debt refers to future work that builds up over time when a team codes quickly to get a product or prototype to market, rather than code well to create the best possible solution.</p>
<p>In many cases, given today's technology, you can create high-def prototypes that require no technical debt at all. Any time savings that might be potentially gained by bypassing prototyping is lost many times over in development if your MVP interfaces and functions need to be redesigned and recreated after they have been committed to code.</p>
<p>Here are some of the advantages and benefits that are gained if you apply agile prototyping to your product design and development process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ownership and collaboration</strong>: Increase team consensus and ownership; discover potential usability issues and correct them in prototype before programming a line of code and potentially assuming tech debt.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow efficiency</strong>: Reduce and eliminate the need for extensive story writing and requirement documentation. It's much different when everyone can click and engage over an actual experience versus imagining and interpreting user interactions using wireframes or mockups.</li>
<li><strong>Validate often</strong>: Gather real-time feedback from users and rapidly evolve your MVP quickly, sprint by sprint.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Lean UX cycles – the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A core component of Lean UX is the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. The concept is originally derived from the book entitled "<em>The Lean Startup</em>", by Eric Ries. Its goal is to validate uncertainties, assumptions, and potential risks in order to guide future MVP iterations and product direction. The loop forms a cycle, and the cycle is applied to a sprint in agile development. This approach provides a methodology that quickly and effectively proves whether a product vision (MVP) will flounder or flourish:</p>
<div><img height="331" src="img/63f361b2-e4ec-4e7e-bd9b-a36849a43f0a.png" width="378"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Advantages of a feedback-focused development model</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Adopting a data-driven, feedback-focused development model allows organizations to manage development costs and resources much more efficiently. Development time and labor can immediately be reduced by creating a hi-fi prototype that can be used in validation cycles to inform the design process. It's a feast or famine digital marketplace out there—invalidated business assumptions are too risky and costly to produce in today's digital marketplace.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Phases of the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are three phases to this loop: Build, Measure, and Learn.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Phase I - Build</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The first step is figuring out the problem that needs to be solved and then defining and developing an MVP to begin the process of learning as quickly as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideate</strong>: Develop your idea or concept. Identify what the problem that needs solving is in very clear terms.</li>
<li><strong>Create your prototype</strong>: Think simple and small. It's best to build the smallest possible increment that quickly brings back enough validation to inform next steps.</li>
<li><strong>Define an experiment/test study to prove your hypothesis</strong>: Create question sets, consider A/B tests, and task analysis.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Phase II - Measure</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The next step is to gather as much validated learning as you can in an interactive cycle, and shape the patterns and insights derived from your testing to drive future investments and iterations of your MVP:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initiate your test study</strong>: Conduct interviews, distribute questionnaires, and validate your prototype.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze</strong>: Take a look at your data objectively. What surfaced? Are there any common patterns and behaviors?</li>
<li><strong>Organize</strong>: Cluster patterns and behaviors that overlap together start shaping and surfacing insights.</li>
<li><strong>Compile</strong>: Take your insights and translate them into actionable items and talking points that will help inform potential revisions, future iterations, and releases.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Phase III - Learn</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is where a decision will need to be made regarding whether to persevere or pivot with your MVP. Persevere, in this context, means forging ahead with the same goals, while pivot requires at the very least altering, and even potentially completely resetting your original MVP vision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish whether your MVP actually solves a problem for its users. Does my MVP meet the needs of my intended target user?</li>
<li>Establish your MVP viability. Does my MVP provide a feature set that my users are willing to pay for?</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">10 essential UX testing methods</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Validation is the cornerstone of MVP product development. It's the fuel that powers the MVP Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. There are a number of different testing methods that can be used to help define MVP and continuously improve UX iteratively by applying Build-Measure-Learn cycles.</p>
<p>The following are 10 essential UX testing methods that can be used to help validate your MVP:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Survey</strong>: The most cost-effective way to find out who your users are, what they want, what they do, what they purchase, where they shop, and what they own is to survey them. You can find survey software that is free, so there's no excuse.</li>
<li><strong>Persona/market segmentation</strong>: Use the survey data and identify meaningful patterns and behaviors among your user groups. Surface what functions certain segments demand as well as the pain points they experience. Find your MVP market sweet spot within your market segment.</li>
<li><strong>Contextual inquiry</strong>: Sometimes it's difficult for users to communicate exactly what they want or what they are trying to achieve. It's always ideal to observe users in their environment performing the tasks and functions that are critical to their role. You can probe and survey them while they are performing their tasks to discover what works and what needs improving.</li>
<li><strong>SME/stakeholder interviews</strong>: There's a lot of information that can be tapped internally within your own organization. Interview any SMEs, customer support, QA, development, marketing, or sales personnel to find out what needs to be built, for whom, and why.</li>
<li><strong>Task analysis</strong>: Measure discoverability, usability, and performance by observing users engaged in specific tasks and workflows.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Moderated in-person testing</strong>: This is ideal for mobile device testing, or when it's tough to put prototypes up remotely, test users in a lab, conference room, or even a coffee shop to gather invaluable feedback and insight.</li>
<li><strong>Moderated remote testing</strong>: This is the cheapest form of user testing available. Using services such as Zoom meetings, Google Forms, and InVision allow you to record and moderate user tests anywhere on the internet. Helps expands your recruitment base, and doesn't limit user pools.</li>
<li><strong>A/B testing</strong>: This can be used in many conditions, remote, moderated, and so on. Comparatively test layouts, interface controls, buttons, CTAs, colors, tasks, performance... the sky's the limit.</li>
<li><strong>Comparative benchmark study</strong>: Comparatively test the same tasks on competitive applications. Use core metrics such as completion rates, time and task difficulty as a basis for creating benchmarks. For example, is the checkout process at Zappos faster, more efficient, and easier to use than the checkout process at Amazon?</li>
<li><strong>Multivariate testing</strong>: One-variable-at-a-time testing can take a long time, and you will quickly burn through your testers a lot faster than expected. If you need to test often, performing multivariate tests will allow you to not only maximize the returns you get from your testing pool, but also give you a great idea of how your experience works as a whole. For instance, changing the color of a button will glean some data, but nothing compares to the data you mine when you change the location, color, and label of the button and test all the variants together. You can do multivariate tests on both live and prototype environments. Products such as Optimizely helps you organize and launch multivariate tests in live environments with real users.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Iterate and evolve - from viable to lovable</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Now that we have successfully launched our initial MVP into the market, and gathered some validated learning, what's next? How does it scale? Is it just more of the same? No, absolutely not. This whole process is all about evolving and maturing your product, your users, and your revenue. The goal has become about taking your product from viable to lovable, introducing <strong>Minimum Loveable Product</strong> (<strong>MLP</strong>).</p>
<p>MLP is defined as the version of the product that brings back the maximum amount of love from its users with the least amount of effort. We all recognize products in our lives that we love and can't live without: cars, smartphones created by remarkable brands such as Apple, Audi, Samsung, and G-Star. We love these products because they evoke a positive emotional connection within us. In simple terms, they make us smile.</p>
<p>There are many different ways of making a positive emotional connection with your users, but the easiest is through good design.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Five tips to go from viable to lovable</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Here are some great insights to help guide your product down a "Loveable" user experience path:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on value</strong>: Most often, teams are laser-focused on what they are building, not why. Users aren't motivated to buy the what (lawnmower); they buy the why (I need to cut my grass). Build stuff that matters.</li>
<li><strong>Do one thing really well</strong>: One solid function or feature is much better than three mediocre ones. Learn from success stories such as Dropbox and Instagram. They created masses of followers that love their products by simply focusing on doing one thing really well.</li>
<li><strong>Validate and iterate often</strong>: Working on moving targets with no end in sight equals lost vision, lost opportunity, lost motivation, and lost revenue. Validate your designs against short cycles. Timebox your MVP to 90-day increments (12-week cycles). 90 days is enough time to deliver on your vision, but not long enough to lose sight of it.</li>
<li><strong>Make the user first</strong>: Zoom in on problems that are real pain points for your customer. Have you validated these pain points, or are they your opinion? Remember, user-centered product design is an exercise in other-centeredness. It's about your audience's response to your products, not yours.</li>
<li><strong>Talk the talk, walk the walk</strong>: Commit to the objective and stay disciplined to the process. If design is important to you, demonstrate it through your actions: bring design in early to collaborate on MVP strategy/vision—start wireframes and protos early. Don't just say that your customer is important to you, show it through your actions: test and validate your MVP ideas.</li>
</ul>

Lastly, we discussed evolving your MVP from viable to lovable, and how to evoke an emotional response from your users. Use these building blocks to save time and money, and begin building products that you know your users will love and need.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will review case studies that illustrate many of the ideas discussed here.</p>
