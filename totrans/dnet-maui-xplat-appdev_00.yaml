- en: .NET MAUI is a cross-platform technology developed by Microsoft. The inaugural
    edition of this book was authored using .NET 6\. However, this second edition
    coincides with the diverse improvements initiated with the release of .NET 8\.
    The latest .NET MAUI release predominantly seeks to enhance code quality. Simultaneously,
    updates have been made to the development environment that supports iOS and Android,
    upgrading to Xcode 15 and Android API 34 respectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The improvements targeted are concentrated on a range of vital aspects, such
    as rectifying memory leaks, refining UI controls, instituting platform-specific
    fixes, and optimizing performance. The goal of these enhancements is to fortify
    memory management, escalate application stability, and polish the consistency
    of user experiences across varying platforms, thereby augmenting the overall application
    performance and responsiveness. With a focus on these components, I strive to
    provide you with an exhaustive understanding of the latest advancements in .NET
    MAUI technology.

    including Flutter and React Native, .NET MAUI stands out due to its unique features

    individually for each platform. However, .NET MAUI has improved this aspect by
    enabling the sharing of the majority of resources across platforms, including
    fonts, images, icons, etc.'

    must rely on Flutter plugins or React Native Modules, which in turn rely on the
    developer community or require personal development. Furthermore, these interfaces
    are developer-designed and thus lack standardization. Thankfully, Microsoft has
    standardized APIs for most often used native device features as part of .NET MAUI’s
    release.

    UI or a Blazor-based UI in Blazor Hybrid apps, furthering opportunities for advanced
    code reuse. This advantage is particularly valuable for projects encompassing
    web and mobile apps, as it allows the sharing of user interface design and source
    code.
