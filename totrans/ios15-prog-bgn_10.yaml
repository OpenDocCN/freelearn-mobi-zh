- en: Welcome to *Part 2* of this book. At this point, you're familiar with the Xcode
    user interface, and you have a solid foundation of using Swift. In this part,
    you'll start creating the user interface of a restaurant reservation app, named
    *Let's Eat*. You will use Interface Builder to build the screens that your app
    will use, add elements such as buttons, labels, and fields to them, and connect
    them together, using segues. As you will see, you can do this with a minimum amount
    of coding.
