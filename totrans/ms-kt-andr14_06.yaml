- en: Building upon the foundational knowledge gained in *Part 1*, this part propels
    you into advanced concepts, providing a deeper understanding of Android development.
    Delving into diverse architectures, the focus shifts toward mastering the MVVM
    architecture for your applications. Furthermore, you will unravel the intricacies
    of making network calls by incorporating the Retrofit networking library. Taking
    it a step further, you will harness the power of Kotlin coroutines to seamlessly
    execute asynchronous network requests. Your navigational prowess will be honed
    using the Jetpack Navigation library, exploring techniques for efficient navigation
    on large screens and foldable devices. The journey continues with insights into
    handling long-running tasks in the background and leveraging Room for local data
    storage. Wrapping up, we will demystify runtime permissions, and you will comprehend
    their significance and master the art of requesting permissions dynamically within
    your app.
