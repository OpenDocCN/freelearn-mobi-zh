- en: There has never been a better time to be a game developer. The App Store provides
    a unique opportunity to distribute your ideas to a massive audience. Now, Swift
    has arrived to bolster our toolkit and provide a smoother development experience.
    Swift is new, but is already hailed as an excellent, well-designed language. Whether
    you are new to game development or looking to add to your expertise, I think you
    will enjoy making games with Swift.

- en: My goal in writing this book is to share a fundamental knowledge of Swift and
    SpriteKit. We will work through a complete example game so that you learn every
    step of the Swift development process. Once you finish this text, you will be
    comfortable designing and publishing your own game ideas to the App Store, from
    start to finish.
