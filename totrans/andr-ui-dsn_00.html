Even if your app delivers great functionality, if its user interface is clunky, laggy, difficult to navigate, or just an all-around eyesore, then no one is going to want to use it.</p><p>Android isn't the easiest platform to design for. Creating an app that looks great across countless different devices, all with different combinations of hardware, software, and screens, is no mean feat. But if you put some thought into the design process, you can create a UI that delivers a great experience across the <span class="emphasis"><em>entire </em></span>Android ecosystem.</p><p>This book will help you become a design-minded developer. Over the course of 10 chapters, you'll learn how to design, refine, test, and develop an effective, engaging UI that people will <span class="emphasis"><em>love</em></span> using and that delivers the best possible experience regardless of device specifics.</p><p>From the fundamentals of layouts and views right through to creating responsive, multi-pane layouts, and from sketching your screens, through to using Android Studio's tools to scrutinise your view hierarchy and hunt out memory leaks, this book covers everything you need to create the perfect Android UI.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec2"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
