The release of the iPhone 4, back in 2010, took the world by storm. Developers around the world have been embracing the new features, such as incorporating AirPlay features within their applications, making use of the retina display to provide crisp and high-definition graphics within their applications and games, as well as the accelerometer and gyroscope.<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>When Apple hosted their annual World Wide Developer Conference in June 2011, they introduced more than 200 new features, as well as an updated SDK that features over 1,500 new development APIs. This opened up a lot of ideas for many new applications and the way we do things currently, to be done differently. Some of the great new feature highlights are the ability to support the way in which notification messages are handled by using the new<strong> Notification Center</strong>, messaging has been greatly improved by using the new<strong> iMessage</strong> messaging application, and finally, the ability to organize and purchase all of your newspaper and magazine subscriptions using the new<strong> Newsstand</strong> application.<a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>In this chapter, you will gain an insight into some of the fantastic new features and enhancements that have been incorporated into the latest iOS 5 release. We will also look at how to go about downloading and installing the Xcode developer tools and<strong> Software Development Kit</strong> (<strong>SDK</strong>).<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>In this chapter, we will:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Get introduced to some of the new features that come with iOS 5</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Download and install the Xcode development tools</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Create a simple application using the features of the Newsstand framework</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Create a simple application that sends an e-mail, using the<code class="literal"> MessageUI</code> framework</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Remove the Xcode development tools</li></ul></div><p>We have a exciting journey ahead of us, so let's get started.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec01"/>What's new in iOS 5</h1></div></div></div><p>Since the release of Apples iOS operating system back in June 2007, they have incorporated many new features and improvements within each release build of its operating system. In iOS 4, we saw this came with over 1,500 new APIs, as well as some high quality enhancements and improvements.<a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>In iOS 5, Apple has introduced over 200 new features and improvements, as well as 1,500 new APIs and updates to its SDK, to include new features relating to Core Image, Twitter integration, and the Newsstand Kit.</p><p>Needless to say, the Xcode 4 development environment has also undergone some improvements to allow your applications to be compiled with the new LLVM compiler 3.0 that supports<strong> Automatic Reference Counting</strong> (<strong>ARC</strong>). Hence, you rarely need to retain or release your objects, as ARC does most of the work for you. In some cases, you will still need to use retain/release. Storyboard support has also been integrated into Interface Builder, which allows you to design multiple-view workflows for each of your views.<a id="id4" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Lastly, debugging OpenGL ES projects are a lot easier, as these have been integrated into the Xcode debugging interface.</p><p>In the following sections, we will focus in detail on some of the new features that come with iOS 5.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec01"/>Reminders</h2></div></div></div><p>A neat new feature that comes as part of this release is the<strong> Reminders App</strong>. A good way to think of reminders would be to think of them as to-do lists. Reminders can prove to be a life-saver, as they give you the flexibility to organize your day-to-day tasks, and come complete with the ability to add due dates and locations.<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>When you set up your reminders to use locations, you can specify to be reminded on a specific day or location, as well as being reminded either when you arrive or leave the location. They make use of your mobile phone's GPS, similar to how your car's navigation system works, and are designed to alert you as soon as you approach the designated area. Let's take an example, say for instance, you wanted to buy a new printer and some additional ink, you set up your reminder to automatically send you an alert as soon as you pulled into your local stores, parking lot.</p><p>Finally, another thing to mention about reminders: since these have been integrated into iOS 5, they have been designed to work well with other applications. For example, Apple iCal, Microsoft Outlook, and iCloud. This has been done to ensure that any changes you make will automatically update on all of your devices and calendars.</p><p>The following screenshots shows a list of items that have been added to a to-do list, and then shows how you can configure and specify when to be reminded. You can choose to be reminded when you leave or arrive at a particular location. The final screenshot shows the reminder pop-up when the specified time has been reached. Additional items can be added to the list by selecting the<strong> +</strong> plus sign, as highlighted by a rectangle.<a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_01.jpg" alt="Reminders"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec02"/>Notification Center</h2></div></div></div><p>Notifications play an important role in an iPhone user's everyday life. Notifications come in the form of pop-ups to inform you that a new e-mail has arrived, of new SMS text messages, of friend requests from social networking sites, notifications when your phone credit falls below a certain amount, and much more. With the Notification Center application, you don't need to worry about locating that e-mail, SMS text message, or friend request. It has been made simple enough for you to keep track of all of these forms of notifications in one convenient location.<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The Notification Center can be accessed by simply placing your finger anywhere at the top of the screen and swiping in a downward motion. There are many different notifications to choose from when you are in this view. For instance, you can choose to see the current weather forecast, your stock shares, calendar entries of upcoming appointments, and so on. As new notifications come through, they will be added and will appear at the top of the list for easier access, without interrupting what you're doing.</p><p>You can also act upon Notifications through the<strong> lock</strong> screen on your iOS device; these appear categorized within a table view, so that you can act on them quickly by simply sliding the panel to unlock and take you to the relevant application. For example, if you receive a message, this will open up the<strong> iMessage</strong> application. As you can see, the Notification Center provides you with a much better way of staying on top of your life's activities.<a id="id8" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_02.jpg" alt="Notification Center"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec03"/>Newsstand</h2></div></div></div><p>The<strong> Newsstand</strong> is a central place, where iOS users can access their subscribed magazines and newspapers. Unlike iBooks, where book publishers supply<code class="literal"> .epub</code> files or similar documents, Newsstand publishers will have to create an iOS application (or adapt their existing application). Think of it like a cross between the shelf seen in the iBooks application and applications folders on the home screen.<a id="id9" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>To make use of the new features, publishers must invoke the newly added<strong> Newsstand Kit framework</strong>. There are some simple settings that need to be configured to allow your application to recognize that it is a magazine or a newspaper, so that it can be placed within the Newsstand application, instead of running as a standalone application.<a id="id10" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>In the coming section, we will proceed to download and install the iOS 5 SDK. If you have already installed this, you can skip this section altogether and proceed to the next section.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec02"/>Getting and installing the iOS 5 SDK</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we can start to build our iOS applications, you must first sign up as a registered iOS Developer at<a class="ulink" href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/"> http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/</a>. The registration process is free and provides you with access to the iOS SDK and other developer resources that are really useful for getting you started.<a id="id11" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Once you have signed up, you can then download the iOS SDK, as shown in the following screenshot. It may be worthwhile making sure that your machine satisfies the following system requirements prior to your downloading the iOS SDK:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Only Intel Macs are supported, so if you have another processor type (such as the older G4 or G5 Macs), you're out of luck</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You have updated your system with the latest Mac OS X software updates for either OS X Lion or Snow Leopard</li></ul></div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>If you want to develop applications for the iPad and iPod Touch, you can still use the iOS SDK, as they use the same<strong> operating system</strong> (OS) as the iPhone does. This SDK allows you to create universal applications that will work with both the iPhone and iPad running on iOS 4 and above.</p></div><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_03.jpg" alt="Getting and installing the iOS 5 SDK"/></div><p>Once you have downloaded the SDK, you can proceed with installing it. You will be required to accept a few licensing agreements. You will then be presented with a screen to specify the destination folder in which to install the SDK:<a id="id12" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_04.jpg" alt="Getting and installing the iOS 5 SDK"/></div><p>If you select the default settings during the installation phase, the various tools (explained in detail later) will be installed in the <code class="literal">/Developer/Applications</code> folder.<a id="id13" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The installation process takes you through the custom installation option screens. You probably would have seen similar screens to this if you have installed other Mac software. The following screenshot shows what you will see here:</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_05.jpg" alt="Getting and installing the iOS 5 SDK"/></div><p>These options give you a little more control over the installation process. For example, you are able to specify the folder location to install Xcode, as well as settings for a variety of other options.<a id="id14" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The iOS 5 SDK comes as part of the Xcode Developer Tools download, which you'll find at<a class="ulink" href="http://https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action"> https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action</a>.</p><p>The SDK consists of the following components:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Xcode:</strong> This is the main<strong> Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>) that enables you to manage, edit, and debug your projects<a id="id15" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Dashcode:</strong> This enables you to develop web-based iOS applications and Dashboard widgets</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>iOS Simulator:</strong> This is a Cocoa-based application that provides a software simulator to simulate an iOS device on your Mac OS X<a id="id16" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Instruments:</strong> These are the analysis tools that help you optimize your applications and monitor for memory leaks in real-time<a id="id17" class="indexterm"/></li></ul></div><p>The following screenshot displays a list of the various tools that are installed as part of the default settings, during the installation phase. These are installed in the<code class="literal"> /Developer/Applications</code> folder:</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_06.jpg" alt="Getting and installing the iOS 5 SDK"/></div><p>In the next section, we will look at how we can use the power of the Newsstand Kit framework to enable developers to develop an application that will add items to our Newsstand, rather than this being launched as a separate iOS application.<a id="id18" class="indexterm"/>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec03"/>Creating the MyMagazineArticle application</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we can proceed with creating our<code class="literal"> MyMagazineArticle</code> application, we must first launch the Xcode4.2 development environment. Double-click on the Xcode icon located in the<code class="literal"> /Developer/Applications</code> folder.<a id="id19" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can use Spotlight to search for this: simply type<code class="literal"> Xcode</code> into the search box and Xcode should be displayed in the list at the top. When Xcode is launched, you should see the<strong> Welcome to Xcode</strong> screen, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><p>It may be worth docking the Xcode icon to your Mac OS X launch bar for easy access, as we will be using it a lot throughout this book.<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_07.jpg" alt="Creating the MyMagazineArticle application"/></div><p>It is very simple to create the MyMagazineArticle application in Xcode. Just follow the steps listed here:<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/>

There is also the ability to search for the framework, if you can't find it in the list shown.</li><li class="listitem"> If you are still confused on how to go about adding the<code class="literal"> NewsstandKit.framework</code>, you can refer to the following screenshot, which highlights what parts you need to select (highlighted by a rectangle).<a id="id26" class="indexterm"/></li></ol></div><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_11.jpg" alt="Adding the Newsstand Kit framework to our project"/></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>Adding properties to our application</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that we have added the<code class="literal"> NewsstandKit.framework</code> to our project, our next step is to start adding some properties to make our application show up within the Newsstand application.<a id="id27" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Unlike other iOS applications, Newsstand applications that you create will only appear in the Newsstand application, and not displayed within the user's home screen like iOS applications currently do. Instead of displaying the application icon, the application will display a cover and some additional information provided by Newsstand. When a user taps the cover of your application, it will automatically launch your application and present them with information pertaining to that article.</p><p>Creating an application that uses the Newsstand Kit requires communication between your application and the servers that host your content. Your servers are responsible for notifying the application when any new updates or releases are available, typically using a<strong> push</strong> notification.<a id="id28" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"/>Note</h3><p>For more information on push notifications, refer to the Apple Developer Connection documentation which can be found at the following address:<a class="ulink" href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Introduction/Introduction.html"> http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Introduction/Introduction.html</a>.</p></div><p>In order to make our application act like a Newsstand application, and make it appear on the shelf, three steps are required. These are:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"> Add the Newsstand Kit framework to your project.</li><li class="listitem"> Include the<strong> UINewsstandApp</strong> key within your<strong> MyMagazineArticle-Info.plist</strong> file to indicate that it supports Newsstand.

</p><p>The download process is self-managed, and is taken care of by the system, which then notifies your application when the content has been fully downloaded and made available.</p><p>In order to make our application appear within the newsstand folder, you will need to create an array entry<strong> CFBundleIconFiles</strong> under the<strong> CFBundlePrimaryIcons</strong> to include your standard application icon.</p><p>You then need to create your<strong> UINewsstandIcon</strong> with a<strong> CFBundle</strong> in there as well, as this is where you set your newspaper or magazine covers and specify the binding type, which gives your application an icon shape and its binding edge.</p><p>In the following screenshot, it shows how we can customize our application to have it show as a newspaper, by changing the<strong> UINewsstandBindingType</strong> property to<strong> UINewsstandBindingTypeNewspaper:</strong>
</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_14.jpg" alt="Adding properties to our application"/></div><p>Once you have created these entries within your application's<code class="literal"> .plist</code> file, by making sure that you have added the actual icon<code class="literal"> .png</code> files to your project, you will be ready to compile, build, and run your application.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec05"/>Building and running the MyEmailApp application</h1></div></div></div><p>Once you have implemented the previous code, it is time to compile, build, and run your application to see how it all works. The following screenshot below displays the<code class="literal"> MyEmailApp</code> application running within the iOS simulator, with all of the fields populated:<a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_21.jpg" alt="Building and running the MyEmailApp application"/></div><p>So, there you have it. You have successfully built an application using the<code class="literal"> MessageUI</code> framework that sends a new e-mail message. When you press the<strong> Send Email</strong> button, it displays the compose new e-mail view controller window directly within your application, with all fields pre-populated, and the navigation bar is colored appropriately. The action sheet that is shown in the last screenshot gets displayed when you press the<strong> Cancel</strong> button.<a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>iMessage</h2></div></div></div><p>
<strong>iMessage</strong> is an integrated add-on to the existing Messages application that we have come to know and love. iMessage allows you to easily send text messages, photos, videos, or other content to an individual or a group of people on other iOS devices running iOS 5 over Wi-Fi or 3G.<a id="id51" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>These messages are also automatically pushed to all of your other iOS devices, thus making it easier to maintain one conversation across all devices. When sending messages using iMessage, your phone automatically checks to see if the phone number of the person that you are sending is running iOS 5, if this is the case, it will send them an iMessage message rather than a standard SMS text.</p><p>Up to this point, your address book will be updated and a small blue chat bubble will appear next to the name of the contact to indicate that they can receive iMessages. If the person is not running iOS 5, then the address book will be updated with a green chat bubble. In the following screenshot, it displays the iMessages feature, and displays the conversations in small blue bubbles to indicate that both people are running iOS 5:<a id="id52" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_22.jpg" alt="iMessage"/></div><p>The bullet points below summarize some of the advantages of using iMessage, as opposed to the standard messaging component.<a id="id53" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iMessage brings the Message application for all iOS devices running iOS 5 the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.

It is worth mentioning that, while this feature doesn't incur any text messaging fees, it does use your bandwidth allocation, and depending on how much you use, it might cost you more.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iMessage easily allows you to find out if someone is responding to your message in the form of an ellipsis, as seen on applications such as an instant messenger.<a id="id55" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iMessage optionally allows you to track your messages with delivery receipt and read receipt.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You can send messages over Wi-Fi as well as over 3G.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Messages that are sent through iMessage are encrypted over the air.</li></ul></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>iPhone Camera</h2></div></div></div><p>Another component within the iPhone that has been updated in this latest release, is the<strong> iPhone Camera</strong>. Since the camera is the most widely used application to capture those special and unexpected moments, Apple has made this more accessible.<a id="id56" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>This application can now be accessed directly from your iPhone's lock screen, and features several improvements, such as:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Grid lines:</strong> These are very helpful for determining if the camera is leveled to ensure that you take a perfect shot every time, by using things in the horizon or edges of buildings.<a id="id57" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Pinch-to-zoom gestures:</strong> This feature enables you to manually zoom in and out, directly, within the camera application, rather than using the slider at the bottom of the screen.<a id="id58" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Single-tap focus:</strong> This feature allows you to lock the focus and the exposure to one area of the screen. Simply tap your finger anywhere on the screen.<a id="id59" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Exposure locks to compose a picture on the fly:</strong> This feature allows you to lock the focus and the exposure of your image, by simply placing and holding your finger on the screen.</li></ul></div><p>There have also been new photo editing improvements added to the<strong> Photos</strong> application, to enable you to manipulate your images, to either crop or rotate your image, or provide photo enhancements, such as removal of red-eye from your photos, all done directly within the Photos application</p><p>If you are using iCloud (we will be covering this in<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Using iCloud and the Storage APIs"> Chapter 2</a>,<em> Using iCloud and the Storage APIs)</em>, it is also possible to automatically load new photos onto your computer's desktop, should you prefer to edit them there using your preferred photo-editing tool.<a id="id60" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_23.jpg" alt="iPhone Camera"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>PC Free</h2></div></div></div><p>With the new<strong> PC Free</strong> feature that comes with iOS 5, users can set up and activate their devices without the need of a computer. Any new iOS software updates are deployed directly to your iOS devices, as well as any purchases made on your device from iTunes or the App Store. These are transferred securely over Wi-Fi using<strong> Secure Sockets Layer</strong> (<strong>SSL</strong>) back to your iTunes library.<a id="id61" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Once you have properly set up and configured iCloud, your backups and restores will automatically be done for you, and stored within the Cloud, making it easier for you to deploy any iOS updates to each of your iOS devices or computers that use the same Apple ID.<a id="id62" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The following screenshot displays options on how to set up your phone, restore your device from and iCloud backup, or from your iTunes library. Once this is done, you will receive a final<strong> Thank You</strong> screen, where you can start using your iOS device.<a id="id63" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_24.jpg" alt="PC Free"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Wi-Fi sync</h2></div></div></div><p>In iOS 5, Apple has provided an easier way for its users to wirelessly synchronize all of your iOS devices over a shared Wi-Fi connection directly back to your Mac or PC, without the need of having it connected directly to your computer, as you would have done previously.<a id="id64" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>What happens is that, each time you decide to charge your iOS device, it will automatically search for any new purchases or items that have been added to your device and then automatically synchronize this back to your iTunes library.</p><p>In this manner, you will always have a back up copy of all of your movies, precious home videos, and photo albums in one place, which can be accessed anytime you want them.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>Multitasking gestures</h2></div></div></div><p>Unfortunately, these never made it in the iOS 4 release; they were only included in the iOS 4 SDK for developers, but ended-up working really well on the iPad. In iOS 5, this has been greatly improved and includes a number of added features to make accessing content a lot easier. The engineers at Apple have made it simpler, and a lot easier to navigate around in as little moves as possible. They have also added shortcut menus to help you get around even quicker on the iPad.<a id="id65" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>These are achieved by using four or five fingers, and swiping upwards to reveal the multitasking bar and using the pinch motion to return to the<strong> Home</strong> screen. There has even been support added relating to swiping left or right, to switch between your applications.<a id="id66" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/2267EXP_01_25.jpg" alt="Multitasking gestures"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"/>Removing the Xcode developer tools</h2></div></div></div><p>Should you ever wish to uninstall Xcode (in the event that something went wrong during installation, or you just want to uninstall the Xcode developer tools), it is a very straightforward process. Open an instance of the terminal window and run the<code class="literal"> uninstall-devtools</code> script:<a id="id67" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><pre class="programlisting">sudo &lt;Xcode&gt;/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all
</pre></div><p>
<code class="literal">&lt;Xcode&gt;</code> is the directory where the tools are installed. For typical installations, the full path is<code class="literal"> /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools</code>.</p><p>
<code class="literal">&lt;sudo&gt;</code> is a system admin command that will require you to enter in the administrator password before proceeding.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"/>Note</h3><p>Before you proceed, make sure this is what you really intend to do, as once it's gone, it's permanently deleted. In any event, you can always choose to reinstall the Xcode developer tools. It is worth checking that the<code class="literal"> /Developer/Library/Xcode/</code> folder has also been removed. If not, just move it to the trash.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec06"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we learned about the new features of iOS 5, and how to go about downloading and installing the iOS 5 SDK, as well as familiarizing ourselves with some of the Xcode development tools.</p><p>We then moved on, and looked at how to build a simple Newsstand application, using the Newsstand Kit framework, to show how we can add newspapers and magazines to the Newsstand application folder. Next, we looked at how we can use the<code class="literal"> MessageUI</code> framework to build a simple e-mail application, and learned how we can customize the navigation bar UI to set the background color.</p><p>To end the chapter, we looked at the steps involved on how to uninstall the Xcode developer tools, using the command line.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will learn what<strong> iCloud</strong> exactly is that we keep hearing so much about it, and we will focus on the storage APIs that comes as part of iCloud.
