- en: Cocos2d for iPhone is a robust but simple to use 2D game framework for iPhone.
    It is fast, flexible, free, and App Store approved. More than 2500 App Store games
    already use it, including many best-selling games. Do you want to take your Cocos2d
    game development skills to the next level and become more professional in Cocos2d
    game design?

    of topics. It starts by taking a look at the basic uses of sprites. From there
    it provides examples for 2D and 3D primitive drawing, video playing, particle
    effects, ease actions, texture filled polygons, palette swapping, lighting, parallaxing,
    and more.'

    of uses of the Box2D physics engine. Examples include debug drawing, collision
    response, different shapes, dragging, physical properties, impulses, forces, asynchronous
    body destruction, joints, vehicles, character movement, bullets, ropes, and finally
    creating a top-down isometric game engine.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Scenes and Menus"), *Scenes and Menus*, provides
    examples of user interface implementations. It starts with examples involving
    scene management then moves to typical UI elements like labels, menus, alert dialogs,
    and UIKit wrapping. From there it moves into more advanced techniques like draggable
    menu windows, scrolling menus, sliding menus, loading screens, and a minimap.'

    techniques for adding intelligent AI actors into your games. These include processing
    waypoints, firing projectiles at moving targets, line of sight, and flocking behavior
    using Boids. The pathfinding problem is tackled in four separate recipes: A* pathfinding
    in a grid, a Box2D world, a TMX tilemap, and a side-scroller. Finally, the chapter
    discusses adding Lua scripting support, dynamically loading scripts, and using
    Lua for dialogue trees.'
