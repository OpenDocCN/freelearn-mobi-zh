    menu resource, we created the menu using the `Menu.add()` method. Since we want
    to modify the menu items later as well as respond to the menu item events, we
    defined our own menu IDs and passed them to the `add()` method. The `onOptionsItemSelected()` object
    is called for all the menu items, so we get the menu ID and use a `switch` statement
    based on the ID. We return `true` if we are handling the menu event, otherwise
    we pass the event to the super class.

    an external event, we created a button to toggle a Boolean flag. The visibility
    of the Download menu is determined by the flag. This is where you would want to
    create your custom code based on whatever criteria you set. Your flag could be
    set using the current player level or maybe when a new level is ready for release,

    *Layouts*, we discussed how many features from the old `ListView` were not already
    included in the new `RecyclerView`. Multiple item selection is one of the most
    missed features. In this recipe, we will demonstrate multiple item selection with
    the `RecyclerView` using Action Mode.

    most questions. As you can see from this example, even a basic implementation
    requires many steps but the end result can be the exact implementation required
    for your task. You won't be limited to an existing feature set since you'll be

    to trigger `ActionMode`. The `ActionMode` menu item calls the adapter when the
    user clicks the Delete All menu item and then closes the CAB.

    though is to efficiently handle many items when scrolling. If you add many more
    items to the list, enough to allow scrolling a screen or two, you''ll see the
    problem. `RecyclerView` does exactly what it says: it recycles the views. If you
    select the first item, then scroll down, you''ll see the problem - items you didn''t
    select are selected.'

    Because the view is being reused, it''s showing the state from the previous item.

    call. Add the following line of code to the `onBindViewHolder()` method in the
