			<p>Many people are perfectly happy with using their iPhone exactly the way it came out of the box. However, others like the idea of customizing their iPhone to make it more personal. For example, you might want to display a picture of your dog in the background or change the sound your iPhone makes every time you get a call so that it doesn't sound like everyone else's iPhone. </p>
			<p>Customizing your iPhone can be fun but also useful too. Beyond changing colors or pictures, you can also customize your iPhone to rearrange app icons to make it easier to find the apps you use most often. More importantly, you might want to modify the privacy settings to protect the security of your personal data. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, you'll learn different ways to customize your iPhone. Just remember that any time you change a setting, you can always change it back, so feel free to experiment and see how to make your iPhone uniquely your own. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will go through the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Getting an Apple ID</li>
				<li>Protecting your iPhone</li>
				<li>Making sure you don't lose your iPhone</li>
				<li>Changing the wallpaper</li>
				<li>Customizing sounds and haptics</li>
				<li>Blocking out disturbances</li>
				<li>Adjusting text size and screen brightness</li>
				<li>Customizing date/time formats</li>
				<li>Customizing the battery</li>
				<li>Defining an emergency SOS</li>
				<li>Protecting your privacy</li>
				<li>Defining notification settings</li>
				<li>Setting Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and hotspots</li>
				<li>Updating an iPhone</li>
				<li>Using accessibility features</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Since you'll likely want to download apps, listen to music, read e-books, or subscribe to news services, the first step when getting an iPhone is to set up an Apple ID.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Getting an Apple ID</h1>
			<p>To get the most out of <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>your iPhone, you should create an Apple ID, which is an account that lets you access Apple's various services, such as the App Store, the iTunes Store, and iCloud. While it's possible to use an iPhone without an Apple ID, you will not be able to buy apps or subscribe to services such as Apple Music or Apple News without an Apple ID. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you already have an Apple ID, you do not need to create another Apple ID account.</p>
			<p>Each user only needs one Apple ID. Since you cannot share Apple IDs, that means everyone in your family will need to create a separate Apple ID account. When you create an Apple ID, you'll need to define a unique password, along with several security questions that can help you access your Apple ID account in case you forget your password. To create an Apple ID, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Sign in to your iPhone</strong> button at the top of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.1</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.1 – Setting up an Apple ID&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Figure 3.1 – Setting up an Apple ID</p></li>
				<li>Tap<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> the <strong class="bold">Don't have an Apple ID or forgot it?</strong> link, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.2</em>: <div><img alt="Figure 3.2 – Creating an Apple ID&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Figure 3.2 – Creating an Apple ID</p><p>A dialog pops up listing <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>different options.</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Create Apple ID</strong> link, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.3</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.3 – The dialog for creating an Apple ID&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.03_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Figure 3.3 – The dialog for creating an Apple ID</p></li>
				<li>Follow the steps to define an Apple ID (which is the email address you want to use), along with a password and credit card billing information. Although Apple stores your credit card information, you will not be charged for anything until you actually make purchases through a service such as the App Store.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you have set up<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> an Apple ID, you'll now be able to make purchases through Apple's various services on your iPhone. To prevent unauthorized people from accessing your iPhone and making purchases on your stored credit card information, you should immediately take steps to protect your iPhone using a passcode and Touch ID or Face ID.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35">Protecting your iPhone<a id="_idTextAnchor124"/><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/></h1>
			<p>Since an iPhone can contain<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> important information and private messages and photographs, you don't want anyone to use your iPhone without your permission. To block access to your iPhone, you need to set up one or more of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Passcode</strong>: Requires<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> typing a six-digit number</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Touch ID</strong>: Requires your <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>fingerprint</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Face ID</strong>: Requires recognizing <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>your face</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember, not all iPhone models offer all three forms of access control. Some iPhones only offer passcodes and Touch ID, while others may only offer passcodes and Face ID. Whatever iPhone model you might have, use two forms of access control, such as a passcode and Face ID. Since every iPhone offers passcodes, make sure you set a good passcode as soon as possi<a id="_idTextAnchor126"/><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>ble.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Using passcodes</h2>
			<p>A passcode represents the first line of <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>defense restricting access to<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> your iPhone. Until someone types in the correct six-digit code, your passcode will block access to your iPhone. Ideally, you want your passcode to be easy for you to remember but hard for someone else to guess.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, numbers that are easy for you to remember can also be easy for someone else to guess. That's why passcodes that contain nothing but the same number, such as 33333, might be easy to remember but are also easy for someone to guess. </p>
			<p>Likewise, numbers that are hard for someone to guess can also be hard for you to remember. Ideally, choose a passcode that has some type of meaning to you that no one else will be able to guess or discover. For example, combining the year you were born with the month or day<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> you were born is not a good idea<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> because other people can easily discover those numbers by looking up your birthdate. Instead, choose numbers that other people cannot uncover, such as your first dog's birthdate (month and year) or some other number that has a unique meaning only to you. </p>
			<p>For extra security, you may want to change your passcode periodically. By changing your passcode periodically, you can ensure that even if someone does discover your passcode, your new passcode will lock them out again.</p>
			<p>To set up or change your passcode, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Face ID &amp; Passcode</strong> (for iPhones with Face ID) or <strong class="bold">Touch ID &amp; Passcode</strong> (for iPhones with Touch ID). A screen appears, asking for your six-digit passcode (if you have already defined one).</li>
				<li>Type in your six-digit passcode. A screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.4</em>, with different options, as follows:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Turn Passcode Off</strong>: This allows you to disable your passcode (not recommended).</li><li><strong class="bold">Change Passcode</strong>: This allows you to define a new six-digit passcode or a custom alphanumeric code.</li><li><strong class="bold">ALLOW ACCESS WHEN LOCKED</strong>: This allows you to turn on (or off) features that you may want to access without unlocking your iPhone, such as using Siri, viewing notifications, or replying to messages:</li></ul></li>
			</ol>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – Choosing passcode options</p>
			<p>Remember, passcodes<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> represent just the first line of protection. Once you've <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>defined a passcode, make sure you also set up Touch ID or Face ID on your iPhone as well to provide additional <a id="_idTextAnchor129"/><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>security.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Using Touch ID</h2>
			<p>Touch ID lets<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> you store up to<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> five fingerprints, so you can store fingerprints from one or both hands. Many people use their thumb or index finger, but you can choose any combination of other fingers that you find most convenient to use. </p>
			<p>The idea behind storing multiple fingerprints is to ensure that you will be able to access your iPhone with your fingerprint no matter which hand you may use or how you may be holding your iPhone. </p>
			<p>To set up Touch ID, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Touch ID &amp; Passcode</strong>. A screen <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>appears asking for your six-digit passcode.</li>
				<li>Type in your six-digit<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> passcode. A new screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">F<a id="_idTextAnchor132"/><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>igure 3.5</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.5 – Touch ID settings&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – Touch ID settings</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Add a Fingerprint…</strong> to recognize another fingerprint (you can swipe left on any fingerprint to either delete it or give it a more descriptive name than <strong class="bold">Finger 1</strong> and so on).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each time you<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> add a fingerprint, you'll need to roll your fingertip across the fingerprint sensor on the Home button until the iPhone recognizes the complete fingerprint. You may also want to define Touch ID to unlock your iPhone or use Apple Pay. </p>
			<p>After you've captured <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>your fingerprints in Touch ID, you'll be able to unlock your iPhone just by pressing a recognized fingertip on the Home button where the fingerprint sensor can recognize your fingerprint.</p>
			<p>While Touch ID is popular on older iPhone models, Face ID has become the newer method for authorizing access.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Using Face ID</h2>
			<p>Face ID relies on the iPhone's camera to<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> recognize your face, regardless of whether you wear glasses or contacts. The idea is to scan the front of<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> your face from slightly different angles to capture a three-dimensional image. Then, any time you want to unlock your iPhone, you can just point your camera at your face.</p>
			<p>To set up Face ID, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Face ID &amp; Passcode</strong>. A screen appears asking for your six-digit passcode.</li>
				<li>Type in your six-digit passcode. Another screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Set Up Face ID</strong>. The screen shows a circle where you need to position your face inside.</li>
				<li>Hold your iPhone an arm's length away in portrait mode (where the camera is oriented at the top of the iPhone).</li>
				<li>Roll your head to one side then the other until the camera captures your face from all angles by highlighting the entire circle around your face, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.6</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.6 – Training Face ID to recognize your face&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – Training Face ID to recognize your face</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Continue</strong> and repeat the scan to ensure that Face ID can recognize your face, and then tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've successfully captured your <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>face in Face ID, you'll be able to unlock your iPhone by simply pointing your camera at your face. Make sure you hold the <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>iPhone in portrait orientation with the camera at the top. An animated lock icon at the top of the screen will change from closed to open. When that happens, you can swipe up to access the Home screen of your iPhone.</p>
			<p>Using passcodes, Touch ID, or Face ID can keep someone from accessing your iPhone without your permission, but you also need to know where your iPhone is so that you don't lose it. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39">Making sure you don't<a id="_idTextAnchor135"/><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/> lose your iPhone</h1>
			<p>You can't use your<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> iPhone if you can't find it. So, after securing your iPhone with passcodes, Touch ID, or Face ID, set up tracking so that you can find your iPhone in case you misplace it (or in case someone steals it). </p>
			<p>The idea behind tracking a lost iPhone is that you can find it again. If for some reason you cannot retrieve your iPhone, then you can remotely wipe all the data so that a thief cannot access your personal data. </p>
			<p>Tracking your iPhone requires using iCloud, which requires an Apple ID. Once you turn on tracking, you'll be able to track your iPhone using any device that can access iCloud, such as a com<a id="_idTextAnchor137"/><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>puter or an iPad. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Setting up tracking</h2>
			<p>Since tracking requires<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> an Apple ID, by default, tracking is turned off. To turn tracking on, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the Apple ID at the top of the screen that displays your name, as shown<a id="_idTextAnchor140"/><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/> in <em class="italic">Figure 3.7</em>: <div><img alt="Figure 3.7 – The Apple ID button&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.07_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – T<a id="_idTextAnchor143"/><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>he Apple ID button</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Find My</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Find My</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Find My iPhone</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Find My iPhone</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.8</em>, which lets you turn on (or off) va<a id="_idTextAnchor146"/><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>rious settings:<div><img alt="Figure 3.8 – The Find My iPhone screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.08_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.8 – The Find My iPhone screen</p></li>
				<li>Turn on all the <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>settings to track your iPhone. You will now be able to track your iPhone through iCloud using any computer's browser.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Locating a missing iPhone</h2>
			<p>After you've turned on iPhone<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> tracking, you must set up an iCloud account by visiting <a href="http://iCloud.com">iCloud.com</a>. Once you've turned on iPhone tracking and set up an iCloud account, you'll be able to locate your iPhone through any browser by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Visit <a href="http://iCloud.com">iCloud.com</a> using any browser and type in your email address and password.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Find iPhone</strong> icon from the iCloud screen, as show<a id="_idTextAnchor149"/><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>n in <em class="italic">Figure 3.9</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.9 – Using Find My iPhone in iCloud&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9 – Using Find My iPhone in iCloud</p></li>
				<li>Type in your Apple ID <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>password. iCloud displays a map showing the location of your iPhone.</li>
				<li>Tap the circle that represents your iPhone's location. A menu appears, giving you the <strong class="bold">Play Sound</strong>, <strong class="bold">Lost Mode</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Erase iPhone</strong> options, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.10</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.10 – Options for tracking an iPhone&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.10_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.10 – Options for tracking an iPhone</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Play Sound</strong> makes your iPhone play a noise so that you can find it in your home. <strong class="bold">Lost Mode</strong> lets you lock your iPhone and display a phone number for someone to contact you so that you can recover your lost iPhone. <strong class="bold">Erase iPhone</strong> lets you wipe everything important from your iPhone so that nobody can retrieve that data.</p>
			<p>Once you've set up <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>tracking to find a lost iPhone, and you have set up a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to block unauthorized access, it's time to start customizing your iPhone for fun. One way to personalize your iPhone is to change its wallpaper, which is the image that appears in the background whenever the H<a id="_idTextAnchor153"/><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>ome screen appears.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42">Cha<a id="_idTextAnchor155"/><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>nging the wallpaper</h1>
			<p>Since you'll use the Home <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>screen often, you might as well display an image that you like, such as an image that inspires you, or your favorite pet or person. Apple <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>provides some wallpaper options, but you can always buy separate wallpaper images from other companies.</p>
			<p>However, chances are good that you've taken pictures of something or someone you like, so you can use any image stored in the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>library or any image you find on the internet.</p>
			<p>To change your wallpaper, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Wallpaper</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Wallpaper</strong> screen appears. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Choose a</strong> <strong class="bold">New Wallpaper</strong>. A new screen appears, listing the different wallpaper options you can choose from, such as choosing an image stored in your <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>library, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.11</em>:<p class="figure-caption"> </p><div><img alt="Figure 3.11 – Choosing a different image for the wallpaper&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.11_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.11 – Choosing a different image for the wallpaper</p></li>
				<li>Tap an image you want to<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> use. A preview of the image appears, letting you see how it looks on the iPhone screen. You may be able to move or zoom in on an image to change its appearance.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> or <strong class="bold">Set</strong>. If you choose <strong class="bold">Set</strong>, a dialog appears letting you define whether to use the image for the Home screen or Lock screen. The Lock screen appears when your iPhone<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> is locked. The Home screen appears when your iPhone is unlocked. This lets you display two different images if you wish, such as a neutral image when your iPhone is locked and a more personal image when your iPhone is unlocked.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Changing the look of your iPhone's Home and Lock screens can make your iPhone unique, but you may want to also change the way your iPhone sounds every time you receive a message or phone call. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Customizing sounds and haptics</h1>
			<p>By default, every iPhone<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> sounds the same, so if you don't change the<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> sound settings, you may think your iPhone is receiving a phone call or text message when it's really someone else's iPhone in the same room. If you want to personalize the way your iPhone sounds, take some time to modify its sound settings.</p>
			<p>In addition to changing the sound your iPhone makes when you receive a message, you can also define whether you want your iPhone to vibrate as a way to provide additional haptic feedback in case you can't hear your iPhone making a noise. For example, you can make it vibrate when you receive a phone call. That way, if you're in a noisy area and don't hear your<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> iPhone ring, you'll still feel it vibrating to let you know you have an incoming call. </p>
			<p>To define sounds and haptics to alert you, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Sounds &amp; Haptics</strong>. A screen appears listing the different sound options. You may need to scroll down to see all of the various options you can select, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.12</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.12 – The Sound &amp; Haptics options&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.12_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.12 – The Sound &amp; Haptics options</p>
			<p>Before changing any of the sound and haptic options, determine where you use your iPhone most often. If you use your iPhone in crowded places often, such as in an office or school, you may want to choose softer sounds that won't annoy anyone nearby and rely on haptics to provide vibrations as feedback.</p>
			<p>However, if you use <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>your iPhone outdoors, you may want to choose more unique<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> sounds, along with increasing the volume to make it easier to hear your iPhone. For additional feedback, turn <strong class="bold">System Haptics</strong> on so that even if you don't hear your iPhone, you can feel it vibrating to let you know when you've received a text message or phone call.</p>
			<p>Everyone has different uses and needs for sound and haptics, so feel free to experiment to see what you like best. For example, you may want to change the <strong class="bold">Keyboard Clicks</strong> setting to give you audio feedback when you've tapped a key. If you find this clicking noise too annoying, you can always turn it off again.</p>
			<p>Even if you prefer sounds, you may find them annoying when you want to work or concentrate. Rather than turn off all sound (and then turn it back on again later), you may want to temporarily disable sounds.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>Blocking out disturbances</h1>
			<p>No matter how much you may love your iPhone and your friends, you may need to focus on a task and you don't want your iPhone to keep beeping or making noises while you're trying to get <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>something done. One simple solution is to turn your iPhone off completely or leave it in another room so that you can't hear it. </p>
			<p>Yet a simpler <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>solution is to use the iPhone's <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> features to temporarily quiet your iPhone. The iPhone gives you two options for blocking out disturbances through the <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> feature:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Manually turning <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> on and off.</li>
				<li>Automatically turn <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> on and off <a id="_idTextAnchor159"/><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>at a specific time every day.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Manually turning on the <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> feature takes a conscious effort but can be handy when you temporarily need to block out potential disturbances. Automatically turning the <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> feature on and off can be handy to encourage you to set aside a specific time when you won't be distracted by your iPhone. </p>
			<p>To turn on the <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> feature, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.13</em>. You may need to scroll down to view all the options:<div><img alt="Figure 3.13 – The Do Not Disturb screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.13_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.13 – The Do Not Disturb screen</p></li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> to silence your iPhone. If you choose this option, you'll need to select this option again to allow sounds on your iPhone again.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Scheduled</strong> to define a <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>starting and ending time to disable sounds. If you choose this option, your iPhone will automatically <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>silence itself during the specified time you choose.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Always/While iPhone is Locked</strong> to define whether you want your iPhone to be silent all the time or just when it's locked.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Allow Calls From</strong> to define whether to receive calls from everyone, no one, or just people defined as your favorites or those stored in your <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Repeated Calls</strong> to allow repeated calls from the same person to get through.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Activate</strong> to detect when you're driving. It lets your iPhone turn on <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb </strong>when it detects you're driving, when it's connected to a car's Bluetooth, or manually.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Auto-Reply To</strong> to send an automated reply to anyone who tries to contact you<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/> when you have <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> turned on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When you've defined the<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> different audio settings just the way you like them, take a moment to customize the text and screen brightness as well. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>Adjusting text size and screen brightness</h1>
			<p>Depending on your <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>preference and eyesight, you may want to adjust the appearance of your iPhone's screen to modify the size of text and screen brightness. Changing the<a id="_idIndexMarker161"/> size of text can make text easier to read at the expense of showing less information, or showing more information at the expense of making text smaller and harder to read. By modifying text size, you can find the perfect balance for you.</p>
			<p>You may also want to adjust the screen brightness to a comfortable level. A screen that's too dim or bright can be hard to read. In addition, a screen that's too bright uses up more power that can drain your iPhone's battery, so adjusting the screen brightness can be important for your eyes and your iPhone's battery life.</p>
			<p>To adjust text size and screen brightness, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Display &amp; Brightness</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Display &amp; Brightness</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.14</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.14 – The Display &amp; Brightness screen for adjusting text size and screen brightness&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.14 – The Display &amp; Brightness screen for adjusting text size and screen brightness</p></li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Light/Dark</strong> to select light or dark mode.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Automatic </strong>to switch <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>from light to dark mode based on sunset and sunrise or a scheduled time you define.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Brightness</strong> to adjust a<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> slider to increase or decrease the screen brightness.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Night Shift</strong> to shift screen colors to adjust the closer it gets to the end of the day.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Auto-Lock</strong> to define a time period to automatically lock your iPhone.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Raise to Wake</strong> to turn the iPhone screen on when you raise it.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Text Size</strong> to adjust the size of the text displayed on the screen.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Bold Text</strong> to define the text as bold or not.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">View</strong> to set screen content larger or smaller.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've gotten the text size and screen brightness the way you like, you may want to customize the way your iPhone displays information such as date and time.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>Customizing date/time formats</h1>
			<p>Every region of the<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> world displays times and dates differently. In America, dates are written in the month, day, year format—such as January 14, 2021—while in other parts of the world, dates may be written in the year, month, day format – such as 2021, January 14. </p>
			<p>The same holds with time. Some people prefer a 24-hour time format, such as 13:25, while others prefer a 12-hour format, such as 1:25 P.M. However you prefer to see the date and time, you can change the format from the default setting.</p>
			<p>To customize the format of date and time, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">General</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Date &amp; Time</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Date &amp; Time</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.15</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.15 – The Date &amp; Time screen for customizing times&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.15 – The Date &amp; Time screen for customizing times</p></li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">24-Hour Time</strong> to set or disable 24-hour time format, such as 14:31.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Set Automatically</strong> to let your iPhone automatically set the time based on your current location.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Time Zone.</strong> When <strong class="bold">Set Automatically</strong> is off, this option lets you define the current date<a id="_idIndexMarker165"/> and time, along with the time zone you want to use.</li>
				<li>Tap the back button in the upper-left corner to return back to the <strong class="bold">General</strong> screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Language &amp; Region</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Language &amp; Region</strong> screen appears for letting you choose your preferred languages, along with temperature units (<strong class="bold">Celsius</strong> or <strong class="bold">Fahrenheit</strong>) and a world region to define the format of times, dates, and c<a id="_idTextAnchor165"/><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>urrency, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.16</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.16 – Defining a language and region&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.16_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.16 – Defining a language and region</p></li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> to define which calendar system to use: <strong class="bold">Gregorian</strong>, <strong class="bold">Japanese</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Buddhist</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In most cases, your iPhone<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> will default to the most common settings used in your part of the world, but you always have the option of changing these settings if you wish. Regardless of where you live, one additional feature you should modify is how your iPhone uses its battery. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>Customizing the battery</h1>
			<p>The iPhone's battery is designed to last for <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>several years, but over time, it will wear out and hold less of a charge over time. Even if your battery is in optimum condition, it will lose its charge during the day as you use it, so you may want to take the time to optimize your battery and adjust your own behavior by seeing which apps you use that tend to consume the most power.</p>
			<p>To see how to customize the battery on your iPhone, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Battery</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Battery</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.17</em>. You may need to scroll down to see all the availa<a id="_idTextAnchor168"/><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>ble options on the <strong class="bold">Battery</strong> screen:<div><img alt="Figure 13.17 – Date pickers let you select different dates and times&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.17 – Date pickers let you select different dates and times</p></li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Battery Percentage</strong> to define whether to display the battery's remaining power as a percentage of its strength (such as 75%) or not.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Low Power Mode</strong> to reduce <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>background tasks to conserve battery life at the expense of slowing down tasks.</li>
				<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Battery Health</strong> to view the strength of your battery and turn on optimized battery charging to reduce overcharging (and thus wearing out) your battery.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The bottom of the <strong class="bold">Battery</strong> screen lets you view your battery's charging levels over time, along with seeing which apps have been consuming the most power. By seeing which apps you use most often and that use the most power, you can adjust your usage to conserve pow<a id="_idTextAnchor170"/><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>er by using certain apps less often. </p>
			<p>Expect over time that your iPhone's battery will hold less and less charge. This is common with all types of electronic devices, but by monitoring which apps use the most power, you can change how you use your iPhone to conserve battery power during ordinary use.</p>
			<p>Battery life can be especially critical if you need to use your iPhone to call for help in an emergency. Since calling for help can take time, you might want to take a moment to set up emergency calls on y<a id="_idTextAnchor172"/><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>our iPhone.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Defining an emergency SOS</h1>
			<p>Imagine the worse. What if you're in a <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>car accident and are unable to<a id="_idIndexMarker170"/> use your hands to dial a phone number to call for help? Or what if you're in immediate danger from other people and don't have time to pull out your iPhone and call for the police?</p>
			<p>The answer is simple. Before you get into trouble, take a moment to turn on the iPhone's <strong class="bold">Emergency SOS</strong> calling feature, which lets you contact emergency services by pressing the sleep/wake button five times to call for help.</p>
			<p>To turn on this <strong class="bold">Emergency SOS</strong> feature, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Emergency SOS</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Emergency SOS</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.18</em>:<p class="figure-caption"> </p><div><img alt="Figure 3.18 – Turning on the Emergency SOS calling feature&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.18 – Turning on the Emergency SOS calling feature</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Auto-Call</strong>. If <strong class="bold">Auto-Call</strong> is turned on, you'll also have the option of <strong class="bold">Setting a Countdown Sound</strong>, which will alert you when your iPhone is about to make an emergency call. This<a id="_idIndexMarker171"/> countdown sound can alert you in case you accidentally trigger the emergency calling feature so that<a id="_idIndexMarker172"/> you'll have time to turn it off if you don't need help.<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p><p class="callout">For the elderly or people experiencing illness or other ailments that could make calling for help through an iPhone difficult, consider pairing your iPhone with an Apple Watch. An iPhone can only call emergency services if you're carrying it with you when you need help. Since an Apple Watch is attached to your wrist, it's more likely to be available during an emergency if your iPhone is not within easy reach.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Turning <strong class="bold">Emergency SOS</strong> on can be critical, so it's generally a good idea to turn it on since you never know when you might need it. </p>
			<p>One last feature you might want to customize is your privacy. Privacy extends beyond just keeping unauthorized people from accessing your iPhone, but also includes how other apps may access y<a id="_idTextAnchor175"/><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>our personal data stored on your iPhone.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Protecting your privacy</h1>
			<p>The more you <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>use your iPhone, the more likely it is that you'll store personal information, such as names and phone numbers in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app, personal and confidential messages in the <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> and Mail apps, or personal pictures in the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app that you may have captured through your iPhone's camera.</p>
			<p>While using passcodes, Touch ID, and Face ID can keep unauthorized people from accessing this private data, none of these security measures can keep apps from accessing your private data. </p>
			<p>For example, many apps may request permission to access your <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> data to help you find contact information for your friends. Graphic-oriented apps may also request permission to access your pictures in the <strong class="bold">Photos </strong>app to use them. </p>
			<p>If you're concerned that too many apps may have access to your private data, you can selectively block apps from specific data. That way, you can ensure that only the apps that are most important to you have access to your personal information.</p>
			<p>To check and disable which apps are accessing data from your iPhone, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Privacy</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Privacy</strong> screen appears, listing all the apps and features available on your iPhone, such as <strong class="bold">Calendars</strong>, <strong class="bold">Photos</strong>, <strong class="bold">Bluetooth</strong>, <strong class="bold">Microphone</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Health</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.19 </em><div><img alt="Figure 3.19 – Checking the privacy settings for different data and hardware&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.19_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.19 – Checking the privacy settings for different data and hardware</p></li>
				<li>Tap an app name (such as <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong>) or a feature (such as <strong class="bold">Camera</strong> or <strong class="bold">HomeKit</strong>) that you want to examine. Another screen appears, listing all the apps that have requested access to the specific data or hardware, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.20</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.20 – A list of apps requesting access to data or hardware&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.20_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.20 – A list of apps requesting access to data or hardware</p></li>
				<li>Turn on/off any apps you do<a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> or do not want to access the selected data or service.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Often, when running a new app for the first time, it will ask for permission to access data or har<a id="_idTextAnchor178"/><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>dware, such as asking to use the camera. If you do not give an app permission, it likely won't work at all or will work but with limited capabilities. So, it's often easier to give an app permission right away.</p>
			<p>However, you may want to periodically review which apps have permission to your data and services just to make sure you still want those apps to have access. While most apps won't maliciously steal your data, limiting access to your data and services can help you reduce the risk of losing important data, so review the privacy settings of different data and services to make sure you aren't giving too many apps access to your iPhone's data and services.</p>
			<p>Besides checking your privacy <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>settings periodically, you might also want to check your notification settings regularly as well. Notification settings let apps alert you when certain events occur. Since many apps want permission to notify you, you should define which apps are most important so that you aren't bombarded with notifications from apps that aren't that important to you. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>Defining notification settings</h1>
			<p>Certain apps may<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/> need to notify you when certain events occur. For example, the Calendar app may notify you of an upcoming appointment and the Clock app may need to notify you when you've set an alarm. </p>
			<p>Notifications allow apps to<a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> alert you when certain events occur, but you likely don't want every app to display notifications, or else they could prove annoying if notifications appear too often. You can set turning notifications on or off. If you turn notifications on, you can also define one or more of the following, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.21</em>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Alerts</strong>: Pops a window in the <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>middle of the screen to block everything until you dismiss the alert.</li>

			<p>By itself, an iPhone can connect to a<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> cellular phone network so that you can access the internet. However, you may want to avoid relying on a cellular network in case you get charged for excess data usage or if a cellular network may be spotty or unreliable in a particular area. When you want to avoid a cellular network, you can often rely on Wi-Fi instead.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>Setting Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and hotspots</h1>
			<p>Wi-Fi lets you<a id="_idIndexMarker189"/> connect an iPhone to the internet without paying additional data usage charges through a cellular network. Bluetooth lets you connect an iPhone to accessories<a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> such as an external keyboard or speakers. </p>
			<p>If a Wi-Fi hotspot does not exist<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/> but your iPhone can still connect to a cellular network, you can turn your iPhone into a Wi-Fi hotspot to let other devices (such as a laptop or tablet) connect to the internet through your iPhone. </p>
			<p>By connecting to a Wi-Fi network or Bluetooth devices, or turning your iPhone into a Wi-Fi hotspot, you can make sure you always stay connected with your iPhone.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">When connecting your iPhone to a Wi-Fi network that you do not personally control, be extremely careful about sending sensitive data such as passwords, banking information, or credit card numbers. That's because it's possible for thieves to intercept data sent to a Wi-Fi router from your iPhone.  </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Connecting to a Wi-Fi network</h2>
			<p>In many places, connecting to <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>a cellular network for an extended period of time costs extra. In that case, you may want to connect to a Wi-Fi network to avoid additional cellular network charges.</p>
			<p>Even if you live in a place that provides unlimited data, you may still want to connect to a Wi-Fi network since Wi-Fi will often be faster than a cellular network for browsing the internet, sending emails, or even making phone calls. </p>
			<p>To connect to a Wi-Fi network through your iPhone, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Wi-Fi</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Wi-Fi</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Wi-Fi</strong> switch to turn Wi-Fi on (or off). When the Wi-Fi switch is on, additional options appear, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.25</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.25 – The Wi-Fi screen for defining different connection settings&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.25_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.25 – The Wi-Fi screen for defining different connection settings</p></li>
				<li>Tap on a Wi-Fi network that you want to join. Wi-Fi networks that require a password will display a lock icon, while those Wi-Fi networks that do not require a password will not display a lock icon. If you selected a locked Wi-Fi network, an <strong class="bold">Enter Password</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.26</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.26 – The Enter Password screen for connecting to a locked Wi-Fi network&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.26_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.26 – The Enter Password screen for connecting to a locked Wi-Fi network</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the <strong class="bold">Password</strong> text field and type the password to access the Wi-Fi network.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Join</strong>. A checkmark <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>appears to the left of a Wi-Fi network name to let you know which network your iPhone is currently connected to (you can only connect to one Wi-Fi network at a time).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Connecting to a Wi-Fi network lets you access the internet without relying on a cellular network that may be slower and that will charge you extra per minute. If you want to connect your iPhone to external devices, such as keyboards or speakers, you'll need to turn on Bluetooth as well.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Turning on Bluetooth</h2>
			<p>Bluetooth is a <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>standard for connecting devices wirelessly in a short range (such as 1 meter or 3 feet). Because Bluetooth has such a short range, it's often used to connect external devices to an iPhone, such as a keyboard, speakers, or headphones. </p>
			<p>To turn Bluetooth on (or off), follow<a id="_idIndexMarker195"/> these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Bluetooth</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Bluetooth</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Bluetooth</strong> switch to turn it on. When the switch is turned on, a list of all the devices your iPhone can connect to through Bluetooth appears.</li>
				<li>Make sure the other device has Bluetooth turned on and tap the device you want to connect to your iPhone.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Bluetooth can be handy for <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>connecting to external devices, but what if you're stranded somewhere without an internet connection? That's when you might want to use your iPhone as a hotspot so that nearby laptops and tablets can connect to the nternet through your iPhone.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Creating a hotspot</h2>
			<p>The main purpose of a hotspot is <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>to connect your iPhone to a cellular network and then allow other devices, such as laptops or tablets, to connect to the internet through your iPhone. This can be a handy way to provide internet access to others, but keep in mind that you may be charged extra for data usage and that the internet connection may not be fast. That means you probably don't want to use an iPhone as a hotspot for data-intensive activities, such as streaming movies or playing online video games.  </p>
			<p>To turn your iPhone into a hotspot, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Personal Hotspot</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Personal Hotspot</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Allow Others to Join</strong> switch to turn it on. When the switch is turned on, a list of instructions appears for connecting other devices to your iPhone, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.27</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.27 – The Personal Hotspot screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.27_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.27 – The Personal Hotspot screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Wi-Fi Password</strong>. A Wi-Fi Password screen appears to let you define a password other people will need to type to connect to your iPhone.</li>

			</ol>
			<p>In most cases, you can use<a id="_idIndexMarker198"/> your iPhone with other devices without worrying about the technical details of your iPhone. However, in case you're curious or you need to know the specifics of your iPhone, you may need to know how to identify different parts of your iPhone, such as the version of iOS used or how much storage space you have left. To find out this information, you need to know how to look up your iPhone's technical details.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Finding information about your iPhone</h2>
			<p>In some cases, certain <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>apps or hardware devices will only work on specific types of iPhones. For example, an app or device might only work with an iPhone running a certain version of iOS or that has a specific type of processor. To find this information, you can look up details about your iPhone.</p>
			<p>To look up the technical features of your iPhone, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">General</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">About</strong>. The <strong class="bold">About</strong> screen appears, listing the details of your iPhone, such as its software version, model name and number, and available storage space, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.28</em>:</li>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.28 – The About screen for looking up information about an iPhone</p>
			<p>Perhaps the most<a id="_idIndexMarker200"/> important information to check is whether you're running the latest version of iOS or not. The latest version of iOS often fixes bugs and increases security, so make s<a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>ure you know how to update your iPhone's operating system.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>Updating an iPhone</h1>
			<p>An iPhone is nothing more than<a id="_idIndexMarker201"/> a computer running an operating system. With the iPhone, the <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>operating system is called iOS, which Apple updates annually with major changes and throughout the year with minor changes.</p>
			<p>Generally, you want to keep your iPhone updated to the latest operating system version since that will offer the most features, along with fixing bugs from previous operating system versions. However, sometimes the latest software updates can prove buggy, which means if you install it on your iPhone, you could wreck its performance.</p>
			<p>For that reason, you may want to turn off automatic updates. Automatic updates is designed to update your iPhone and keep it current without you having to consciously install the latest operating system yourself. However, you may want to wait before updating just in case people report troubles with the latest update.</p>
			<p>To modify automatic updates, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">General</strong>. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Software Update</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Automatic Updates</strong>. A switch appears so that you can turn automatic updates on or off.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Remember that the longer you keep your iPhone, the less likely it will be able to update to the latest version of iOS. Apple tends to support its products for around 5 years, so keeping your iPhone up to date ensures that it will be able to take advantage of the latest features of iOS. Even if your iPhone can no longer update to the latest version of iOS, it will still work just fine. As long as your iPhone continues doing what you need, that's all that matters anyway.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Using accessibility features</h1>
			<p>Some people have visual <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>difficulties, while others have hearing or physical limitations. Fortunately, the iPhone comes with options to make all its features accessible for everyone just as long as you take a little time defining different accessibility features.</p>
			<p>The iPhone divides accessibility features into the following categories: <strong class="bold">Vision</strong>, <strong class="bold">Physical and Motor</strong>, <strong class="bold">Hearing</strong>, and <strong class="bold">General</strong>. Although these accessibility features are designed for those who need them to be able to use the iPhone, anyone can use these accessibility features to make the iPhone easier to use.</p>
			<p>To access the<a id="_idIndexMarker204"/> accessibility features, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Accessibility</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Accessibility</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.29</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 3.29 – The Accessibility screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_3.29_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.29 – The Accessibility screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap an option you want to use, such as <strong class="bold">Zoom</strong> or <strong class="bold">Touch</strong>. Another screen appears, displaying various options you can define.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Everyone has<a id="_idIndexMarker205"/> different uses for the iPhone, so play around with the different accessibility features to see which ones might make your iPhone even easier to use.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>The iPhone provides many different ways to customize its settings, but most settings fall into one of three categories. Fun and personal changes represent settings that have no effect on the performance of your iPhone, such as changing the wallpaper image. </p>
			<p>Usability changes represent settings that can make your iPhone easier and more convenient to use, such as setting a <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> schedule or increasing the text size to make text easier to read. </p>
			<p>Potentially critical changes represent settings that could be important to your safety and the security of your data, such as setting up the <strong class="bold">Emergency SOS</strong> call feature or checking the privacy settings to make sure you aren't giving access to an app you no longer need.</p>
			<p>Remember, you don't need to modify all the possible settings. The same procedure for turning on a particular setting can be used to turn off that same setting, so make sure you know the steps for turning a feature on or off just in case you need to reverse this setting later.</p>
			<p>Once you've customized your iPhone's appearance and behavior, you may want to know how to use your iPhone to make phone calls, which is probably the main reason you bought an iPhone in the first place, and that's what the next chapter will cover.</p>
