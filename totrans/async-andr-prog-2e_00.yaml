- en: Whether you are Android beginner developer or an Android seasoned programmer,
    this book will explore how to achieve efficient and reliable multithreaded Android
    applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll look at best asynchronous constructs and techniques, commonly used by
    Android Developer community, to execute computation intensive or blocking tasks
    off the main thread, keeping the UI responsive, telling the user how things are
    going, making sure we finish what we started, using those powerful multicore processors,
    and doing it all without wasting the battery.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By using the right asynchronous construct, much of the complexity is abstracted
    from the developer, making the application source code more readable and maintainable
    and less error prone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using step-by-step guidelines and code examples, you will learn how manage interactions
    between several threads and avoid concurrency and synchronization problems that
    might occur when two or more threads access a shared resource to complete a background
    job, to update the UI or retrieve the latest application data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of this journey you will know how build well-behaved applications
    with smooth, responsive user-interfaces that delight users with speedy results
    and data that's always fresh.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Asynchronous Programming in Android"), *Asynchronous
    Programming in Android*, gives an overview of the Android process and thread model,
    and describes some of the challenges and benefits of concurrency in general, before
    discussing issues specific to Android.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Performing Work with Looper, Handler, and
    HandlerThread"), *Performing Work with Looper, Handler and HandlerThread* details
    the fundamental and related topics of `Handler`, `HandlerThread`, and `Looper`,
    and illustrates how they can be used to schedule tasks on the main thread, and
    to coordinate and communicate work between cooperating background threads.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Exploring the AsyncTask"), *Exploring the
    AsyncTask*, covers the most common concurrent construct of programming in Android.
    We learn how `AsyncTask` works, how to use it correctly, and how to avoid the
    common pitfalls that catch out even experienced developers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Exploring the Loader"), *Exploring the Loader*,
    introduces the `Loader` framework and tackles the important task of loading data
    asynchronously to keep the user interface responsive and glitch free.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Interacting with Services"), *Interacting
    with Services*, we explored the very powerful `Service` Android component, putting
    it to use to execute long-running background tasks with or without a configurable
    level of concurrency. This component gives us the means to perform background
    operations beyond the scope of a single `Activity` lifecycle and to ensure that
    our work is completed even if the user leaves the application.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Scheduling Work with AlarmManager"), *Scheduling
    Work with AlarmManager*, introduces to us a system API that could be used to defer
    work or create periodic tasks. The scheduled task could wake up the device to
    complete the work or alert users to new content.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Exploring the JobScheduler API"), *Exploring
    the JobScheduler API*, covers a job scheduling system API introduced with Android
    Lollipop that allows us to start background work when a set of device conditions,
    such as energy or network, are fulfilled.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Interacting with the Network"), *Interacting
    with the Network*, we cover in detail `HttpUrlConnection` Android HTTP client.
    With the `HttpUrlConnection` HTTP client, we will create an asynchronous toolkit
    that is able to fetch JSON documents, XML or text from a remote server.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Asynchronous Work on the Native Layer"),
    *Asynchronous Work on the Native layer*, introduces the JNI interface, an Java
    standard interface that will allow us to execute concurrent tasks on native code
    (C/C++), interact with the Java code from the native layer or update the UI from
    the native code.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Network Interactions with GCM"), *Network
    Interactions with GCM*, we will learn how to use the Google GCM to efficiently
    push and pull efficiently realtime messages from your server and how to schedule
    work with Google Play Services framework.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Exploring Bus-based Communications"), *Exploring
    Bus-based Communications*, we will introduce to the reader the publish-subscribe
    messaging pattern and the Event Bus Library, a publish-subscribe implementation
    that allow us to deliver asynchronous messages between Android application components.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. Asynchronous Programing with RxJava"),
    *Asynchronous Programing with RxJava*, we will introduce RxJava, a library used
    to easily compose asynchronous and event-based tasks on Java by using observable
    data streams.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To follow along and experiment with the examples, you will need a development
    computer with a Java 7 (or 8) SE Development Kit and the Android Software Development
    Kit Version 9 or above (you will need at least Version 21 to try all of the examples).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will also need Android Studio IDE. The examples have been developed using
    Google's new Android Studio IDE and use its integrated build system, Gradle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While you can run the examples using the emulator provided by the Android SDK,
    it is a poor substitute for the real thing. A physical Android device is a much
    faster and more pleasurable way to develop and test Android applications!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of the examples will work on a device running any version of Android since
    2.3, GingerBread. Some examples demonstrate newer APIs and as a result, require
    a more recent Android version—up to Android 5, Lollipop.
