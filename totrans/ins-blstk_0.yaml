    This book will walk you through the process of running BlueStacks on a computer
    and show you some of the ways in which you can make the most out of this emerging
    technology. There are other ways by which you can run an emulator of Android on
    your computer. You can, for instance, run a virtual machine or install the Android
    **Software Development Kit** (**SDK**). These assume a degree of technical understanding
    that isn't necessarily required with BlueStacks, making BlueStacks the quickest
    and easiest way of running apps on your computer.

    opens up a whole library of mature software designed for a touch interface. This
    is particularly useful for those wanting to use many, free, or cheap Android apps

    releases, so it is important that you take time to report the bugs that you may
    find to the developers through their website. The ongoing development and success
    of the software depends upon this feedback and results in a better product. If
    you become reliant on a particular feature, it is a good idea to highlight your
    love to the developers too. This can help influence which features are to be kept
    and improved upon as the product matures.
