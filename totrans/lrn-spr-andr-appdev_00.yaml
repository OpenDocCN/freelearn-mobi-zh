- en: This book is designed to develop both server and client for an application.
    We have used the Kotlin language for both the server and client sides. In this
    book, Spring will be the server-side application, and Android the client-side
    application. Our primary focus is on those areas that will be able to help a developer
    develop a secure application with the latest architecture. This book describes
    the basics of Kotlin and Spring, which will be of benefit if you are unfamiliar
    with these platforms. We also designed the chapters for implementing security
    and database in a project. This book delves into the use of Retrofit for handling
    HTTP requests and SQLite Room for storing data in an Android device. You will
    also be able to find a way of how to develop a robust, reactive project. Then,
    you will learn how to test a project using JUnit and Espresso for developing a
    less bug-prone and stable project.

- en: This book is designed for those developers who are new to Kotlin who wish to
    develop projects with Spring and Android. Spring for Android provides a functional
    REST client that supports marshaling objects from JSON. Developers depend on other
    language platforms, such as PHP and Python for REST API, but Spring comes with
    Java/Kotlin and a rich content that helps developers to use REST API with the
    maximum security. There are some dependencies in the application code and Spring
    removes these dependencies. Nowadays, Java is being replaced by Kotlin, which
    is lighter and requires fewer lines of code to finish the job.

    an environment for both the server side and client side. We will also look into
    the types of tools that will be needed for the project. We will also understand
    what we can create with a platform using Spring and Android.'

    covers the basics of Kotlin and examines how to set up the environment and which
    tools or IDEs are available for Kotlin, including basic syntax and types. We will
    see the flow structures, including `if-else` statements, `for` loops, and `while`
    loops. We will also look into the object-oriented programming for Kotlin and cover
    classes, interfaces, objects, and so on. Functions will also be covered, along
    with parameters, constructors, and syntax. We will also explain null safety, reflection,
    and annotations, which are the core features of Kotlin.'

    Framework*, covers the basics of Spring Framework and readers will learn how to
    configure Spring and beans. Dependency injection will be explained in this chapter,
    along with the architecture of Spring. Readers will learn about Spring MVC and
    Spring Boot, which are helpful for developing the application as quickly as possible.
    Spring Data modules will also be explained. We will also cover Spring Security,
    which provides authentication and other securities for the applications.'

    Android projects. An explanation of HTTP clients is provided. Objects to JSON
    marshaling will also be covered. We will learn how to start and set up the environment.
    HTTP request methods for both the RestTemplate and Retrofit modules, such as `POST`,
    `GET`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, will also be covered, along with the common functionality
    of other Spring modules and Maven dependency management.'

    how to register and configure security and authentication in the web server. We
    will also learn about the architecture of Spring Security and how to use it for
    clients. We will see the approach to securing an API for Android application and
    what the security flow will be. We will learn how to use Spring Security in relation
    to the REST API. Use of the basic authentication, OAuth2, implicit flow, and the
    authorization code flow will also be discussed. We will also learn how to connect
    with Android projects and use basic authentication.'

    Spring on the web server and make a project design. We will then create UI, layout,
    and RESTful web services and retrieve JSON from the APIs. We will also learn to
    use Spring Boot and Spring Security for the app. We will then learn how to use
    Basic Auth to secure the data and give access to users. We will use secured REST
    API for an Android app and how to handle contents in Android. This application
    will be based on Kotlin, and we will be taking advantage of the features of Kotlin
    features, features including null safety, reflection, and annotation, in this

    uses. We will get to know the test structure for the project, along with the testing
    tools such as JUnit and Espresso. Test cases for JUnit and JPA will also be discussed.
    We will learn how to write UI test cases for the Android application. We will
    also learn to execute these tests via Android Studio. We will also learn how to
    test UI using Espresso in Kotlin, and its uses in relation to Kotlin in the Android
    app. We will also look into concurrency and reactive programming in the application.'
