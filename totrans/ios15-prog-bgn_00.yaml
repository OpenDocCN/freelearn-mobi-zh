- en: Welcome to iOS 15 Programming for Beginners. This book is the sixth edition
    of the iOS Programming for Beginners series, and has been fully updated for iOS
    15, macOS 12.0 Monterey, and Xcode 13.

- en: In this book, you will build a restaurant reservation app called *Let's Eat*.
    You will start off by exploring Xcode, Apple's programming environment, also known
    as its **Integrated Development Environment** (**IDE**). Next, you will start
    learning the foundations of Swift, the programming language used in iOS apps,
    and see how it is used to accomplish common programming tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have a solid foundation of using Swift, you will start creating the
    user interface of the *Let's Eat* app. During this process, you will work with
    storyboards and connect your app's scenes together using segues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With your user interface complete, you will then add code to implement your
    app's functionality. To display your data in a grid, you will use collection views,
    and to display your data in a list, you will use table views. You will also look
    at how to add basic and custom annotations on to a map. You'll see how you can
    use JSON files to get actual restaurant data into your collection views, table
    views, and map. You'll enable users to add ratings, reviews and photos for a particular
    restaurant, which you'll save using Core Data.

- en: You now have a complete app, but how about adding the latest iOS 15 features?
    You'll start by modifying your app to work on both iPhone and iPad, and make it
    work on Macs. Next, you will learn how to develop apps using SwiftUI, a great
    new way of developing apps for all Apple platforms. After that, you'll implement
    asynchronous and parallel programming using Swift Concurrency, and implement shared
    user experiences for your app using SharePlay.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, you'll learn how to test your app with internal and external testers,
    and get it into the App Store.
