- en: This is the final part of this book, where we have unleashed the power of code
    design and architecture. We will cover different design patterns, such as MVVM
    and Dependency Injection, discuss architecture, and prepare for coding assessments.
    By the end of this part, we will be ready to successfully conclude the interview
    and receive our job proposal.
