- en: OpenGL ES 3.0 is a royalty free, hardware-accelerated graphics rendering application
    programming interface for embedded systems. It is used for visualizing 2D and
    3D graphics with the modern programmable graphics pipeline. "Write once, use anywhere"
    is truly the power behind OpenGL ES, which has made it an embedded industry standard.
    OpenGL ES 3.0 is a cross-platform graphics library and opens its gates to many
    other cutting-edge technologies, such as parallel processing libraries (OpenCL)
    and digital image processing (OpenCV) that works in conjunction with many other
    open community solutions.

- en: The main strength of this book is that it covers development of real-time rendering
    graphics and visualization development using OpenGL ES 3.0 from scratch. It lets
    the user know how to define the framework for the OpenGL ES 3.0 application. These
    are some of the techniques that make this book entirely different from other books
    available on the market. The idea behind this book is to give you an in-depth
    knowledge of this new version of graphics API and use it to implement computer
    graphics fundamentals and advance concepts from scratch using Android and iOS
    as embedded platforms. This book covers a lot of ground, from basic concepts of
    modern 3D graphics to advanced real-time rendering techniques using OpenGL ES
    3.0.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. OpenGL ES 3.0 on Android/iOS"), *OpenGL ES
    3.0 on Android/iOS*, takes you through the process of how to develop the Android
    and iOS OpenGL ES 3.0 application. This chapter shows you how to load and compile
    a shader program apart from the process to program shaders in GL shading language
    3.0.'

    Essentials*, provides you with a detailed description of the basic concepts that
    are required to understand 3D graphics and implement them using OpenGL ES 3.0\.
    We will build prototypes using the GLPI framework and implement touch events and
    scene with model, view, and projection analogy.'

    of OpenGL ES 3.0*, helps you understand the various new features introduced in
    OpenGL ES 3.0 and GL shading language 3.0\. This chapter tells you how to manage
    variable attributes with qualifiers and render multiple objects with geometry
    instancing and primitives with primitive restart.'

    teaches you how to create simple meshes using Blender, which is an open source
    3D modeling tool. In addition, this chapter covers various aspects of the 3D mesh
    model that will be helpful to render them in 3D graphics. This chapter also teaches
    how to use the created mesh model in OpenGL ES 3.0 applications.'

    gives you an in-depth understanding on the shaders programming technique. It discusses
    various techniques that can be implemented using the vertex and fragment shader,
    revealing their capabilities. This chapter helps you play with fragments by programing
    them using procedural shaders.'

    and Mapping Techniques*, sheds some light on textures, which is a very interesting
    part of the 3D computer graphics study. Texturing is a technique in which the
    surface of a 3D mesh model is painted with static images. This chapter is all
    about image texturing and explains its various applications in the field of 3D
    computer graphics. This chapter covers ample techniques on mapping, such as environment,
    bump, displacement mapping, and so on.'
