Swift was arguably the most significant announcement at WWDC 2014, and very few people, including Apple insiders, were aware of the project's existence prior to it being announced.</p><p>At WWDC 2015, Apple made another big splash when they announced Xcode 7 and Swift 2, which is a major enhancement to the Swift language. During WWDC, Chris Lattner said that a lot of the enhancements were based on direct feedback that Apple received from the development community.</p><p>Swift can be thought of as Objective-C reimagined using modern concepts and safe programming patterns. In Apple's own words, Swift is like "Objective-C without the C". Chris, the creator of Swift, said that Swift took language ideas from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list.</p><p>Apple has also stated that "Swift is a successor to the C and Objective-C languages". Therefore, it is imperative for iOS and OS X developers who want to keep their skills up to date to not only learn, but also master the Swift programming language.</p><p>The first five chapters of this book will introduce the reader to the Swift programming language. These chapters will give the reader a solid understanding of the Swift programming language. The remainder of the book will cover more advanced topics such as concurrency, network development, protocol extensions, and design patterns that will help the reader master this language.</p><p>This book is written in an example-based approach where each topic covered is backed by examples, which are written to reinforce the topic and show how to implement it within the reader's code.</p><p>Since Swift is constantly changing and evolving, I've started a blog at <a class="ulink" href="http://masteringswift.blogspot.com/">http://masteringswift.blogspot.com/</a> to keep the readers up to date with what is new with Swift. The blog will also be used to enhance and expand on the material in the book.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Taking the First Steps with Swift">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Taking the First Steps with Swift</em></span>, will introduce you to the Swift programming language and discuss what inspired Apple to create Swift. We'll also go over the basic syntax of Swift and how to use Playgrounds to experiment and test Swift code.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Learning about Variables, Constants, Strings, and Operators">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Learning about Variables, Constants, Strings, and Operators</em></span>, will introduce you to variables and constants in Swift and when to use them. There will be brief overviews of the most common variable types with examples on how to use them. We'll conclude this chapter by showing examples of how to use the most common operators in the Swift language.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Using Collections and Cocoa Data Types">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Collections and Cocoa Data Types</em></span>, will explain Swift's array, set, and dictionary collection types and show examples on how to use them. We'll also show how to use Cocoa and Foundation data types with Swift.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Control Flow and Functions">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Control Flow and Functions</em></span>, will show you how to use Swift's control flow statements. These include looping, conditional, and control transfer statements. The second half of the chapter is all about functions and how to define and use them.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Classes and Structures">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Classes and Structures</em></span>, is dedicated to Swift's classes and structures. We'll look at what makes them similar and what makes them different. We'll also look at access controls and object-oriented design. We'll close this chapter out by looking at memory management in Swift.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Using Protocols and Protocol Extensions">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Protocols and Protocol Extensions</em></span>, will cover both protocols and protocol extensions in detail since protocols are very important to the Swift language, and having a solid understanding of them will help us write flexible and reusable code.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Writing Safer Code with Availability and Error Handling">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Writing Safer Code with Availability and Error Handling</em></span>, will cover the new approach to error handling, which Apple included in Swift 2, in depth as well as the new availability feature. Error handling is the process of responding to and recovering from error conditions.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Working with XML and JSON Data">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with XML and JSON Data</em></span>, will discuss what XML and JSON data are and their uses. We'll then see several examples of how to parse and build XML and JSON data using Apple's frameworks.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Custom Subscripting">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Custom Subscripting</em></span>, will discuss how we can use custom subscripts in our classes, structures, and enumerations. Subscripts in Swift can be used to access elements in a collection. We can also define custom subscripts for our classes, structures, and enumerations.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Using Optional Types">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Optional Types</em></span>, will explain what optional types really are, what are the various ways to unwrap them, and optional chaining. For a developer who is just learning Swift, optional types can be one of the more confusing items to learn.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Working with Generics">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Generics</em></span>, will explain how Swift implements generics. Generics allow us to write very flexible and reusable code that avoids duplication.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Working with Closures">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Closures</em></span>, will teach us how to define and use closures in our code. Closures in Swift are similar to blocks in Objective-C except that they have a much cleaner and easier way of using syntax. We will conclude this chapter with a section on how to avoid strong reference cycles with closures.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Using Mix and Match">Chapter 13</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Mix and Match</em></span>, will explain mix and match and demonstrate how we can include Swift code in our Objective-C projects and Objective-C code in our Swift projects. With all of the apps and frameworks written in Objective-C, it was important to allow Swift and Objective-C code to work together.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Concurrency and Parallelism in Swift">Chapter 14</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Concurrency and Parallelism in Swift</em></span>, will show how to use both Grand Central Dispatch and Operation Queues to add concurrency and parallelism to our applications. Understanding and knowing how to add concurrency and parallelism to our apps can significantly enhance the user experience.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Swift Formatting and Style Guide">Chapter 15</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Swift Formatting and Style Guide</em></span>, will define a style guide for the Swift language that can be used as a template for enterprise developers who need to create a style guide since most enterprises have style guides for the various languages that they develop in.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch16.html" title="Chapter 16. Network Development with Swift">Chapter 16</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Network Development with Swift</em></span>, will explain the Apple API's to connect to remote servers and how best to use them. Network development can be both fun and challenging.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch17.html" title="Chapter 17. Adopting Design Patterns in Swift">Chapter 17</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Adopting Design Patterns in Swift</em></span>, will show you how to implement some of the more common design patterns in Swift. A design pattern identifies a common software development problem and provides a strategy for dealing with it.</p></div></div>
