Now you'll need to know how to manage a successful campaign that reaches your target demographic, comes within budget, and has a quantifiable way of measuring success.</p></blockquote></div><p>In this chapter, we'll look at the skills you'll need to ensure that you get the most out of your iAd campaign, such as the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Targeting your ad at specific audiences</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding pricing models and costs</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Reporting and analytics on a user's interactions within your ad</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Taking your ad live and the final pre-submission checks</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec01"/>Finding your audience</h1></div></div></div><p>With iAd we're able to run campaigns that require the user, or the context your ad appears in, to meet a specific group of criteria so you can target your iAd at your ideal audience.<a class="indexterm" id="id355"/>
</p><p>Finding your target audience can be complicated, as there are many influencing factors on who could be interested in your product or brand.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note124"/>Note</h3><p>Your target market may not necessarily be who you'd expect it to be or who you'd like it to be! So, make sure you're aware of whom you should be targeting before you launch your campaign.</p></div><p>If you've got an existing customer base, you can profile them to identify trends and common interests; consider giving customers short surveys and asking them questions, or holding focus groups. Although finding your target market is important, make sure that you don't annoy your existing customer base when trying to glean information from them!</p><p>You may want to adapt your market research once you know what targeting options are available to you. Let's take a look at the different types of targeting.<a class="indexterm" id="id356"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec01"/>Targeting</h2></div></div></div><p>With a clear market highlighted, you'll be able to tailor and customize your campaign to maximize its efficiency. This will increase the value of your iAd impressions, by gaining more useful user engagement, and by targeting the relevant demographics that are likely to be interested in your ad and brand. Ads can be targeted with contextual or behavioral data to reach the most likely audience that will be interested and engaged with your iAd.<a class="indexterm" id="id357"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec01"/>Contextual advertising</h3></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Contextual advertising</strong> assumes an advert is relevant because the context it appears in must be of interest to the user as they're viewing or using it. The best example of contextual advertising are sponsored links on websites. They generally analyze the content of a page and try to pick up on the general theme or context by finding common keywords.<a class="indexterm" id="id358"/>
</p><p>The following screenshot shows an example website with advertisements being placed using contextual targeting. When the page loads, it examines the general content of the page and picks out common words and themes, and fetches any ads it thinks might be relevant from the ad network:</p><div><img alt="Contextual advertising" src="img/1321_09_01.jpg"/></div><p>You'll find they're often not perfect; for example, a site that mentions rock several times may generate adverts about both AC/DC and the next public convention about the unexpected igneous formations found in South Dakota.<a class="indexterm" id="id359"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec02"/>Behavioral targeting</h3></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Behavioral targeting</strong> analyzes and builds up a profile of users based on their actions, which the advertising network has access to. The user's web journeys can be tracked as they visit different sites or make searches to find trends, which the ad network can then collate and use to make an educated guess of the user's demographic and interests.<a class="indexterm" id="id360"/>
</p><p>Advertising networks especially use behavioral targeting, because they're able to track a user as they navigate between sites on their ad network. For example, if a user goes onto a site about scuba diving, then a hotel site, and finally an airline booking page—it's likely that he is going on holiday. The ad provider then takes this assumption and starts displaying adverts on non-holiday related sites about taking a trip. It uses similar techniques to contextual targeting to highlight the keywords on a page and gauge a common theme.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note125"/>Note</h3><p>Advertising networks use controversial<strong> tracking cookies</strong> —a small file saved on your computer to save anonymous session and state data. Cookies are usually used to keep you logged in to websites or remember what's in your shopping cart, but advertisers can use the same technique to anonymously identify a visitor from site to site.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec03"/>iAd targeting</h3></div></div></div><p>iAd uses a combination of contextual advertising with behavioral targeting to help you find the most relevant and valuable audience for your iAd. Your ad can specify what categories of apps it will appear in or target the user's general preference of app categories.<a class="indexterm" id="id361"/>
</p><p>Thanks to Apple's profiling of a user with their iTunes store account and device information, we're able to target our campaigns with the following user behaviors and information:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Demographics</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Application preferences</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Music passions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Movie, TV, and audiobook genre interests</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Location</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Device (iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Network (Wi-Fi and 3G)</li></ul></div><p>With demographics, you're able to target by groups of people, with the ability to filter users by age, sex, and other information, anonymously available on their iTunes profiles. Location is ideal when you don't have a global brand presence because you're able to target by country or region. If you're selling digital goods within your app, you should only target countries where you app or content is available.</p><p>Application preferences use the download history of a user to estimate what category of apps they're interested in. This, combined with music, movie, TV interests, and some assumptions, can be a great way of finding users that match your ideal customer.</p><p>You'll have to liaise with your iAd Agent to set up and tweak your campaign and contact them early to discuss and get their feedback on the standard targeting they will be able to provide for your campaign.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec02"/>Pricing models</h1></div></div></div><p>With television and radio advertising, we're unsure about how engaged a viewer or listener is with our campaign; their attention could be (and often is) elsewhere. With iAd, we're almost guaranteed the user is immersed with our content, as they've opted to interact with it. This makes the cost per engagement with iAd more valuable. Typically, you'll find that you pay more for advertisements that target more popular demographics, but how this is measured and charged to you depends on the pricing model used.<a class="indexterm" id="id362"/>
</p><p>Mobile advertising follows an advertising model similar to the Internet channels that you may be familiar with. If you aren't, or want a refresher, we'll take a look at the current models and a world of acronyms.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec02"/>Cost per Millie (CPM)</h2></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Cost per Millie (CPM)</strong>  is where you pay for impressions of your advertisement. Millie is Latin for thousand, therefore CPM is what it costs to show your ad banner or link to 1000 viewers.<a class="indexterm" id="id363"/>
</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note126"/>Note</h3><p>CPM is often confused with Cost per Million. Make sure you don't confuse it or else your campaign will appear much cheaper than it is! Sometimes CPM is referred to as CPI or Cost Per Impression.</p></div><p>CPM is the most common pricing model in advertising, because it is easily mapped to traditional print or TV advertising, in which copies sold or ratings would be used to determine the effective number of eyeballs viewing the ad.<strong> Eyeballs</strong> is the term coined by the advertising industry for viewers of their advertisements. With iAd, we refer to people interacting with our ads as users, because they're more important and engaged than a basic viewer, thanks to iAd's compelling ads. With CPM, you're paying to show the viewer your banner, regardless of whether they decide to click or tap on it.</p><p>We can calculate the cost per impression of our ad by taking the CPM price and dividing it by 1000. For example, a campaign with a CPM which costs $20 would represent a fee of $0.02 every time a user views your ad's banner.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec03"/>Pay per Click (PPC)</h2></div></div></div><p>I'm sure in time we'll call this pay per tap, but in this model, you pay whenever a user clicks the link to your website or taps the banner of your ad. The<strong> Cost per Click (CPC)</strong>  is the average of how much each click (or tap) will cost you. No matter how many impressions your banner receives, you only have to pay whenever your banner is tapped and your ad opened. Paying per click can be more valuable than CPM, as you only have to pay when a user shows an interest and taps your banner to begin engaging with your brand.<a class="indexterm" id="id364"/>
</p><p>There are two sub-pricing models with pay per click, either flat rate or bid-based.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec04"/>Flat rate PPC</h3></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Flat rate pay per click</strong> uses a preagreed rate between the advertiser (you) and the publisher (say, Apple). With flat rate, you'll know exactly how much every tap of your banner will cost you.<a class="indexterm" id="id365"/>
</p><p>For example, if your PPC rate is $1.50, and 1000 users tap your banner, you'll have to pay $1500, regardless of how many impressions your banner receives.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec05"/>Bid PPC</h3></div></div></div><p>With<strong> Bid pay per click</strong>, you partake in a bidding war with other advertisers for the banner slot. You decide the maximum you're willing to pay per click, and the publishing network picks the highest bidder more often when displaying banners. You still only have to pay when a user clicks your banner, not per impression.<a class="indexterm" id="id366"/>
</p><p>If you're willing to pay more per click, then the ad network is more likely to show your banner over a competing banner. You'll usually only pay a little over the bidder below you, instead of your maximum bid price.</p><p>With a maximum bid of $2 per click, receiving 1000 clicks could cost anything from $10 to $2000.</p><p>Bid pay per click can be cost effective when you're targeting niche markets that have few competing advertisers in them.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec04"/>Cost per Action (CPA)</h2></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Cost per Action(CPA)</strong> is similar to PPC, but this time, you're paying for a conversion or action from the user. This could be paying to get more fans on Facebook, more followers on Twitter, or sign-ups to your mailing list.<a class="indexterm" id="id367"/>
</p><p>For example, if you're willing to pay $0.50 every time a user downloads your $2.99 app from your ad, achieving 1000 sales would cost you $500.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec05"/>iAd's pricing model</h2></div></div></div><p>iAd uses a mixed model, where you pay for a set number of impressions and additionally pay per tap/click for opening your ad. This is effectively a flat rate PPC combined with a CPM.<a class="indexterm" id="id368"/>
</p><p>You can expect to pay a CPM of around $10, that's $0.01 per banner impression, and a PPC of approximately $2.00. To get details on pricing and minimum campaign commitments contact Apple at<a class="ulink" href="http://advertising.apple.com"> http://advertising.apple.com</a>, as prices significantly vary from campaign to campaign and the scale of your brand.</p><p>With iAd for Developers, the scheme from Apple where they provide the basic iAd to advertise an app available on the App Store, Apple usually operates an exclusive CPC model. Only paying for clicks and not impressions reduces the barrier of entry and the CPC is approximately $0.25. However, you're unable to modify the iAd Developer ad template beyond the banner so your ads will lack such a compelling experience compared to your iAd Producer ads.<a class="indexterm" id="id369"/>
</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec03"/>Measuring success</h1></div></div></div><p>iAd Producer has an inbuilt analytic logging system, which by default, monitors and captures anonymous user data. This data is sent to the iAd Network, where Apple collates it to generate rich reports that you can access to monitor the engagement and success of your ad.<a class="indexterm" id="id370"/>
</p><p>By default, iAd Producer enables logging on live ads, but we're able to view the raw data of our development ads and tweak it to provide an even deeper analysis of our iAd project.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec04"/>Time for action — viewing the logs</h1></div></div></div><p>When we're developing our ad, we're able to view what logs will be sent to the iAd Network using a couple of lines of JavaScript. To view the logs, follow the ensuing steps:<a class="indexterm" id="id371"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Open an existing project in iAd Producer. In this example, we'll be using the<code class="literal"> Dino Stores</code> iPhone iAd that we'd been working on earlier in this book.</li><li class="listitem">We need to enable certain objects and pages for analytic events. This means our analytics only contains the meaningful data we choose. Open the<strong> Menu</strong> page on the ad canvas and expand the inspector pane. Click on<strong> Analytics</strong> to expand it and tick the<strong> Log Analytics Events</strong> box. The<strong> Log ID</strong> is auto-generated from the page name. So, if you've been giving your pages meaningful names, you probably won't have to change it. You can see the<strong> Analytics</strong> section in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="Time for action — viewing the logs" src="img/1321_09_02.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">The<strong> Analytics</strong> section of the inspector pane also appears when you've selected an individual object, so you're able to make certain objects active within a page to generate logging events.</li><li class="listitem">Return to the ad overview and select<strong> Code</strong> |<strong> Project Events</strong>, followed by<strong> Execute JavaScript</strong>, and finally,<strong> adDidFinishLaunching</strong>, from the menu bar.

Once live, your ad will always submit this logging data. This flag merely causes the logs to appear in the debugger. Each time a log appears in the debugger, there's a small performance cost, which is why we should remove unnecessary logs before submission. To disable the logging either remove the code that we added or change the<code class="literal"> true</code> to<code class="literal"> false</code>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec06"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>Using the default logging in iAd Producer, we previewed the information that Apple records and sends to the iAd Network for us to view later. This high level of event logging means that we can gain insights into the most interesting and popular sections of our ad and brand.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec05"/>Customizing the logs</h1></div></div></div><p>While the default logging provided by iAd Producer is comprehensive and useful, we're able to modify its behavior to better suit our ad. For example, out-of-the-box iAd Producer won't log our custom event functions, but that's easy to fix.<a class="indexterm" id="id374"/>
</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec06"/>Time for action — customizing the logs</h1></div></div></div><p>We'll customize our log messages to ensure that they're logical and understandable when we later come to analyze them. In order to customize the logs, follow the ensuing steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">We'll need an iAd Producer project that contains custom events. For this exercise, let's use the<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> ad that we made earlier.</li><li class="listitem">Select an object that has custom events set, for example, the<strong> Tell a Friend</strong> button on the menu page of our<code class="literal"> Coffee Beans</code> project.

We modified the ID used in the logs to a value, which will be more understandable and useful when it reaches the iAd Network and appears in the reports.</p><p>With this vast amount of data being collected and processed, it can be difficult to separate and identify common areas.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec07"/>Time for action — using sections</h1></div></div></div><p>iAd Producer lets us segment our analytics into sections, to make it easier to separate the results.

This means any analytics logging generated by these pages, such as it coming into view or the user interacting with the content, will be filterable in the iAd reporting interface. While sections might not seem necessary or too powerful in smaller ads, when you start pushing the boundaries of iAd Producer with hidden navigation and advanced page structures, it'll quickly become vital.</p><p>This data is collected and collated by Apple and is available in reports. You'll need to contact your iAd Account Manager for information on how to access this. By grouping data into sections, analyzing the popular and engaging parts of your ad can be made much easier. You can map trends, and tweak and update your ad and campaign to match these responses. For example, if you notice more people using your store finder than your e-mail sharing feature, you could put more emphasis on the store finder or even consider opening additional stores in popular areas.<a class="indexterm" id="id378"/>

If you can't remember how to export and transfer your optimized ads to your device, refer back to<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Making Sure It Works"> Chapter 4</a>,<em>Making Sure It Works.</em></p></div><p>Here, we can see the unoptimized, exported source code of one of our project's map views:</p><div><img alt="Going live" src="img/1321_09_06.jpg"/></div><p>When you export an optimized version of your ad iAd Producer, uses several techniques to reduce the size of your ad and increase the efficiency of your iAd, such as:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Removing unnecessary whitespace:</strong> While the spaces in your code make it more readable, they waste bandwidth when transferring your ad wirelessly to the user.<a class="indexterm" id="id379"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Changing variable names to single characters:</strong> Again, just like with whitespace, using readable names isn't required by machines, so we can reduce the bytes sent to the user by replacing them with shorter names. For example,<code class="literal"> myLongVariableName</code> would get renamed to<code class="literal"> a</code>, saving approximately 17 bytes whenever your ad is transferred.<a class="indexterm" id="id380"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Combining files:</strong> Fetching each file from the iAd Network has an extra overhead, while the device and servers communicate with each other. Your optimized ads combine several files into one to reduce this.<a class="indexterm" id="id381"/></li></ul></div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note133"/>Note</h3><p>You may remember that we used an<strong> image sprite</strong>, in an earlier chapter, to reduce the requests to the server by combining lots of images into one large image, then only showing the required parts at any time.</p></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Creating a manifest file:</strong> A manifest file is part of the HTML5 spec and tells the device which files to prefetch and cache, to ensure that your ad transitions smoothly from page to page, without the user having to wait for additional content to load. The caching should improve the experience for users on intermitted connections, as the iAd framework will try to download resources whenever a connection is available.<a class="indexterm" id="id382"/></li></ul></div><p>Here, we can see the optimized source code for our project's map page, after these techniques have been applied:</p><div><img alt="Going live" src="img/1321_09_07.jpg"/></div><p>It's important to validate your ad before submission. This will highlight any issues with assets or content, within your iAd. To validate your ad, you'll need to select<strong> Export</strong> |<strong> Show Project Warnings</strong>. We looked at fixing any issues in<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Making Sure It Works"> Chapter 4</a>,<em> Making Sure It Works</em>; check back there if your project has any warnings that you're unsure about.</p><p>After you've tested and validated your ad, the next step is to submit the ad to the iAd Network for approval and publication. To submit your ad to the iAd Network, you'll need to contact your iAd Agent to activate your account for live submissions and provide you with submission instructions.</p><p>Once you have committed to your iAd campaign, you should contact Apple to begin setting up your iAd account and get more information about the costs, estimated impressions, and clicks your campaign should be expected to generate.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec11"/>Have a go hero — test submission</h2></div></div></div><p>Take one of your existing projects and simulate taking it live.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec09"/>Tracking the campaign</h1></div></div></div><p>Once you have gone live, you'll need to analyze the reports generated by the analytics, along with the cost of your campaign. Campaign costs are the combined CPC and CPM from your ad. Apple shows you these broken down on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>Here's an example report for a campaign that has been running for three days:<a class="indexterm" id="id383"/>
</p><div><img alt="Tracking the campaign" src="img/1321_09_08.jpg"/></div><p>
<strong>Ad Spend</strong> is the combined CPC and CPM cost for a day. You're able to set a limit for the maximum daily amount that you're willing to spend. Once your daily limit has been reached, your ads won't be delivered by the network until the next calendar day.<a class="indexterm" id="id384"/>
</p><p>
<strong>Impressions</strong> and<strong> Clicks</strong> are the number of times your banner appears in an app and the number of user's that have clicked your banner to explore the core ad experience, respectively.</p><p>
<strong>Click-Through Rate (CTR)</strong> can be calculated by working out the percentage of impressions that resulted in the user tapping your banner and viewing your ad. If you have a low CTR, say under 5 percent, you should consider making your banner more compelling, to entice more users to tap it, or tuning your ads targeting to reach a market more interested audience.<a class="indexterm" id="id385"/>
