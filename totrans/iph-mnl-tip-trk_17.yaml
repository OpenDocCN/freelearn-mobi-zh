    you want it to be. Besides letting you make phone calls and send text messages,
    an iPhone can also be a timepiece and a source for news. Two common types of news
    that people often want are weather forecasts and stock quote information.

- en: An iPhone comes with the Clock app for not only helping you keep track of time
    in other parts of the world, but also to serve as a timer and stopwatch so that
    you can keep track of minutes or seconds to time yourself for exercising, cooking,
    or any other activity that involves keeping track of time.

    any city around the world. This way, you can know the temperatures and climate
    in another part of the world that you may be traveling to soon so that you can
    dress appropriately.

    way, you can keep track of your portfolio and follow your favorite stocks to see
    how they're doing during the day.
