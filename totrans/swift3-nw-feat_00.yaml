- en: With the release of Swift 3, Apple is seeking to increase adoption of Swift.
    The mission of this book is to very quickly get new and seasoned developers up
    to speed and productive with Swift 3\. We will explore the major features introduced
    to Foundation and the Standard Library. We will also provide commentary on how
    to convert existing Swift 2.2 projects to Swift 3 and examine Swift’s support
    for running and developing on Linux.

    Thinking?*, introduces you to Swift 3\. Swift is an important language for Apple
    and its adoption rate has been amazing so far. We will cover the process for how
    changes to the language are selected and how the community can contribute. In
    addition, we will cover Swift.org and Apple’s Github page as the repositories
    for everything that is happening in Swift.'

    *Discovering New Territories - Linux at Last!*, discusses that, while Mac development
    was your only supported option up until recently, Swift 3 supports developing
    and running Swift applications on a Linux machine. Our goal is get your development
    environment setup on both a Mac and a Linux machine by the end of this chapter.
    We will write our first Linux application together.'

    *Migrating to Swift 3 to Be More Swifty,* will show how to use the Swift Migrator
    to upgrade our Swift 2.2 projects.  We will use a sample project to walk through
    using the migrator and outline some useful strategies when migrating a Swift project.'

    for More"), *Changes to Swift''s Core Will Have Asking for More*, will quickly
    highlight the philosophies for writing good Swift APIs. Afterwards, we will spend
    the remaining chapter on language improvements for referencing and using Objective-C
    features in Swift 3 and importing code from Objective-C and C to Swift 3.'

    those changes translate into better Swift code. We will also explain operator
    changes and highlight several that have been removed from the language.'

    That Rock!"), *Extra, Extra Collection and Closure Changes That Rock!*, here we
    are focusing on collection and closure changes in Swift 3\. There are several
    nice additions that will make working with collections even more fun. We will
    also explore some of the confusing side effects of creating closures in Swift
    2.2 and how those have been fixed in Swift 3.'

    Swift on the Server*, shows that Swift running on Linux is a big deal, especially
    with Linux’s popularity for hosting and running servers. Swift 3 opens the possibilities
    for developers to create server-side applications using the same Swift that they
    use to create applications on iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. By the end of this
    chapter, you will have a running server written completely in Swift on a Linux
    box.'
