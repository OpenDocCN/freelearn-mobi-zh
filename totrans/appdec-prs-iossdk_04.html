Analytics provides you with data and shows how it's impacting the customer base. Analytics helps organizations and management take vital decisions to move forward and make business plans and strategies. You can get the detailed knowledge of customer behavior using analytics.</p><p>Parse provides you with in-built support for analytics. It's a Plug and Play analytics approach to track your application.</p><p>Parse analytics will help you to track your application and helps in management decisions to make the application a success. In this chapter, we will learn about the integration of Parse analytics along with the ways to use the data generated by those analytics.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec25"/>Integrating Parse analytics</h1></div></div></div><p>To <a id="id89" class="indexterm"/>track your application on Parse you need to plug the following code in your <code class="literal">applicationDelegate</code> file in the <code class="literal">application:didFinishLaunching:</code> method:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">[PFAnalytics trackAppOpenedWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions];</pre></div><p>By adding the preceding line of code, you can collect the data on the basis of how frequently your application is opened and what triggered it. This will also include the means by which an application is opened and the effects of push notifications.</p><p>If you pass the <code class="literal">launchOptions</code> parameter as <code class="literal">nil</code>, the application will only track the standard app opened event. In case your application is running in the background, then your <code class="literal">application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:</code> method will get invoked. In this case you need to add the following code in that method:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo {
  if (application.applicationState == UIApplicationStateActive) {
    // The application was already running.
  } else {
    // The application was just brought from the background to the foreground,
    // so we consider the app as having been "opened by a push notification."
    [PFAnalytics trackAppOpenedWithRemoteNotificationPayload:userInfo];
  }
}</pre></div><p>Once you<a id="id90" class="indexterm"/> receive push notifications for the application, your application badge is incremented, and after launching the application from the push notification, you need to clear the badges. The code to clear badges is in the following section.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec29"/>Tracking pages</h2></div></div></div><p>Parse<a id="id91" class="indexterm"/> allows you to track your application pages as well. This helps you to understand how frequently your pages are accessed by users. Parse provides you with the <code class="literal">trackEvent:</code> method to track the pages in your application. Let's say you want to track how frequently your article page is accessed. You can use the following code to track the frequency of this event:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">[PFAnalytics trackEvent:@"article_page"];</pre></div><p>There are some cases in which we need to track the page with specific data. For example, in case of searching, it's helpful to track which data is being searched the most. So for tracking the event with specific data, you can use the <code class="literal">trackEvent:dimensions:</code> method. This method accepts a dictionary as a parameter, which allows you to pass specific data while tracking the page. Let's say we want to track which article is most frequently read by users. In that case you can use the following code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">NSDictionary *dimensions = @{
  // Define the article name
  @"articleName": @"advantages of parse",
  // Provide the topic category
  @"category": @"technology",
};
// Send the dimensions to Parse along with the 'article' event
[PFAnalytics trackEvent:@"article" dimensions:dimensions]; </pre></div><p>The previous code will help you to track the event along with the custom parameters.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec30"/>Clearing all badges</h2></div></div></div><p>To clear<a id="id92" class="indexterm"/> all your badges once your application is opened, you need to set the property of the current installation to update the badge number, and ensure to update the badge value on save. To achieve all your scenarios you need to plug the following lines of code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application {
  PFInstallation *obj = [PFInstallation currentInstallation];];
  if (obj.badge != 0) {
    obj.badge = 0;
    [obj saveEventually];
  }
  // Your code here
}</pre></div><p>You can access the analytics data from your Parse application dashboard. There you will find options to filter your data as per your requirements and it will be helpful to track the application based on the tracked criteria.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec26"/>Reading analytics data</h1></div></div></div><p>Parse analytics<a id="id93" class="indexterm"/> provides you with access to various types of data analytics. You can filter your analytics data based on the following filters:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Push notifications</strong>: This filter helps you to track the push notifications that were sent by the application to the devices.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>App opens</strong>: This filter helps you to track how frequently your application is opened. You can even filter your data based on time as well. You can get the data for any particular date, month or week.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>API requests</strong>: As shown in the following screenshot you can add an <strong>API Requests</strong> filter to the application. This filter helps you to track the number of API requests that are made in a specified time slot:<div><img src="img/0333OS_04_01.jpg" alt="Reading analytics data"/></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Application platforms</strong>: This filter will help you to track the device from which the application has been <a id="id94" class="indexterm"/>accessed, such as iOS, Android, Windows, and so on.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>All classes</strong>: As shown in the following screenshot, this will filter the results based on the classes accessed in our application, and in terms of changes done in that class during our application lifecycle:<div><img src="img/0333OS_04_02.jpg" alt="Reading analytics data"/></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Request</strong>: This will filter the data based on the type of request made, such as create, get, delete, find, update and find. Based on such requests we can track which operations are performed on the application.</li></ul></div><p>After applying the filter you will have a graph, which will help you to extract how frequently<a id="id95" class="indexterm"/> the specified event had occurred:</p><div><img src="img/0333OS_04_03.jpg" alt="Reading analytics data"/></div><p>You can set the time slot for which you need to access the data. The data can be displayed in either graph format or in the bar chart format.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec27"/>Data usage</h1></div></div></div><p>Traditionally,<a id="id96" class="indexterm"/> companies have used data to forecast trends <a id="id97" class="indexterm"/>based on historical evidence. Now you have access to analytics to find the meaning behind the numbers and to differentiate the data based on the associated event. Data charts allow you to make business strategies. For example, the total time the user is spending on their application, and how a small shift can improve their outcomes. Analytics saves time by providing context to the data; this helps us to maximize productivity and prioritize tasks.</p><p>You can determine which content sources of your application are getting the most traffic once a visitor starts using the application, along with the frequency of the traffic. This information can be used to find which content is more valuable to the users of the application and will help to develop content more effectively, based on visitor preferences.</p></div>
