<em>So many different screens!</em>
</p><p>
<em>When making utility or game applications for desktop computers, you can often get away with having a particular sized window for which you can make custom graphics that exactly fit. With mobile devices, you have to cope with a wide range of screen sizes and aspect ratios and also have to interface elements that look correct for the operating system on the user's device.</em>
</p><p>LiveCode is capable of publishing on Mac, Windows, and Linux and goes some way toward solving the difficulty of making interface elements look right for each platform. The <strong>View</strong> menu has a <strong>Look and Feel</strong> menu item where you can choose between <strong>Native Theme</strong>, <strong>Mac OS Classic</strong>, <strong>Windows 95</strong>, and <strong>Motif</strong>. The same isn't true for mobile operating systems as all controls look like Motif. You still have two choices though: you can create graphics that look like they belong in your target OS, or you can call native routines in order to let the system itself present the appropriate controls.</p><p>In this chapter, we will:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Set up a <em>test bed</em> mobile application</li><li class="listitem">Open an e-mail and browser windows</li><li class="listitem">Show a date picker control</li><li class="listitem">Load pictures from the library and camera</li><li class="listitem">Make an iOS styled button</li><li class="listitem">Manually lay out an interface</li><li class="listitem">Use code to lay out an interface</li><li class="listitem">Look at a powerful mobile interface control's add-on</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec32"/>Setting up a test bed mobile app</h1></div></div></div><p>As a proving <a id="id177" class="indexterm"/>ground for the things we're going to try, we'll set up a single mobile app that has multiple screens, one for each of the things we want to test.</p><p>What should we call the test bed app? We could call it almost anything, but we'll let the iPhone make the decision for us. On the iPhone and iPod touch, there is only a small amount of space under the home screen icons for the name to appear. iOS will take your nice long app name and show a shortened version of the name, using ellipses to concatenate the ends of the name together. My super duper app will appear as My sup…app, not quite as informative! The number of letters that can appear without the text being truncated will vary depending on the width of the letters used, but typically, it has a limit of 11 letters. So, we will call the test bed app LC Test Bed, which is exactly 11 letters!</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec33"/>Time for action – making the test bed stack</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we create the <a id="id178" class="indexterm"/>iOS and Android apps, we should get what we want ready, as a LiveCode stack and fully test it on our desktop computers.

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>Well, nothing too exciting! However, you should now have five cards and the ability to go in and out of the Menu card. We're going to add scripts to each card to help illustrate its various features. The most efficient approach will be to add all the scripts and related buttons and fields and then to test the final test bed app in one go. However, where's the fun in that! Instead, we'll go one feature at a time…</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec51"/>Invoking the desktop e-mail application</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many <a id="id180" class="indexterm"/>cases where you may <a id="id181" class="indexterm"/>want to hear from the users of your applications. Perhaps, you want them to e-mail suggested improvements or to ask you questions. You could easily launch their e-mail program and leave the user to figure out what to write. Alternately, you could set the <strong>To</strong> address, <strong>Subject</strong>, and even some of the <strong>Body</strong> of the message. At the very least, it would make your life easier because you could filter incoming e-mails based on something that you placed in the Subject field.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec34"/>Time for action – calling the native e-mail application</h1></div></div></div><p>In the following <a id="id182" class="indexterm"/>steps we'll make some fields <a id="id183" class="indexterm"/>and a button to try sending an e-mail feature:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to the <strong>Email</strong> card and create four fields.

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>One neat thing about the LiveCode syntax is that the code for mobile also works for desktop applications and vice versa. All being well, when you click on the Test button, you will find yourself in your default e-mail application ready to send the message that you had entered in the LiveCode stack fields.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec53"/>Installing the e-mail test on devices</h2></div></div></div><p>It's no great <a id="id184" class="indexterm"/>surprise that the desktop test <a id="id185" class="indexterm"/>worked. The ability to open other applications is the basic feature of LiveCode. Still, it's neat to send over some initial <a id="id186" class="indexterm"/>text for the new <a id="id187" class="indexterm"/>message to take on. Next, we should check whether this works on devices too.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec35"/>Time for action – trying the test bed stack on devices</h1></div></div></div><p>Connect your <a id="id188" class="indexterm"/>Android and/or iOS device to your computer using USB. These instructions are almost the same as in the previous chapter, when we tested a "Hello World" stack. After this point, any directions will be briefer and based on the assumption that you know the steps needed to test an app on your device. <a class="link" title="Chapter 7. Deploying to Your Device" href="part0093.xhtml#aid-2OM4A2">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Deploying to Your Device</em>, describes all the options in the <strong>Standalone Applications Settings</strong> dialog. For the moment, we're only going to fill in a few details, so here, we will just view a portion of the dialog, starting with the Android settings:</p><div><img src="img/image00256.jpeg" alt="Time for action – trying the test bed stack on devices"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Make sure that <strong>Android</strong> is checked in the <strong>Standalone Application Settings</strong> dialog.</li><li class="listitem">In the <strong>Identifier</strong> field, type in an identifier that will be unique; <code class="literal">com.yourname.lctestbed</code> would do.</li><li class="listitem">Get your device to its home screen past the initial lock screen if there is one.</li><li class="listitem">In LiveCode, choose <strong>Development/Test Target</strong> and select your Android device.

At least read the parts that show you how to install your iOS developer certificates and provisioning files. As with Android, we're only going to alter a couple of items in the Standalone Application Settings. The following is the screenshot of the dialog that we'll be altering:</p><div><img src="img/image00257.jpeg" alt="Time for action – trying the test bed stack on devices"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Perform the following steps for an iOS device:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Change the <strong>Standalone Application Settings</strong> to <strong>iOS</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Under <strong>Basic Application Settings</strong> of the iOS settings is a <strong>Profile</strong> drop-down menu of the provisioning files that you have installed.

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>We went through the steps needed to install the test bed app on both Android and iOS devices. We also had to change a couple of things in the standalone application settings. As you saw, there are quite a lot of settings in there. You can look forward to learning about them all in <a class="link" title="Chapter 7. Deploying to Your Device" href="part0093.xhtml#aid-2OM4A2">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Deploying to Your Device</em>!</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec55"/>Opening a web page</h2></div></div></div><p>Another <a id="id191" class="indexterm"/>requirement in your applications is being able to present <a id="id192" class="indexterm"/>additional online information.

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>As with the Email test, adding the standard code to open a web page works for Android and iOS just as it does for a desktop computer.</p><p>If you are testing on both Android and iOS, you will notice that the behavior is different when you return after looking at a web page. With Android, you can press the back arrow button and still be on the Browser card of your stack. With iOS, the stack is restarted when you return. We will examine a solution later, where we write data to an external file, so that <a id="id194" class="indexterm"/>when the app is reopened, we can return the user before leaving the app.</p></div></div>

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>Hopefully, you're getting better and are able to build and install mobile apps faster by now! In addition to testing again on a device, we also tried out the simulator. Generally speaking, it is faster to use the iOS simulator whenever you can, and only test on a device when you're checking things such as multi-touch, accelerometer, and camera support.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec39"/>Time for action – loading pictures for a mobile device</h1></div></div></div><p>Maybe one day it will be <a id="id197" class="indexterm"/>possible for us to bring in images from the user's <a id="id198" class="indexterm"/>desktop computer photo application or from their web camera, but for now, these features only work on mobile devices.</p><p>LiveCode can call upon the native photo library and camera apps. We will test both of these on Android and iOS, but of course, only if your device has some saved images and a camera. For Kindle Fire, which doesn't have a camera, make sure that you save some pictures in the Gallery app, so that we can at least try loading those. Follow these steps to load pictures for a mobile device:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Copy the <strong>Test</strong> button from the <code class="literal">DatePicker</code> card and paste it twice on the Pictures card.

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>These simple scripts illustrate how LiveCode is able to call the OS-specific applications to do what would otherwise take a lot of coding. What's more, as later iOS and Android OS versions are released, the same simple scripts activate the more advanced features that Apple and Google will have implemented.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec59"/>Pop quiz – getting the big picture</h2></div></div></div><p>Q1. We take so much for granted when it comes to improvements in technology. You might feel hard done by if your phone's camera is a measly 2 megapixels, but think back to how things were long ago and how big a picture you were used to seeing. In terms of the number of pixels, how many original Macintosh screens can fit in the area shown by a single 8 megapixel photo?</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">4</li><li class="listitem">15</li><li class="listitem">24</li><li class="listitem">45</li></ol><div></div><p>Answer: 45!</p><p>The original Mac had a screen that was 512 x 342 pixels.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec40"/>Making OS-styled buttons</h1></div></div></div><p>It's nice that LiveCode <a id="id203" class="indexterm"/>can call upon an OS's native controls, but this raises a problem because the standard Motif-styled buttons will look ugly when used with the OS buttons.

You could get <a id="id204" class="indexterm"/>such images by taking screenshots of the buttons on your mobile device, at least with the iOS and Android OS v4 and later versions, or you can save a lot of time by downloading files that others have made available.

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>Although the button we made, may not be of the perfect size or even have the correct look for a standalone iOS button, we did go through all of the steps that you would need to make button state images. Placing a LiveCode field over the image buttons doesn't necessarily give it the best appearance. In reality, you would take more time in Photoshop to make a button of the right width for the label you're using and might also have to add the text to the image itself. It would look better and would not need a field to show the button's name in LiveCode.</p><p>LiveCode is able to use code to create the images we need, by setting the points of a graphic and its <code class="literal">fillGradient</code>. However, once you have the component parts needed to simulate a button or <a id="id213" class="indexterm"/>other kind of control, it would still take a lot more scripting to manage these elements.</p><p>There is an easy way out, although, it will cost you $50!</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec62"/>Pop quiz – the cost of things these days</h2></div></div></div><p>Q1.

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>We recreated the first two tests from our earlier test bed app, only now, it looks a lot nicer! Also, we made use of MobGUI's ability to get and set data in native iOS controls, in this case, using the <code class="literal">mgText</code> property and <code class="literal">mobileControlSet</code>.</p><p>Note that all MobGUI controls show up as <strong>groups</strong> in the LiveCode Inspector and as <strong>Custom controls</strong> in the Project Browser. These groups are made of customized LiveCode controls such as buttons, fields, and so on. MobGUI also adds a MobGUI card to the end of your stack. This card includes invisible buttons that have behaviors defined. Behaviors are methods to create <a id="id231" class="indexterm"/>common functionality between objects without duplicating the scripts. You can view these behavior scripts by clicking on the script button on the right-hand side of the Project Browser, when you display the MobGUI card. Unless you have a specific need to change these, just leave them alone.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec68"/>Have a go hero – other tests and pretty icons</h2></div></div></div><p>Go ahead and add the other two tests to the stack in the same manner as we did in the <em>Time for action</em> sections earlier in this chapter. For the <code class="literal">DatePicker</code> example, you could examine the <strong>Dictionary</strong> definition for <code class="literal">iPhonePickDate</code> to see examples of how to use the picked date data in the same manner as the previous sections for example, adjustments for different screen sizes.</p><p>So far, we have tested the size using the Portrait orientation with just an iPhone. You may want to use the same stack for iPhone and iPad or perhaps, iPad and an Android tablet, which have quite different aspect ratios.</p><p>Even if you just stick with the iPhone, you would still want to take care of Portrait and Landscape. We therefore, have to find ways to arrange the many controls on the card, so that they look their best on each screen size and orientation.</p><p>There are several ways to achieve this. First, we'll look at how to use a resize handler.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec69"/>Laying out using a resize handler</h2></div></div></div><p>When a stack's <a id="id232" class="indexterm"/>window size changes, LiveCode sends a <code class="literal">resizeStack</code> <a id="id233" class="indexterm"/>message that we can trap in order to rearrange controls for the new width and height.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec46"/>Time for action – a simple code layout example</h1></div></div></div><p>It could get <a id="id234" class="indexterm"/>quite complicated if you did lay out all of the card's controls with code, so we're only going to construct a simple case to show the technique.

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>In addition to making a simple example of how the <code class="literal">resizeStack</code> handler can be handled, we also saw that the changes in orientation also send the <code class="literal">resizeStack</code> message.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec71"/>Laying out using the LiveCode Geometry Manager</h2></div></div></div><p>While a control <a id="id236" class="indexterm"/>is selected on the card, the Inspector <a id="id237" class="indexterm"/>palette has an entry named Geometry. It's a somewhat strange interface! Let's take a look:</p><div><img src="img/image00264.jpeg" alt="Laying out using the LiveCode Geometry Manager"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>These faint horizontal and vertical bars are used to select whether you want the control to be scaled or positioned by a fixed amount or relative amount. That is, if a button is 100 pixels from the right of the card window and if you select the position a fixed amount away, then as you resize the card window, the button will remain 100 pixels away from the right edge of the window. If, on the other hand, you use the relative setting and the button is 80 percent across the card window, it will still be 80 percent across the window after you have resized it.</p><p>The first click <a id="id238" class="indexterm"/>on one of these bars will make it <a id="id239" class="indexterm"/>turn solid red in color and this indicates that it's a fixed amount away from the edge of the card. If you click on it again, it takes the shape of a red waveform, indicating that it's going to be relative.</p><p>In the screenshot, you can see that the selected button is set to a fixed amount from the bottom of the card and a relative amount from the right of the card. The image also shows the scaling settings for the control.</p><p>Note that an <a id="id240" class="indexterm"/>object can also be positioned relative <a id="id241" class="indexterm"/>to other objects. Refer to the <strong>Right object</strong> and <strong>Bottom object</strong> pop-up selectors in the preceding screenshot.</p></div></div>

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>That was quite a quick test, and if all went well, you will see that resizing the card window includes positioning the first four buttons using the <code class="literal">resizeStack</code> handler that we added, and it's positioning of the second set of four buttons using the Geometry Manager. With the settings we used, the results should be much the same, except that the second set of four buttons will remain a fixed distance away from the bottom of the card window.</p><p>There is a lot of power in the Geometry Manager and you should take a look at the other abilities it has at the reference link shown at the end of this chapter. However, it is not the best way to deal with mobile screen sizes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec48"/>Resolution independence</h1></div></div></div><p>LiveCode 6.5, and beyond…</p><p>One of the features <a id="id244" class="indexterm"/>listed in <a class="link" title="Chapter 1. LiveCode Fundamentals" href="part0016.xhtml#aid-F8901">Chapter 1</a>, <em>LiveCode Fundamentals</em>, has already been developed and is present in LiveCode 6.5. The new feature is Resolution Independence.</p><p>Now, after seeing the two complex ways of adjusting the screen size, you may be able to forget all of it. In LiveCode 6.5, a new feature called Resolution Independence was introduced, and the correct use of this feature will make many of the layout difficulties go away.</p><p>There are two approaches in place to help you deal with different device sizes and aspect ratios: the Multiple Density <a id="id245" class="indexterm"/>Support and the Full Screen Scaling Mode. Some of the concepts are a little tricky, but a few screenshots will hopefully make them clear!</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec73"/>Multiple density support</h2></div></div></div><p>So far in this <a id="id246" class="indexterm"/>chapter, we overlooked the issue of the <strong>DPI</strong> (<strong>dots per inch</strong>) of devices. For Android devices, there are hundreds of different resolutions and DPI values. With iOS, there are only a few variations of DPI and resolution. The simplest these problem cases to examine, is where you want the same app to look like and work in the same manner as iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 Retina or later versions of iPhones. Both have the same size screen, but iPhone 4's retina display has <a id="id247" class="indexterm"/>twice the DPI. This URL shows you the difference between all the current iPhones: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.paintcodeapp.com/news/ultimate-guide-to-iphone-resolutions">http://www.paintcodeapp.com/news/ultimate-guide-to-iphone-resolutions</a>.</p><p>With the MobGUI and Geometry Manager solution, you are effectively storing layout values or instructions behind the scenes that are ready to adapt to the user's device screen size. The Multiple Density Support in LiveCode 6.5 is an easier way to solve this issue.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec04"/>Pixels and points</h3></div></div></div><p>A pixel is <a id="id248" class="indexterm"/>an illuminated dot in an image or of a screen, whereas a point is a unit of measurement in print, generally, 1/72nd of an inch. If a screen has exactly 72 DPI, the two would be the same, and in the earlier days of Macintosh computers, this was pretty much the case. More modern Macs and PCs and most mobile devices are a lot more detailed than 72 DPI. With <a id="id249" class="indexterm"/>LiveCode 6.5, and its later versions, you can now make a stack that works in points, that will then fill the device screen by taking the image of each card and by applying a scaling factor to it.</p><p>While doing such scaling, something must be assumed to be of natural size. For iOS, LiveCode uses non-Retina screens as a scale factor of 1X and Retina screens are a scale factor of 2X. iPhone 5 and 6 introduced more sizes. A scale factor of 3X is required for iPhone 6 Plus. With Android, things are more complicated as it has at least seven levels of scaling factor.</p><p>In fact, really, there are an infinite number of scaling factors going on behind the scenes. However, you generally don't have to worry about them because LiveCode automatically gives you the <a id="id250" class="indexterm"/>ability to show <a id="id251" class="indexterm"/>different versions of an image depending on the DPI of the device in question.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec05"/>Image naming convention</h3></div></div></div><p>LiveCode <a id="id252" class="indexterm"/>will look at the file names of the included images (that have been added in the <strong>Copy Files</strong> part of the <strong>Standalone Application Settings</strong> dialog) and will load in the appropriately named version of the image. In the example shown here, two images have been added, <code class="literal">icon.png</code> and <code class="literal">icon@2x.png</code>. To make it easier to spot which one you are seeing, 512 and 1024 have been added to what would otherwise be two resolutions of the same icon:</p><div><img src="img/image00265.jpeg" alt="Image naming convention"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>This image is slightly magnified here to help you see that the 512 version of the image is lower resolution than the 1024 version.</p><p>The names used for iOS are:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">imagename.ext</code> (for example, <code class="literal">flowers.png</code>)</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">imagename@2x.ext</code> (for example, <code class="literal">flowers@2x.png</code>)</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">imagename@3x.ext</code> (for example, <code class="literal">flowers@3x.png</code>) for iPhone 6 Plus</li></ul></div><p>The first one is considered as the 1X scaled version and the <code class="literal">@2x</code> name is considered as the 2X scaled version and the same goes for the <code class="literal">@3x</code> version.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"/>Note</h3><p>Note that you also need to specify the appropriate <strong>Splash Screen</strong> files in the LiveCode <strong>Standalone Application Settings</strong>. Otherwise, the iPhone will use lower resolution images. This can be verified by examining the <code class="literal">screenRect</code> of the device. Even <a id="id253" class="indexterm"/>though iPhone 6 Plus has a physical resolution of 1080 x 1920, use the 3x image sizes of 1242 x 2208. The phone automatically downsizes the image. 2x images will be displayed fine on iPhone 6.</p></div><p>The names and scaling factors used for Android are more varied:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">imagename@ultra-low.ext - 0.25X</code></li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">imagename extra-low.ext - 0.5X</code></li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">imagename low.ext - 0.75</code></li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">imagename medium.ext - 1X</code></li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">imagename high.ext - 1.5X</code></li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">imagename@extra-high.ext - 2x</code></li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">imagename@ultra-high.ext - 4x</code></li></ul></div><p>In actual practice, you may find that you only need two or three versions of an image to make an image look good enough on a wide range of DPI devices.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec74"/>The full-screen scaling mode</h2></div></div></div><p>Prior to <a id="id254" class="indexterm"/>LiveCode 6.5 and its <a id="id255" class="indexterm"/>multiple density support, you had to do all the hard work by yourself! At least now you can design for just iPhone or iPad and have Retina versions of these devices looked after by LiveCode. With Android though, you still need to have a variety of layouts or alternately, have code that would position the interface elements based on the aspect ratio and pixel dimensions of the device.</p><p>With the density support, you only have to take care of the aspect ratio, but there are still a lot of these to be taken care of. For utility-like applications, you will most likely have to go to this trouble, so that users get the expected experience. However, there are many types of applications that are more graphical and that can take advantage of the full screen scaling modes: <code class="literal">empty</code>, <code class="literal">exactFit</code>, <code class="literal">showAll</code>, <code class="literal">noBorder</code>, and <code class="literal">noScale</code>. Let's take a look at what these are…</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec06"/>Syntax</h3></div></div></div><p>The general <a id="id256" class="indexterm"/>syntax, by the way, is to type this in your stack script:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">on preopenstack
  set the fullscreenmode of the current stack to "showAll"
end preopenstack</pre></div><p>The quotes are required for the four active modes. The empty mode does not need quotes.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec07"/>The empty mode</h3></div></div></div><p>If <strong>fullscreenmode</strong> is <a id="id257" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>empty</strong>, the card area is changed to match the device screen. That is, the top left card is in the top-left corner of the device screen and the card width and height match the actual pixel width and height of the device. Well, except if you have taken advantage of the multiple density support discussed earlier! Essentially, empty is the existing behavior in the earlier versions of LiveCode.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec08"/>The showAll mode</h3></div></div></div><p>This mode arrived <a id="id258" class="indexterm"/>slightly later than the other modes and is present in LiveCode 6.6 and its later versions. With <strong>showAll</strong>, as the <code class="literal">fullscreenmode</code>, the card's contents will be scaled, so that all of it is within the device's screen. For devices that have a different aspect ratio than your card, elements that were outside of the card area are revealed. Suppose you create a graphical book app where you want the full height of the card to exactly fill the height of the device screen, but you don't want black bars down the sides on a wider device, then you could extend the background pattern beyond the left- and right-hand side of the card area. On a narrower device, such as iPad, you would see the 4:3 area of the card. On a wider device, say iPhone 5, the extra background would be revealed. The following illustration shows which area of the background image will be seen on different devices:</p><div><img src="img/image00266.jpeg" alt="The showAll mode"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec09"/>The letterbox mode</h3></div></div></div><p>The <strong>letterbox</strong> <a id="id259" class="indexterm"/>mode is identical to <strong>showAll</strong> except that the areas beyond the card area are hidden and leave you with the typical movie letterbox effect, hence the name!</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec10"/>The noBorder mode</h3></div></div></div><p>The <strong>noBorder</strong> <a id="id260" class="indexterm"/>mode is very useful, but takes some time to get used to. Let's say you are making a graphical adventure game, along the lines of Myst, and you want to use the same graphics for all devices. You could create a scene that has an aspect ratio of 14:9 and make sure that the important content is not too close to the edges. When the scene is viewed in the <code class="literal">noBorder</code> mode on an iPad, you would see the full height of the scene and most of the width. When viewed on iPhone 5, you would see the full width of the scene and most of the height. As the name suggests, the card area would be scaled, so that there are no borders, as there would be in the letterbox mode. The following illustration shows which areas of an original 14:9 photograph would be visible for a 4:3 iPad and a 16:9 iPhone:</p><div><img src="img/image00267.jpeg" alt="The noBorder mode"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec11"/>The exactFit mode</h3></div></div></div><p>As the name <a id="id261" class="indexterm"/>implies, <strong>exactFit</strong> would take the card's content and squish it to fill the device's screen. It's hard to think of a use case for this mode, but perhaps, if you perform some sort of artistic visualizer, the squishing wouldn't matter much!</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note08"/>Note</h3><p>As mentioned <a id="id262" class="indexterm"/>previously, the Geometry Manager has a lot of powerful features.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec49"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>The trick with easy-to-use tools, such as LiveCode, is to create mobile apps that users think were created with the hard-to-use native tools, such as Xcode. You can achieve this because of LiveCode's ability to call upon native features and because you can make interfaces that look appropriate.</p><p>In this chapter, we covered several ways to achieve this goal by calling native OS features using simple LiveCode commands. We prepared images to be used for button states and made buttons that look OS-specific by adding these images. We also created controls that look like iOS native controls with MobGUI and laid out the interface with code, with the Geometry Manager.</p><p>So far, these have all been small test stacks to get us warmed up! Next, we're going to look at the general application structure to make a fully fleshed out utility application.</p></div></body></html>
