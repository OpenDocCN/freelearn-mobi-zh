Now, you will learn about tools available in Android Studio that make your life easier. Have you wondered how to manage the Android platforms? Do you want to have your project clearly documented? Are you working as a group of developers and need a version control manager integrated with Android Studio?</p><p>This chapter describes the most important additional tools provided in Android Studio: Android SDK tools, Javadoc, and version control integration. First, you will learn about the SDK Manager available in Android Studio from which you'll be able to examine, update, and<a class="indexterm" id="id227"/> install different components for our project. Next, we will review the <strong>Android Virtual Device</strong> (<strong>AVD</strong>) Manager, where we can edit the virtual devices in which we will be testing our project. You will also learn how to have complete documentation using the Javadoc tool, how to have version control using the systems available in Android Studio, and how to handle your project tasks.</p><p>These are the topics we'll be covering in this chapter:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">SDK Manager</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">AVD Manager</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Javadoc</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Version control</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Tasks and contexts</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec35"/>Software Development Kit Manager</h1></div></div></div><p>The SDK Manager is<a class="indexterm" id="id228"/> an Android tool accessible from Android Studio to control our Android SDK installation. From this tool, we can examine the Android platforms installed in our system, update them, install new platforms, or install some other components such as Google Play services or Android Support Library.</p><p>To open the <a class="indexterm" id="id229"/>SDK Manager from Android Studio, navigate to <strong>Tools</strong> | <strong>Android</strong> | <strong>SDK Manager</strong>. You can also click on the shortcut from the toolbar. The SDK Manager is an independent Android tool that has been integrated in Android Studio default settings at <strong>Appearance &amp; Behavior</strong> | <strong>System Settings</strong> | <strong>Android SDK</strong>, as shown in the next screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Software Development Kit Manager" src="img/B05459_06_01.jpg"/></div><p>The SDK path configured in Android Studio is displayed at the top of the manager. You can change its path by clicking on the <strong>Edit</strong> button. The SDK Manager displays the list of available <strong>SDK Platforms</strong> packages with the following properties:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Name</strong>: This is the name of the container that aggregates related packages. Check the <strong>Show Package Details</strong> checkbox under the list of packages to see the details of the container.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>API level</strong>: This is the API number in which the package was added.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Revision</strong>: This is the package revision or version.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Status</strong>: This is the status of the package on your system. The status can be <em>Not installed</em>, <em>Installed</em>, <em>Update available</em>, <em>Not compatible</em>, or <em>Obsolete</em>. If the <strong>Show Package Details</strong> checkbox is unchecked, then the status can also be <em>Partially installed</em>. With <strong>Show Package Details</strong> unchecked, a container package is considered <em>Installed</em> when both the <strong>SDK Platform</strong> and <strong>Sources for Android SDK</strong> packages are installed. If there is only one of these packages installed, the container package status is <em>Partially installed</em>.</li></ul></div><p>In the SDK Tools tab, you can manage the available SDK developer tools such as <strong>Android SDK Platform-tools</strong>, <strong>Android Support Library</strong>, or <strong>Google Play services</strong>, which will be explained in <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Google Play Services">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Google Play Services</em>.</p><p>In the <strong>SDK Update Sites</strong> tab, we can examine the list of official sites that provide add-ons and extra packages. We can add our custom external sites using the <strong>Add</strong> button at the bottom of the list.</p><p>Click on <a class="indexterm" id="id230"/>the <strong>Launch Standalone SDK Manager</strong> button at the bottom of the screen to open the standalone SDK Manager. This manager was the only option available in old versions of Android Studio. From the standalone SDK Manager, the SDK platforms and tools are listed like in the integrated SDK Manager, but we can also find some more options to filter and select the packages.</p><p>The packages can be filtered by their state using the checkboxes under the list. These options are also accessible from the <strong>Packages</strong> menu at the top.</p><p>Next to the name of the packages, there is a checkbox to select the packages we want to install, update, or delete. As shown in the next screenshot, the packages that are installed in our system and also have an update available are checked by default:</p><div><img alt="Software Development Kit Manager" src="img/B05459_06_02.jpg"/></div><p>If there is a new Android platform version that is not installed, its packages will also be checked, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="Software Development Kit Manager" src="img/B05459_06_03.jpg"/></div><p>The total number of selected packages to be installed or updated is indicated in the text of the<a class="indexterm" id="id231"/> button at the bottom of the dialog. The button under it indicates the total number of selected packages to be deleted. You can delete packages that are deprecated or packages that you do not need anymore.</p><p>Check the packages that need to be updated and also check the last Android platform. In addition, you should check the minimum platform supported by our application (Android 4.1.2, API 16) to be able to test our application in a virtual device using this version. Click on the <strong>Install</strong> button.</p><p>In the next dialog, we have to accept the package licenses. Check the <strong>Accept License</strong> radio button and click on the <strong>Install</strong> button. The installation or update of the packages will start showing its progress. First, the manager downloads the packages, then it unzips them, and, finally, it installs them.</p><p>Remember to check the SDK Manager from time to time for updates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec36"/>The AVD Manager</h1></div></div></div><p>The <strong>AVD Manager</strong> is an Android tool accessible from Android Studio to manage the Android virtual devices that will be executed in the Android emulator.</p><p>To open the <a class="indexterm" id="id232"/>AVD Manager from Android Studio, navigate to <strong>Tools</strong> | <strong>Android</strong> | <strong>AVD Manager</strong>. You can also click on the shortcut from the toolbar. The AVD Manager displays the list of the existing virtual devices. Since we have not created any virtual devices, the list will initially be empty. To create our first virtual device, click on the <strong>Create Virtual Device</strong> button to open the configuration dialog.</p><p>The first step is<a class="indexterm" id="id233"/> to select the hardware configuration of the virtual device. The device definitions are listed on the left-hand side of the window. Device definitions can be classified into one of these categories: <strong>Phone</strong>, <strong>Tablet</strong>, <strong>Wear</strong>, or <strong>TV</strong>. Select one of them in the <strong>Phone</strong> category, such as Nexus 6, to examine its details on the right-hand side, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="The AVD Manager" src="img/B05459_06_04.jpg"/></div><p>We can also <a class="indexterm" id="id234"/>configure our own hardware device definitions from the AVD Manager. We can create a new definition using the <strong>New Hardware Profile</strong> button. The <strong>Clone Device…</strong> button creates a duplicate of an existing device.</p><p>Click on the <strong>New Hardware Profile</strong> button to examine the existing configuration parameters. The parameters that define a device are:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Device Name</strong>: This is the name of the device.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Device Type</strong>: This is the device type, which can be a <strong>Phone/Tablet</strong>, <strong>Android Wear</strong>, or <strong>Android TV</strong>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Screensize</strong>: This is screen size in inches.

Name it <code class="literal">My Device</code>. Then, click on the <strong>Finish</strong> button. The hardware definition has been added to the list of configurations. If you right-click on the new hardware profile, you can edit it, clone it, export it, or delete it. Hardware profiles are exported using a XML format.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Next</strong> button to continue the creation of a new virtual device. The next step is to select the virtual device system image and the target Android platform. Each platform has its own architecture. The system images are listed on the left-hand panel and the details of a selected system image are shown in the right-hand panel. If a <strong>Recommendation</strong> message appears in the detail panel as shown in the next screenshot, follow the recommendation and select a different image.</p><div><img alt="The AVD Manager" src="img/B05459_06_07.jpg"/></div><p>Along <a class="indexterm" id="id237"/>with <strong>Release Name</strong> of a system image, there is a <strong>Download</strong> button. Select one of the <strong>Recommended</strong> images of the Marshmallow (API level 23) release with Google APIs and click on the <strong>Download</strong> button. Wait until the installation is finished and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><p>The last step is to verify the configuration of the virtual device. Enter the name of the AVD in the <strong>AVD Name</strong> field. Give the virtual device a meaningful name to recognize it easily, such as <code class="literal">AVD_nexus6_api23</code>. Click on the <strong>Show Advanced Settings</strong> button. The settings that we can configure for the virtual device are the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Startup size and orientation</strong>: Select a scale for the screen and the initial orientation of the device. We recommend selecting the <strong>Auto</strong> scale.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Camera</strong>: Select this if the emulator has a front camera or a back camera.

In Android Studio, open the main layout with the graphical editor and click on the list of the devices. As the following screenshot shows, our custom device definition<a class="indexterm" id="id239"/> appears and we can select it to preview the layout:</p><div><img alt="The AVD Manager" src="img/B05459_06_09.jpg"/></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec20"/>The Android emulator</h2></div></div></div><p>Now <a class="indexterm" id="id240"/>that we have one AVD<a class="indexterm" id="id241"/> created in the AVD Manager, we can run it on the Android <a class="indexterm" id="id242"/>emulator. Open the AVD Manager and click on the <strong>Start</strong> button of the AVD. The emulator will be opened, as shown in the next screenshot. Wait until it is completely loaded and then you will be able to try it.</p><div><img alt="The Android emulator" src="img/B05459_06_10.jpg"/></div><p>Next to<a class="indexterm" id="id243"/> the emulator, to its right-hand side, there is a bar with actions: power button, volume up and down, rotate left and right, take screenshot, zoom, back button, home button, overview button, and the extended controls.</p><p>Click on the <strong>More</strong> option to open the next extended controls:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Location</strong>: This<a class="indexterm" id="id244"/> emulates the location of the device by setting latitude, longitude, and altitude. You can also emulate a series of location changes. Unfortunately, no map is provided to easily select a location, but you can use Google Maps to get the latitude and longitude of the locations you want to emulate. This mechanism is useful if your app displays a map or depends on the user's location to trigger a specific action. To try this feature, open the Google Maps app on the virtual device. Enter some coordinates in the <strong>Extended controls</strong> and click on <strong>SEND</strong>. Observe how Google Maps draws your location in the one you entered as<a class="indexterm" id="id245"/> the following screenshot shows:<div><img alt="The Android emulator" src="img/B05459_06_11.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Cellular</strong>: This emulates the speed of the network (<strong>Full</strong>, <strong>HSDAP</strong>, <strong>UMTS</strong>, and so on). This<a class="indexterm" id="id246"/> also <a class="indexterm" id="id247"/>emulates <strong>Data status</strong> and <strong>Voice status</strong>. This mechanism is useful, if your app depends on external data, to examine how it works with slow network connections. Try this feature by changing the <strong>Network type</strong> to <strong>EDGE</strong> and note how it changes in the emulator:<div><img alt="The Android emulator" src="img/B05459_06_12.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Battery</strong>: This emulates the battery charge level, if the device is connected to a charger, the battery health, or the battery status. This mechanism is useful if your app<a class="indexterm" id="id248"/> changes<a class="indexterm" id="id249"/> its behavior depending on the battery status. For example, if the battery level is low, you can avoid unnecessary network requests to reduce battery consumption. If you change the <strong>Charge level</strong> to <strong>10%</strong> and the <strong>Charger connection</strong> to <strong>None</strong>, the emulator displays a low battery notification:<div><img alt="The Android emulator" src="img/B05459_06_13.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Phone</strong>: This emulates a phone call or a SMS message. This mechanism is useful, for example, to examine how your app recovers from interruptions. To try this feature, click on the <strong>CALL DEVICE</strong> button and see how the device <a class="indexterm" id="id250"/>receives<a class="indexterm" id="id251"/> the call, as the next screenshot shows:<div><img alt="The Android emulator" src="img/B05459_06_14.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Directional pad</strong>: This<a class="indexterm" id="id252"/> emulates a directional pad.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Fingerprint</strong>: This emulates a finger touching the fingerprint sensor. This mechanism is<a class="indexterm" id="id253"/> useful if your app has a fingerprint security step, for example, to make a payment. To try this feature, open the Android <strong>Settings</strong> in the virtual device, go to <strong>Security</strong>, and click on <strong>Fingerprint</strong>. Follow the steps to add a fingerprint. You will get to the step, shown in the next screenshot, in which you need put your finger on the sensor:<div><img alt="The Android emulator" src="img/B05459_06_15.jpg"/></div><p>Click<a class="indexterm" id="id254"/> on the <strong>TOUCH SENSOR</strong> button from the <strong>Extended controls</strong>. The fingerprint will be added as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="The Android emulator" src="img/B05459_06_16.jpg"/></div><p>Click on the power button to lock the device and click it again to unlock it. The fingerprint is then required. Click on the <strong>TOUCH SENSOR</strong> button using the same fingerprint and the device will be unlocked.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Settings</strong>: These <a class="indexterm" id="id255"/>are the settings of the emulator. For example, you can change the folder to save <a class="indexterm" id="id256"/>the screenshots or if you want to send crash reports.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Help</strong>: This <a class="indexterm" id="id257"/>contains <strong>Keyboard shortcuts</strong>, <strong>Emulator help</strong>, and <strong>About</strong>.</li></ul></div><p>Finally, if you selected an emulated camera when you created the device definition, you can test it by opening the camera app in the emulator. Open it and note how a random video appears as if the camera was capturing it:</p><div><img alt="The Android emulator" src="img/B05459_06_17.jpg"/></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec37"/>Generating Javadoc</h1></div></div></div><p>Javadoc is <a class="indexterm" id="id258"/>a utility to document Java code in HTML format. The Javadoc documentation is generated from comments and tags added to Java classes or methods. The comments start with the <code class="literal">/**</code> string and end with <code class="literal">*/</code>. Inside these comments, tags can be added. The following tags, in the same order as they should be added, are available in Javadoc:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">@author</code>: This<a class="indexterm" id="id259"/> indicates the author or authors of the code.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">@version</code>: This <a class="indexterm" id="id260"/>indicates the version of the class or method. Used for classes and interfaces.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">@param</code>: This <a class="indexterm" id="id261"/>describes a method parameter. Only used in methods and constructors.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">@return</code>: This <a class="indexterm" id="id262"/>describes the return object of a method. Only used in methods that do not return <code class="literal">void</code>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">@throws</code>: This<a class="indexterm" id="id263"/> describes an exception that can be thrown by the method.

We can use code completion when typing Javadoc comments. Javadoc documentation will appear in the pop-up tool tips of the code elements.</p><p>To generate a complete Javadoc, we have to write the Javadoc comments about our classes and methods. Open the main activity of our project to add the Javadoc comments to the <code class="literal">onAcceptClick</code> method we created in <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Creating User Interfaces">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Creating User Interfaces</em>. Place the caret on the line before the method declaration, type <code class="literal">/**</code>, and press <em>Enter</em>. The Javadoc comments are automatically inserted containing the available information from the method declaration: parameters and return type. In this case, there is no return type, so the automatically generated Javadoc is the following:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">/**
 * 
 * @param v
 */</pre></div><p>The first line of the documentation comments is the method description. Then, it explains each parameter and the return type. The method should now look like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">/**

public void onAcceptClick(View v) { ... }</pre></div><p>This information about the method will now be displayed as its documentation in the emerging dialogs. The<a class="indexterm" id="id268"/> following screenshot shows the dialog that should appear over the method:</p><div><img alt="Generating Javadoc" src="img/B05459_06_18.jpg"/></div><p>To generate the Javadoc documentation, navigate to <strong>Tools</strong> | <strong>Generate Javadoc...</strong>. A dialog showing the Javadoc options will be opened. We can select the scope, if we want to include test or library sources, the output directory, and the visibility of the included elements. Related to the format of documentation, we can create a hierarchy tree, a navigation bar, and an index if needed.</p><p>Check <strong>Current File</strong> as scope to generate just the documentation of our main activity. Select an output directory from your system. Reduce the visibility to <strong>public</strong> and click on the <strong>OK</strong> button. The Javadoc documentation in HTML format has been created in the output directory. The <code class="literal">index.html</code> file is the start point. Open the <code class="literal">index.html</code> file and navigate through the documentation to open the <code class="literal">MyActivity</code> class, like in the following screenshot. Note that the <code class="literal">onCreate</code> method, whose visibility is protected, does not appear, as we reduced the visibility of the generated Javadoc to <strong>public</strong> elements.</p><div><img alt="Generating Javadoc" src="img/B05459_06_19.jpg"/></div></div>

An issue tracking system is a software<a class="indexterm" id="id269"/> tool that manages lists of issues. Some issue tracking systems supported by Android Studio are the following: Jira, YouTrack, Lighthouse, Mantis, Trello, or Bugzilla.</p><p>To integrate<a class="indexterm" id="id270"/> one of these tracking systems into your project using Android <a class="indexterm" id="id271"/>Studio, navigate to <strong>Tools</strong> | <strong>Tasks &amp; Contexts</strong> | <strong>Configure Servers...</strong>. Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button and select one of the available systems. You need to enter the server URL, the authentication values, and some additional parameters depending on the system type.</p><p>From the <strong>Tasks &amp; Contexts</strong> menu you will find the actions to manage the tasks, such as switching among tasks, creating a new task, closing the current task, or editing the current task.</p><p>A task is identified by its name and is usually attached to an issue in your issue tracking system. A task can also be associated with a context, which defines a set of files that will be opened in the editor when you work on it. You can create, load, or clear a context from the <strong>Tasks &amp; Contexts</strong> menu.</p><p>Let's create a task. Navigate to <strong>Tools</strong> | <strong>Tasks &amp; Contexts</strong> | <strong>+ Open Task...</strong>. Type the name, for example, <code class="literal">My first task</code>, and click on <strong>Create New Task 'My first task'</strong>.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec39"/>Version control systems</h1></div></div></div><p>Android Studio<a class="indexterm" id="id274"/> integrates some <strong>version control systems</strong> (<strong>VCS</strong>): GitHub, CVS, Git, Google Cloud, Mercurial, and Subversion. To enable version control integration, navigate to <strong>VCS</strong> | <strong>Enable Version Control Integration...</strong> and select the type of system. Now, some more options will be added to the <strong>VCS</strong> menu:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">To update the entire project, navigate to <strong>VCS</strong> | <strong>Update Project...</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">To commit all the changes to the project, navigate to <strong>VCS</strong> | <strong>Commit Changes...</strong></li></ul></div><p>The first step is to do the checkout from the version control system. Navigate to <strong>VCS</strong> | <strong>Checkout from Version Control</strong>, click on the add icon, and type the repository URL or the repository configuration.</p><p>The version control actions can also be applied to individual files. Right-click on any file of the project and select the <strong>Subversion</strong> section. From the emerging menu, we can add the file to the <a class="indexterm" id="id275"/>repository, add it to the ignore list, browse the changes, revert the changes, or lock it.</p><p>A simpler way to control the file versions is using the <strong>Local History</strong> option. Open the main activity file in the editor and navigate to <strong>VCS</strong> | <strong>Local History</strong> | <strong>Show History</strong>. The file history dialog will be opened. On the left-hand side of the dialog, the available versions of the file are listed. Select an older version to compare it to the current version of the file. The differences between the older version and the current version are highlighted. Gray color is used to indicate a block of deleted code, blue color to highlight the text that has changed, and green color to indicate the newly inserted text. From the top icons, we can revert the changes and configure the whitespaces visualization. The following screenshot shows the comparison between two versions of our main activity. We can observe how the method we recently added—the <code class="literal">onAcceptClick</code> method—is highlighted in green:</p><div><img alt="Version control systems" src="img/B05459_06_22.jpg"/></div><p>We can also examine the local history of a specific block of code. Close the dialog, select some lines of code from the editor, and navigate to <strong>VCS</strong> | <strong>Local History</strong> | <strong>Show History for Selection</strong>. The same history dialog will be opened, but, this time, it displays the versions of the selected code.</p></div>

You can create a new AVD and edit it whenever necessary. Creating complete documentation for our project should no longer be a problem using Javadoc and we should also be able to work with a VCS integrated in Android Studio.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn about the available Google Play services and how to integrate them with your project using Android Studio. We will also see how to install and integrate different libraries available with Google technology, such as Google Maps, Google Cloud Messaging, and more.</p></div></body></html>
