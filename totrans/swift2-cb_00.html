Apple has introduced Swift 2 along with some great new features and benefits to Xcode and underlying technologies. This book is intended to update Objective-C developers who want to migrate to Swift 2 and also to help Swift developers get a stronger base with better knowledge of this programming language and its second version.</p><p class="calibre7">If you enjoy creating small apps, this book is perfect for you. It will show you how to create Swift apps from scratch. So, take your Mac, open your Xcode, and let's cook Swift!</p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03" class="calibre1"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Developing with Swift 2 requires Xcode 7 or higher, which by itself needs to be installed on Yosemite (OS X 10.10). This can only be installed on a Mac computer. So, this is basically what you need.</p><p class="calibre7">A few recipes can only be tested on a physical device (iPhone, iPad, or iPod); therefore, they can only be installed if you are enrolled on the Apple Developer Program.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04" class="calibre1"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7"> If you are an experienced Objective-C programmer and are looking for quick solutions to many different coding tasks in Swift, then this book is for you. You are expected to have development experience, though not necessarily with Swift.</p></div>
