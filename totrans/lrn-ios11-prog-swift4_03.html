            <h1 class="header-title">Building on the Swift Foundation</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>In the last chapter, we went through the basics of understanding data types and how
               to create variables and constants. Now that we are comfortable with those topics,
               let's look at adding more building blocks. This chapter will build on what we learned
               in the last chapter and get a bit closer to better understanding Swift.
            </p>
            
            <p>The following will be covered in this chapter:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Type safety and type inference</li>
               
               <li>Operations with Integers</li>
               
               <li><kbd>if</kbd> statements
               </li>
               
               <li>Optionals and optional bindings</li>
               
               <li>Functions</li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Data types are good, but we will need to add some logic to our app. For example, we
               want to be able to control whether someone should see a login screen when they launch
               the app or if they should go right into the app. You will use logic a lot, so let's
               look at what an <kbd>if</kbd> statement is and how to use it.

            <p>As you learned earlier, launch Xcode and click on <span class="packt_screen">Get started with a playground</span>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/10e726df-ec5e-4fee-9f85-aae4267c1206.png"/></div>
            
            <p>The Playground template screen will appear. Make sure that you select <span class="packt_screen">iOS</span> and then choose <span class="packt_screen">Blank</span> and hit <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>. You will be asked to give your project a name and a location to save the file; name
               your new Playground <kbd>iOS11-Programming-for-Beginners-Ch3</kbd>. You can save the file anywhere that you like. Now, with the project saved, we can
               explore Playgrounds a bit.

            <h1 class="header-title">The if statements – having fun with logic statements</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Let's add our first piece of logic using an <kbd>if</kbd> statement. An <kbd>if</kbd> statement is a simple statement to determine whether or not a statement is true.
               Input the following into Xcode:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/8aaccd7a-41ae-4f3f-aa46-bbe702bcb1e8.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In the first line of the preceding code, we created a constant named, <kbd>isPictureVisible</kbd>, and we set it to <kbd>true</kbd>. The next line starts our <kbd>if</kbd> statement and is read as follows: if <kbd>isPictureVisible</kbd> is <kbd>true</kbd>, then print <kbd>Picture is visible</kbd>. When we write <kbd>if</kbd> statements, we must use the curly braces to enclose our logic. It is good practice
               to put the opening curly brace (<kbd>{</kbd>) on the same line as the <kbd>if</kbd> and the closing curly brace (<kbd>}</kbd>) on the line immediately after your logic.
            </p>
            
            <p>When writing <kbd>if</kbd> statements using a <kbd>bool</kbd>, you are always checking for <kbd>true</kbd>; however, if you wanted to check for <kbd>false</kbd>, you would do the following:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/6da505b5-89ac-4290-ba5d-a7c57852e606.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Bools work great with <kbd>if</kbd> statements, but we also can use them with other data types. Let's try an <kbd>if</kbd> statement with an <kbd>Int</kbd> next. Write the following into Playgrounds:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/b8112d3b-7dae-4167-a501-520c5789b361.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In the preceding example, we first created another constant with our <kbd>Int</kbd> set to <kbd>19</kbd>. The next line says—if <kbd>drinkingAgeLimit</kbd> is less than <kbd>21</kbd>, then print <kbd>Since we cannot offer you an adult beverage - would you like a water or soda to drink?</kbd> When you are using <kbd>Int</kbd> within <kbd>if</kbd> statements, you will use the comparison operators (<kbd>&lt;</kbd>, <kbd>&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>&lt;=</kbd>, <kbd>&gt;=</kbd>, <kbd>==</kbd>, or <kbd>!=</kbd>). However, our last <kbd>if</kbd> statement feels incomplete, because we are not doing anything for someone over <kbd>21</kbd>. This is where you will utilize an <kbd>if...else</kbd> statement. You enter an <kbd>if...else</kbd> statement exactly as you did an <kbd>if</kbd> statement, but, at the end, you add the word else.
            </p>
            
            <p>You can add else to both of the <kbd>if</kbd> statements we have inputted so far, but, for now, just add it to the end of our last
               <kbd>if</kbd> statement:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/b698287d-0910-43ef-b95b-8621a055e07d.png"/></div>
            
            <p>With else added onto the end of our <kbd>if</kbd> statement, it turns into an <kbd>if...else</kbd> statement, which now reads—if <kbd>drinkingAgeLimit</kbd> is less than <kbd>21</kbd>, then print <kbd>Since we cannot offer you an adult beverage - would you like a water or soda to drink?</kbd> Otherwise (or <kbd>else</kbd>), print <kbd>What type of beverage would you like? We have adult beverages along with water or
                  soda to drink</kbd>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Now, our <kbd>if...else</kbd> statement can handle both conditions. Based on the value <kbd>19</kbd> for our <kbd>drinkingAgeLimit</kbd>, we can see in the Debug panel: <kbd>Since we cannot offer you an adult beverage - would you like a water or soda to drink?</kbd> If we change <kbd>drinkingAgeLimit</kbd> to <kbd>30</kbd>, our Debug panel says, <kbd>What type of beverage would you like? We have adult beverages along with water or
                  soda to drink</kbd>. Go ahead and change <kbd>19</kbd> to <kbd>30</kbd> in Playgrounds:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/79573220-3eb7-4b7e-a904-885ffdb0c735.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Note that we got the behavior we wanted in the Debug panel.</p>
            
            <p>So far, we have covered using an <kbd>if</kbd> statement with a <kbd>bool</kbd> and an <kbd>Int</kbd>. Let's take a look at one more example using a string. Add this next bit of code
               into Playgrounds:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/76afaef3-8ba1-4ae5-92bd-aeb37059bc43.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In programming, we use equals (<kbd>=</kbd>) when setting data to variables. However, in order to compare two data types, we
               must use the double equals (<kbd>==</kbd>). Therefore, when we write an <kbd>if</kbd> statement that compares two strings we must use double equals (<kbd>==</kbd>) instead of just equals (<kbd>=</kbd>) to determine equality.
            </p>
            
            <p>An <kbd>if...else</kbd> statement only lets us check two conditions, whether they are <kbd>true</kbd> or <kbd>not</kbd>. If we wanted to add more conditions, we would not be able to simply use an <kbd>if...else</kbd> statement. In order to accomplish this, we would use what is called an <kbd>if...else...if...else</kbd>. This statement gives us the ability to add any number of <kbd>else-if</kbd>s inside of our <kbd>if...else</kbd> statement. We will not go overboard, so let's just add one. Update your last <kbd>if...else</kbd> statement to the following:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/2d34e93e-47be-475e-864e-7142a51abd98.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In this example of an <kbd>if...else...if...else</kbd> statement, we are checking whether <kbd>restaurantName</kbd> equals <kbd>La Bamba</kbd>, print <kbd>I've only been to La Bamba II!</kbd> else, if <kbd>restaurantName</kbd> equals <kbd>This restaurant is excellent! else print Oh! I've never heard of that restaurant</kbd>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Using <kbd>if</kbd>, <kbd>if...else</kbd> and <kbd>if...else if...else</kbd> statements really helps you create simple or complex logic for your app. Being able
               to use them with <kbd>Strings</kbd>, <kbd>bools</kbd>, <kbd>Ints</kbd>, and floating-point numbers gives you more flexibility.
            </p>

            <h1 class="header-title">Optionals and optional bindings</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Optionals are used when a value cannot be set. Think of optionals as a container that
               can take either a value or nil. This gives us the ability to check whether the value
               is nil or not. In order to create an optional value, you will have to give it a data
               type followed by a question mark (<kbd>?</kbd>). Before we do that, let's create a string that is not an optional. Add the following
               to Playgrounds:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/ed31aef8-ae52-4799-8244-2661f3462c52.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now, let's add an optional to Playgrounds:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/2af14328-97f5-49d5-980a-91ee6b453472.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In this example, we created a string optional, and, if you notice in the Results panel,
               it is nil. But for our <kbd>notAnOptional</kbd>, we see <kbd>This is not an optional</kbd>. Now, on the next line, let's set <kbd>optional</kbd> equal to <kbd>This is an optional</kbd>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/d30a51c3-e5fa-4ad8-adb9-ec282253ef12.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In our Results panel, we see <kbd>This is an optional</kbd>. Let's now print both <kbd>strNotAnOptional</kbd> and <kbd>strOptional</kbd>, as you will see a difference between the two:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/d8e086aa-241c-4f20-9509-029c86b032dc.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Note that our <kbd>notAnOptional</kbd> variable looks fine, but <kbd>optional</kbd> has an optional wrapped (<kbd>""</kbd>) around the <kbd>String</kbd>. This means that, in order for us to access the value, we must unwrap the optional.
               One way we could do this is by force-unwrapping the optional using an (<kbd>!</kbd>). Let's update our <kbd>print</kbd> statement and change it to the following:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/4bd5377f-de1c-4b37-81d7-d2894b028da6.png"/></div>
            
            <p>We just force-unwrapped our optional, but this method is not recommended. We should
               use what is called <strong>optional binding</strong>, which is the safe way to access the value using an <kbd>if...let</kbd> statement. Remove the (<kbd>!</kbd>) from the <kbd>print</kbd> statement and instead write the following optional binding:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/4d9dfc16-b027-474f-9898-3bad16ebcfd3.png"/></div>
            
            <p>This <kbd>if...let</kbd> statement is saying that if the optional is not nil, set it to <kbd>strValue</kbd>—but, if this optional is nil, ignore it and do nothing. We now do not have to worry
               about anything setting our value and causing our app to crash.
            </p>

         <article>
            
            
            <p>So, now you are probably asking: Why do you have to do this? Trust me, when I first
               learned about optionals, I felt the same way. Optionals were actually made for your
               protection. For now, just understand that, when you see a data type followed by a
               question mark, this variable is an optional. As we work with optionals more and more
               throughout the book, it will become clearer to you.

            <h1 class="header-title">Functions</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Now, it is time to get into a really fun part of programming and learn how to write
               functions. Functions are self-contained pieces of code that you want to run on something.
               In Swift 3, Apple has made a change to how you should write functions. All of the
               functions we will write in this chapter will perform an action (think of verbs). Let's
               create a simple function called <kbd>greet()</kbd>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/3bc6f7b8-d786-41ac-ae1c-77065c7b9c27.png"/></div>
            
            <p>This example is a basic function with a <kbd>print</kbd> statement in it. In programming, functions do not actually run until you call them.
               We call a function simply by calling its name. So, let's call greet:
            </p>
            <pre>greet()</pre>
            <p>Once we add this to the code, this is what we'll see on the screen:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/c4cff64e-3f9d-417d-902d-ac1c713e26eb.png"/></div>
            
            <p>That's it! We just created our first function and called it. However, functions can
               do so much more. We can add what is called a parameter to a function. A parameter
               allows us to accept data types inside our parentheses. Doing this allows us to build
               more reusable chunks of code. So, let's update our <kbd>greet()</kbd> function to accept a parameter called <kbd>name</kbd>:
            </p>
            <pre>func greet(name:String) {<br/>print("Hello")<br/>}</pre>
            <p>After you update the function, you will get an error:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/086d4cf0-3239-4202-ab8d-70d0465d32b2.png"/></div>
            
            <p>We received this error because we updated our function, but we did not update the
               line where we called it. Let's update where we call <kbd>greet()</kbd> to the following:
            </p>
            <pre>greet(name: "Joshua")</pre>
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/3bd342cf-538c-4074-a8b2-e542b9cdd337.png"/></div>
            
            <p>This looks good; however, the Debug panel shows us that we are not using the name
               in our greeting. Earlier, you learned how to create a string interpolation. So, we
               just need to append our variable name inside of our <kbd>print</kbd> statement, as follows:
            </p>
            <pre>print("Hello \(name)")</pre>
            <p>This is how your code will now look:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/4553f86e-d5e6-4861-a1cf-54278a0af278.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Functions can take multiple parameters, so let's create another <kbd>greet()</kbd> function that takes two parameters, a first name and a last name:
            </p>
            <pre>func greet(first:String, last:String) {<br/>print("Hello \(first) \(last)")<br/>}</pre>
            <p>Now, your code and its output should look as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/ca98edf9-3d67-4761-861c-6452b9b15d88.png"/></div>
            
            <p>We also need to update where we called <kbd>greet()</kbd> to accept multiple parameters as well:
            </p>
            <pre>greet(first: "Craig", last: "Clayton")</pre>
            <p>Now, your code and output screen should look something like this:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/804a1db9-3e9b-4916-8e05-867da5c73673.png"/></div>
            
            <p>We now have a function that accepts multiple parameters.</p>
            
            <p>What would be great is if we could make a function that return the greeting to us.
               Well, we can! Whenever we want our function to return something, we need to use a
               noun as a way to describe what our function will do. We just created a function called
               <kbd>greet()</kbd> that takes a first and last name and creates a full name.
            </p>
            
            <p>Now, let's create another function called <kbd>greeting()</kbd>, which will return a full name back with a greeting. Let's see what this looks like:
            </p>
            <pre>func greeting(with first:String, last:String) -&gt; String {<br/>return "Hello \(first) \(last)"<br/>}</pre>
            <p>This is how your code and output screen should look:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/02543775-e32b-4802-bafd-496820b31576.png"/></div>
            
            <p>This function is almost the same as the previous one, but with a couple of new things.
               First <kbd>-&gt; String</kbd> tells the function that we want to return a string. Inside of our function, we return
               <kbd>"Hello \(first) \(last)"</kbd>. Since we said that we want to return something after our parentheses, then we have
               to do just that. Now, let's see how we do this. Enter the following:
            </p>
            <pre>print(greeting(with:"Teena", last:"Harris"))</pre>
            <p>Now, this is how your code and output screen should look:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/b016fa1c-4709-4ae6-9a12-325bdf6c498d.png"/></div>
            
            <p>If you notice, in the Debug panel we now have our full name with <kbd>Hello</kbd> added to the beginning. As you start to build on functions, you really start to see
               the power.
            </p>
            
            <p>These are just the basics of functions. We will cover more advanced functions throughout
               our <em>Let's Eat</em> app. The main thing beginning programmers forget is that functions should be small.
               Your function should do one thing and one thing only. If your function is too long,
               then you need to break it up into smaller chunks. Sometimes longer functions are unavoidable,
               but you should always be mindful of keeping them as small as possible. Nice work!
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Let's work</strong></p>
            
            <p>We covered a lot in this chapter, and now it is time to put everything we covered
               into practice. Here are two challenges. If you are comfortable with them, then work
               on them on your own. Otherwise, go back into this chapter and you can follow along
               with me and see how to do each one:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><strong>Challenge 1</strong>: Write a function that accepts and returns a custom greeting (other than <kbd>Hello</kbd>, which we addressed earlier in this chapter) along with your first and last name
               </li>
               
               <li><strong>Challenge 2</strong>: Write a function that will take two numbers and add, subtract, multiply, or divide
                  those two numbers
               </li>
               
            </ul>

            <p>In this chapter, we learned what type safety is, as well as type inference. We also
               learned about operations with integers as well as working our way through <kbd>if</kbd> statements. Finally, we discussed the power of optionals and learned about what functions
               are and how to use them.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the next chapter, we will move on to some more Swift basics by digging into Swift
               collections. Learning these well will really help you progress in Swift, because you
               will use them all the time.
