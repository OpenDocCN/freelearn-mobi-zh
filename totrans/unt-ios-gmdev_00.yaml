- en: Apple's iOS has taken the world by storm and provided a game development platform,
    which for the first time gives average developers an opportunity to compete in
    the global multi-billion dollar entertainment software space. While there are
    several viable solutions for developing games for this platform, Unity has emerged
    as a leading platform for iOS and other platforms as well. With Unity's toolset,
    and this book, you will take the first steps on your journey to producing commercial
    quality games for the iOS platform.

    are necessary to building an iOS title. From designing (from the mobile perspective)
    to scripting and creating game mechanics that are iOS centric, you will learn
    everything you need to get started. Throughout the course of the book you will
    build on lessons to design and publish a game with integrations to all of the
    components necessary to make a revenue generating title.

    and want to leverage the Unity platform, this book will provide the core knowledge
    that you need to get started. If you are a Unity developer looking to port an
    existing application to the mobile platform, this book will give you an overview

    developer with either of these languages, you will still learn how to apply your
    skills to learn mobile development using this book, because much of the book is
    geared to an exploration of the concepts and implementation with Unity and the
    iOS platform.

    scenarios where Javascript is used as an instructional aid. While there is sufficient
    information to learn the necessary components of C# within the book, it is not
    a goal of the book to teach C# or its fundamentals.
