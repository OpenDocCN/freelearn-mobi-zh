<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Learning a programming language is a daunting experience for many people, and not one that most individuals generally choose to undertake. As you have chosen to pick up this book, I assume that you have an interest in learning the Kotlin programming language and perhaps even becoming an expert at it someday. As a consequence, permit me to congratulate you on taking a bold step toward learning this language.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Regardless of the problem domain that you may wish to build solutions for, be it application development, networking, or distributed systems, Kotlin is a good choice for the development of systems to achieve the required solutions. In other words, a developer can't go wrong with learning Kotlin. At this point, a proper introduction to the Kotlin language is required.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kotlin is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language that runs on the <strong>Java Virtual Machine</strong> (<strong>JVM</strong>) and can be used to develop applications in numerous problem domains. In addition to running on the JVM, Kotlin can be compiled to JavaScript, and as such, is an equally strong choice for developing client-side web applications. Kotlin can also be compiled directly into native binaries that run on systems without a virtual machine via Kotlin/Native. The Kotlin programming language was primarily developed by JetBrains – a company based in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The developers at JetBrains are the current maintainers of the language. Kotlin was named after Kotlin island – an island near Saint Petersburg.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kotlin was designed to be used to develop industrial-strength software in many domains, but has seen the majority of its use come from the Android ecosystem. At the time of writing, Kotlin is one of the three languages that have been declared by Google as an official language for Android. Kotlin is syntactically similar to Java. As a matter of fact, it was designed to be a better alternative to Java. As a consequence, there are numerous significant advantages to using Kotlin instead of Java in software development.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn the&#160;following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The installation of Kotlin</li>
<li>The fundamentals of the Kotlin programming language</li>
<li>Installing and setting up Android Studio</li>
<li>Gradle</li>
<li>The fundamentals of the web</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In order to develop the Kotlin program, you will first need to install the <strong>Java Runtime Environment</strong> (<strong>JRE</strong>) on your computer. The JRE can be downloaded prepackaged along with a <strong>Java Development Kit</strong> (<strong>JDK</strong>). For the sake of this installation, we will be using the JDK.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The easiest way to install a JDK on a computer is to utilize one of the JDK installers made available by Oracle (the owners of Java). There are different installers available for all major operating systems. Releases of the JDK can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html"><span class="s2">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</span></a>:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that we have our command-line compiler set up, let's try it out with a simple Kotlin program.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As previously stated, Kotlin can be used to write scripts.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Writing a Kotlin script is similar to writing a Kotlin program. In fact, a script written in Kotlin is exactly like a regular Kotlin program! The only significant difference between a Kotlin script and regular Kotlin program is the absence of a main function.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As you've most likely guessed, the preceding script will print the sum of <kbd>1</kbd> and <kbd>2</kbd> to the standard system output. Save the changes to the file and run<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>the script:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">kotlinc -script NumberSum.kts</span></strong></pre>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">REPL is an acronym that stands for <strong>Read–Eval–Print Loop</strong>. An REPL is an interactive shell environment in which programs can be executed with immediate results given. The</span><span class="s1">&#160;interactive shell environment can be invoked by running the <kbd>kotlinc</kbd> command without any arguments.</span></p>
<div class="p1 packt_infobox"><span class="s1">The Kotlin REPL can be started by running <kbd>kotlinc</kbd> in your terminal.</span></div>
<p>If the REPL is successfully started, a welcome message will be printed in your terminal followed by&#160;<kbd>&gt;&gt;&gt;</kbd> on the next line, alerting us that the REPL is awaiting input. Now you can type in code within the terminal, as you would in any text editor, and get immediate feedback from the REPL. This is demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Writing programs with the command line has its uses, but in most cases, it is better to use software built specifically for the purpose of empowering developers to write programs. This is especially true in cases where a large project is being worked on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An IDE is a computer application that hosts a collection of tools and utilities for computer programmers for software development. There are a number of IDEs that can be used for Kotlin development. Out of these IDEs, the one with the most comprehensive set of features for the purpose of developing Kotlin applications is IntelliJ IDEA. As IntelliJ IDEA is built by the creators of Kotlin, there are numerous advantages in using it over other IDEs, such as an unparalleled feature set of tools for writing Kotlin programs, as well as timely updates that cater to the newest advancements and additions to the Kotlin programming language.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Variables</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A variable is an identifier for a memory location that holds a value. A simpler way to describe a variable is an identifier that holds a value. Consider the following program:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {<br/><span>  var x: Int = 1<br/>}</span><br/></span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The preceding <kbd>x</kbd>&#160;is a variable and the value it holds is <kbd>1</kbd>. More specifically, <kbd>x</kbd> is an integer variable. The <kbd>x</kbd> is referred to as an integer variable because <kbd>x</kbd> has been defined to have the&#160;<kbd>Int</kbd>&#160;data type. As such, the&#160;<kbd>x</kbd>&#160;variable can only hold an integer value. To be more accurate, we say that <kbd>x</kbd> is an instance of the <kbd>Int</kbd> class. At this point, you must be wondering what the words instance and class&#160;mean in this context. All will be revealed in due time. For now, let's focus on the topic of variables.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When defining a variable in Kotlin, we make use of the&#160;<kbd>var</kbd>&#160;keyword. This keyword specifies that the variable is mutable in nature. Thus, it can be changed. The data type of the declared variable comes after a semicolon that follows the variable's identifier. It is important to note that the data type of a variable need not be explicitly defined. This is because Kotlin supports type inference—the ability to infer types of objects upon definition. We might as well have written the definition of our&#160;<kbd>x</kbd>&#160;variable as:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">var x = 1</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The outcome of the definition would be the same. A semicolon can be added to the end of the line of our variable definition but, similar to languages like JavaScript, it is not required:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">var x = 1 // I am a variable identified by x and I hold a value of 1<br/>var y = 2 // I am a variable identified by y and I hold a value of 2<br/>var z: Int = x + y // I am a variable identified by z and I hold a value of 3</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we don't want the values of our variables to change over the course of the execution of our program, we can do so by making them immutable. Immutable variables are defined with the <kbd>val</kbd> keyword, as follows:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">val x = 200</span></pre>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Variable scope</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The scope of a variable is the region of a program where the variable is of consequence. In other words, the scope of a variable is the region of a program in which the variable can be used. Kotlin variables have block scope. Therefore, the variables can be utilized in all regions that the block they were defined in covers:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {<br/><span>  // block A begins</span><br/><span>  var a = 10</span><br/><span>  var i = 1</span><br/><br/><span>  while (i &lt; 10) {</span><br/><span>    // block B begins</span><br/><span>    val b = a / i</span><br/><span>    print(b)<br/>    i++<br/></span>  }<br/><span>  print(b) // Error occurs: variable b is out of scope</span><br/>}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the preceding program, we can directly observe the effects of block scope by taking a look at the two blocks. The definition of a function opened a new block. We have labeled to this block as <kbd>B</kbd> in our example. Within <kbd>A</kbd>, the&#160;<kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>i</kbd>&#160;variables were declared. As such, the scope of the&#160;<kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>i</kbd>&#160;variables exists within <kbd>A</kbd>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A <kbd>while</kbd> loop was created within <kbd>A</kbd>, and as such, a new&#160;<kbd>B</kbd>&#160;block was opened. Loop declarations mark the beginning of new blocks. Within <kbd>B</kbd>, a&#160;<kbd>b</kbd>&#160;value is declared. The&#160;<kbd>b</kbd>&#160;value exists in the&#160;<kbd>B</kbd>&#160;scope and can't be used outside its scope. As such, when we attempt to print the value held by <kbd>b</kbd> outside the&#160;<kbd>B</kbd>&#160;block, an error will occur.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing worth noting is that the&#160;<kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>i</kbd>&#160;variables can still be utilized within the&#160;<kbd>B</kbd>&#160;block. This is because <kbd>B</kbd> exists within the scope of <kbd>A</kbd>.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An array is a data structure consisting of a set of elements or values with each element possessing at least one index or key. Arrays are very useful in storing collections of elements you wish to utilize later on in a program.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Kotlin, arrays are created using the <kbd>arrayOf()</kbd> library method. The values you wish to store in the array are passed in a comma-separated sequence:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">val names = arrayOf("Tobi", "Tonia", "Timi")</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each array value has a unique index that both specifies its position in the array and can be used to retrieve the value later on. The set of indices in an array starts with the index, 0, and progresses with an increment of 1.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The value held in any given index position of an array can be retrieved by either calling the <kbd>Array#get()</kbd> method or by using the <kbd>[]</kbd> operation:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4)<br/></span><span class="s1">println(numbers[0]) // Prints 1<br/></span><span class="s1">println(numbers.get(1)) // Prints 2</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At any point in time, the value at a position of an array can be changed:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4)<br/></span><span class="s1">println(numbers[0]) // Prints 1<br/></span><span class="s1">numbers[0] = 23<br/></span><span class="s1">println(numbers[0]) // Prints 23</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can check the size of an array at any time with its <kbd>length</kbd> property:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A function is a block of code that can be defined once and reused any number of times. When writing programs, it is best practice to break up complex programmatic processes into smaller units that perform specific tasks. Doing this has many advantages, some of which are:</span></p>
<ul class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Improving code readability</strong>: It is much easier to read programs that have been broken down into functional units. This is because the scope of the code to be understood at any given point in time is reduced when functions are utilized. The majority of the time, a programmer needs to only write or adjust a section of a large code base. When functions are utilized, the context of the program that needs to be read to ameliorate program logic is restricted to the body of the function in which the logic is written.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Improving the maintainability of a code base</strong>: The use of functions in a code base makes it easy to maintain programs. If a change needs to be made to a particular program feature, many times it is as easy as adjusting a function in which the feature has been created.</span></li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Functions are declared with the <kbd>fun</kbd>&#160;keyword. The following is a simple function definition:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">fun printSum(a: Int, b: Int) {<br/>  print(a + b)<br/>}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The function simply prints the sum of two values that have been passed as arguments to it. Function definitions can be broken down into the following components:</span></p>
<ul class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>A function identifier</strong>: The identifier of a function is the name given to it. An identifier is required to refer to the function if we wish to invoke it later on in a program. In the preceding function declaration, <kbd>printSum</kbd> is the identifier of the function.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1"><strong>A pair of parentheses containing a comma-separated list of the arguments being passed as values to the function</strong>: Values passed to a function are called arguments of the function. All arguments passed to the function must have a type. The type definition of an argument follows a semicolon placed after the argument name.</span></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>A return type specification</strong>: Return types of functions are specified similarly to the way the types of variables and properties are. The return type specification follows the last parenthesis and is done by writing the type after a semicolon.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>A block containing the body of the function</strong>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Observing the preceding function, it may appear that it has no return type. This is not <kbd>true</kbd>, the function has a return type of <kbd>Unit</kbd>. A unit return type need not be explicitly specified. The function might as well be declared as follows:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">fun printSum(a: Int, b: Int): Unit {<br/>  print(a + b)<br/>}</span></pre>
<div class="p1 packt_infobox"><span class="s1">An identifier is not required for a function. Functions that do not possess an identifier are called anonymous functions. Anonymous functions are present in Kotlin in the form of lambdas.</span></div>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Functions are not executed once they are defined. In order for the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>code within a function to be executed, the function must be invoked. Functions can be invoked as functions, as methods, and indirectly by utilizing the <kbd>invoke()</kbd> and <kbd>call()</kbd> methods. The following shows the direct functional invocation using the function itself:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">fun repeat(word: String, times: Int) { <br/>  var i = 0<br/><br/>  while (i &lt; times) {<br/>    println(word)<br/>    i++<br/>  }<br/>}<br/><br/>fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {<br/>  repeat("Hello!", 5)<br/>}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Compile and run the preceding code. The word <kbd>Hello</kbd>&#160;is printed on the screen five times. <kbd>Hello</kbd> was passed as our first value in the function and <kbd>5</kbd> as our second.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span> As a result of this, the&#160;<kbd>word</kbd> and <kbd>times</kbd>&#160;arguments are set to hold the&#160;<kbd>Hello</kbd> and <kbd>5</kbd>&#160;values in our repeat function. Our <kbd>while</kbd> loop runs<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>and prints our word as long as <kbd>i</kbd> is less than the number of times specified. <kbd>i++</kbd> is used to increase the value of <kbd>i</kbd> by 1. <kbd>i</kbd> is increased by one upon each iteration of the loop. The loop stops once <kbd>i</kbd> is equal to <kbd>5</kbd>. Hence, our word <kbd>Hello</kbd> will be printed five times.</span>&#160;Compiling and running the program will give us the following output:</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A return value—as the name implies—is the value that a method returns. Functions in Kotlin can return values upon execution. The type of the value returned by a function is defined by the function's&#160;return type. This is demonstrated in the following code snippet:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">fun returnFullName(firstName: String, surname: String): String {<br/></span><span class="s1">  return "${firstName} ${surname}"<br/></span><span class="s1">}<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>val fullName: String = returnFullName("James", "Cameron")<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>println(fullName) // prints: James Cameron<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the preceding code, the&#160;<kbd><span>returnFullName</span></kbd> function takes two distinct strings as its input parameters and returns a string value when called. The return type has been defined in the function header. The string returned is created via string templates:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">"${firstName} ${surname}"</span></strong></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The values for first name and last name are interpolated into the string of characters.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When writing programs, a scenario that often occurs is one in which we want to control how our program executes. This is necessary if we want to write programs that can make decisions based on conditions and program state. Kotlin possesses a number of structures for doing this, which will be familiar to people who have worked with programming languages in the past, such as <kbd>if</kbd>, <kbd>while</kbd>, and <kbd>for</kbd> constructs. There are also others that may not be familiar to individuals, such as the <kbd>when</kbd> construct.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <kbd>if</kbd> expression is used to make a logical decision based on the fulfillment of a condition. We make use of the <kbd>if</kbd> keyword to write <kbd>if</kbd> expressions:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">val a = 1<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">if (a == 1) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>print("a is one")<br/></span><span class="s1">} </span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The preceding&#160;<kbd>if</kbd> expression tests whether the&#160;<kbd>a == 1</kbd> (read: <kbd>a</kbd> is equal to <kbd>1</kbd>) condition holds <kbd>true</kbd>. If the condition is <kbd>true</kbd>, the&#160;<kbd>a is one</kbd>&#160;string is printed on the screen, otherwise nothing is printed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An&#160;<kbd>if</kbd> expressions often has one or more accompanying <kbd>else</kbd> or <kbd>else if</kbd> keywords. These accompanying keywords can be used to further control the flow of a program. Take the following&#160;<kbd>if</kbd>&#160;expression for example:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">val a = 4<br/></span><span class="s1">if (a == 1) {<br/></span><span class="s1">  print("a is equal to one.")<br/></span><span class="s1">} else if (a == 2) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">    </span>print("a is equal to two.")<br/></span><span class="s1">} else {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">    </span>print("a is neither one nor two.")<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The preceding expression first tests whether <kbd>a</kbd> is equal to <kbd>1</kbd>. This test evaluates to <kbd>false</kbd> so, the following condition has been tested. Surely <kbd>a</kbd> is not equal to <kbd>2</kbd>. Hence the second condition evaluates to <kbd>false</kbd>. As a result of all previous conditions evaluating to <kbd>false</kbd>, the final statement is executed. Hence <kbd>a is neither one nor two.</kbd>&#160;is printed on the screen.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <kbd>when</kbd> expression is another means of controlling program flow. Let's observe how it works with a simple example:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">fun printEvenNumbers(numbers: Array&lt;Int&gt;) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>numbers.forEach {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>when (it % 2) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>0 -&gt; println(it)<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1">}<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">fun main (args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>val numberList: Array&lt;Int&gt; = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>printEvenNumbers(numberList)<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The preceding&#160;<kbd>printEvenSum</kbd> function takes an integer array as its only argument. We will cover arrays later on in this chapter, but for now think of them as a sequential collection of values existing in a value space. In this case, the array passed contains values that exist in the value space of integers. Each element of the array is iterated upon using the <kbd>forEach</kbd> method and each number is tested in the <kbd>when</kbd> expression.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, the <kbd>it</kbd> refers to the current value being iterated upon by the <kbd>forEach</kbd> method. The <kbd>%</kbd>&#160;operator is a binary operator that acts on two operands. It divides the first operand by the second and returns the remainder of the division. Thus, the <kbd>when</kbd> expression tests if/when the current value iterated upon (the value held within <kbd>it</kbd>) is divided by <kbd>2</kbd>&#160;and has a remainder of <kbd>0</kbd>. If it does, the value is even and hence the value is printed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To observe how the program works, copy and paste the preceding code into a file, then compile and run the program:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Elvis operator is a terse structure that is present in Kotlin. It takes the following form:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">(expression) ?: value2<br/></span></pre>
<p>Its usage in a Kotlin program is demonstrated in the following code block:</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looping statements are used to ensure that a collection of statements within a block of code repeats in execution. That is, a loop ensures that a number of statements within a program executes for a number of times. The looping constructs provided by Kotlin are the <kbd>for</kbd> loop, the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop, and the&#160;<kbd>do…while</kbd> loop.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <kbd>for</kbd> loop in Kotlin iterates over any object that provides an iterator. It is similar to the <kbd>for..in</kbd> loop in Ruby. The loop has this syntax:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">for (obj in collection) { … }</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The block in the <kbd>for</kbd> loop is not necessary if only a single statement exists in the loop. A collection is a type of structure that provides an iterator. Consider the following program:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">val numSet = arrayOf(1, 563, 23)<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">for (number in numSet) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">  </span>println(number)<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each value in the <kbd>numSet</kbd> <span>array&#160;</span>is iterated upon by the loop and assigned to the variable number. The number is then printed to the standard system output.</span></p>
<div class="p1 packt_infobox"><span class="s1">Every element of an array has an index. An index is the position an element holds within an array. The set of indices of an array in Kotlin starts from zero.</span></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If instead of printing the numeric values of the number iterated upon, we wish to print the indices of each number, we can do that as follows:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">for (index in numSet.indices) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">  </span>println(index)<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can specify a type for your iterator variable as well:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">for (number: Int in numSet) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">  </span>println(number)<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A <kbd>while</kbd> loop executes instructions within a block as long as a specified condition is met. The <kbd>while</kbd> loops are created using the <kbd>while</kbd>&#160;keyword. It takes the following form:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">while (condition) { … }</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As in the case of the <kbd>for</kbd> loop, the block is optional in the case where only one sentence is within the scope of the loop. In a <kbd>while</kbd> loop, the statements in the block execute repeatedly while the condition specified still holds. Consider the following code:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">val names = arrayOf("Jeffrey", "William", "Golding", "Segun", "Bob")<br/></span><span class="s1">var i = 0<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">while (!names[i].equals("Segun")) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">  </span>println("I am not Segun.")<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">  </span>i++<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the preceding program, the block of code within the <kbd>while</kbd> loop executes and prints <kbd>I am not Segun</kbd>&#160;until the name <kbd>Segun</kbd>&#160;is encountered. Once <kbd>Segun</kbd> is encountered, the loop terminates and nothing else is printed out, as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Often when declaring loops, there is a need to either break out of the loop if a condition fulfills, or start the next iteration at any point in time within the loop. This can be done with the <kbd>break</kbd> and <kbd>continue</kbd> keywords. Let's take an example to explain this further. Open a new Kotlin script file and copy the following code into it:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">data class Student(val name: String, val age: Int, val school: String)<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">val prospectiveStudents: ArrayList&lt;Student&gt; = ArrayList()<br/></span><span class="s1">val admittedStudents: ArrayList&lt;Student&gt; = ArrayList()<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">prospectiveStudents.add(Student("Daniel Martinez", 12, "Hogwarts"))<br/></span><span class="s1">prospectiveStudents.add(Student("Jane Systrom", 22, "Harvard"))<br/></span><span class="s1">prospectiveStudents.add(Student("Matthew Johnson", 22, "University of Maryland"))<br/></span><span class="s1">prospectiveStudents.add(Student("Jide Sowade", 18, "University of Ibadan"))<br/></span><span class="s1">prospectiveStudents.add(Student("Tom Hanks", 25, "Howard University"))<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">for (student in prospectiveStudents) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>if (student.age &lt; 16) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>continue<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>admittedStudents.add(student)<br/><br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>if (admittedStudents.size &gt;= 3) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>break<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1">}<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">println(admittedStudents)</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The preceding program is simplistic software for selecting admitted students out of a list of prospective students. We create a data class at the start of our program to model the data of each student, then two array lists are created. One array list holds the information of the prospective students, those that have applied for admission, and the other list holds the information of the students that have been admitted.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The next five lines of code add prospective students to the prospective student list. We then declare a loop that iterates over all students present in the prospective student list. If the age of the current student in the loop is less than 16 years old, the loop skips to the next iteration. This models the scenario in where a student is<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>too young to be admitted (thus not added to the admitted students list).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the student is 16 or older, the student is added to the admitted list. An <kbd>if</kbd> expression is then used to check whether the number of admitted students is greater than or equal to three. If the condition is true, the program breaks out of the loop and no further iterations are done. The last line of the program prints out the students present in the list.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Run the program to see the output:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <kbd>do…while</kbd> loop is similar to the <kbd>while</kbd> loop, with the exception that in the conditional test for the reiteration of the loop, it is carried out after the first iteration. It takes the following form:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">do { <br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>...<br/></span><span class="s1">} while (condition) </span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The statements within the block are executed while the condition tested holds <kbd>true</kbd>:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">var i = 0<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">do {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>println("I’m in here!")<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>i++<br/></span><span class="s1">} while (i &lt; 10)<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">println("I’m out here!")</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Nullable values</strong>:&#160;</span><span class="s1">The <kbd>NullPointerException</kbd> is one thing that individuals who have first-hand experience writing Java code are certain to have encountered. The Kotlin type system is null-safe—it attempts to eliminate the occurrence of null references within code. As a result, Kotlin possesses nullable types and non-nullable types (types that can hold a null value and those that can't).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To properly explain the&#160;<span><kbd>NullPointerException</kbd>, w</span>e will consider the following Java program:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">class NullPointerExample {<br/><br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>public static void main(String[] args) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>String name = "James Gates";<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>System.out.println(name.length()); // Prints 11<br/><br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>name = null; // assigning a value of null to name<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>System.out.println(name.length()); // throws NullPointerException<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p><span>The preceding program performs the simple task of printing the length of a string variable to the standard system output. There is only one problem with our program. When we compile and run it, it throws a null pointer exception and terminates midway through execution, as we can see the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="p1 CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/b83699fa-31e2-46fd-bec9-384a7e2b2968.jpg" style="width:43.42em;height:13.92em;"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Can you spot the cause of the <kbd>NullPointerException</kbd>? The exception arises as a result of the <kbd>String#length</kbd> method being used on a null reference. As such, the program stops executing and throws the exception. Clearly, this is not something we want to occur in our programs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can prevent this in Kotlin by preventing the assignment of a null value to the name object:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">var name: String = "James Gates"<br/></span><span class="s1">println(name.length)<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">name = null // null value assignment not permitted<br/></span><span class="s1">println(name.length)</span></pre>
<p><span>As can be seen in the following screenshot, Kotlin's type system detects that a null value has been inappropriately assigned to the <kbd>name</kbd> variable and swiftly alerts the programmer of this blunder so it can be corrected:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/d79645e5-90ab-4476-a979-40c1ac0fb675.jpg" style="width:45.17em;height:15.33em;"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this point, you may be wondering what happens if a scenario arises in which the programmer intends to permit the passing of null values. In that scenario, the programmer simply declares the value as nullable by appending <kbd>?</kbd> to the type of the variable:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">var name: String? = "James"<br/></span><span class="s1">println(name.length)<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">name = null // null value assignment permitted<br/></span><span class="s1">println(name.length)</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Regardless of the fact that we have declared the variable name to be nullable, we'll still get an error upon running the program. This is because we must access the length property of the variable in a safe way. This can be done with <kbd>?.</kbd>:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">var name: String? = "James"<br/></span><span class="s1">println(name?.length)<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">name = null // null value assignment permitted<br/></span><span class="s1">println(name?.length)</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that we have used the&#160;<kbd>?.</kbd>&#160;safe operator, the program will run as intended. Instead of a null pointer exception being thrown, the type system recognizes that a null pointer has been referenced and prevents the invocation of <kbd>length()</kbd> on the null object. The following screenshot shows the type-safe output:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/9bef2b92-61cb-4b9b-9fb3-edbe1f357c8e.jpg" style="width:42.67em;height:14.33em;"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An alternative to using the&#160;<kbd>?.</kbd>&#160;safe operator would be to use the <kbd>!!</kbd> operator. The <kbd>!!</kbd> operator allows the program to continue execution and throws a <kbd>KotlinNullPointerException</kbd> once a function invocation is attempted on a null reference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can see the effects by replacing <kbd>?.</kbd>&#160;with <kbd>!!.</kbd>&#160;in our written program. The following screenshot shows the output of the program when run. A <kbd>KotlinNullPointerException</kbd> is thrown as a result of the utilization of the <kbd>!!</kbd> operator:</span></p>

<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">package animals<br/></span><span class="s1">data class Buffalo(val mass: Int, val maxSpeed: Int, var isDead: Boolean = false)</span></pre>
<p class="p1">In the following code snippet, the <kbd>Buffalo</kbd> class does not need to be imported into the program because it exists in the same package (<kbd>animals</kbd>) as the <kbd>Lion</kbd> class:</p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">package animals<br/></span><span class="s1">class Lion(val mass: Int, val maxSpeed: Int) {<br/><br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>fun kill(animal: Buffalo) { // Buffalo type used with our import<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>if (!animal.isDead) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>println("Lion attacking animal.")<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>animal.isDead = true<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>println("Lion kill successful.")<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In order to import classes, functions, interfaces, and types in separate packages, we use the <kbd>import</kbd> keyword followed by the package name. For example, the following&#160;<kbd>main</kbd> function exists in the default package. As such, if we want to make use of the <kbd>Lion</kbd> and <kbd>Buffalo</kbd> classes in the <kbd>main</kbd> function, we must import it with the <kbd>import</kbd> keyword. Consider the following code:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">import animals.Buffalo<br/></span><span class="s1">import animals.Lion<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>val lion = Lion(190, 80)<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>val buffalo = Buffalo(620, 60)<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>println("Buffalo is dead: ${buffalo.isDead}")<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>lion.kill(buffalo)<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>println("Buffalo is dead: ${buffalo.isDead}")<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>

            <article>
                
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the beginning of high-level programming languages, programs were written procedurally. The programming languages available were mainly procedural in nature. A procedural programming language is a language that utilizes a series of structured, well-defined steps to compose programs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the software industry grew larger and programs grew bulkier, it became necessary to devise a better approach to designing software. This led to the advent of object-oriented programming languages.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The object-oriented programming model is a model organized around objects and data rather than actions and sequential logic. In object-oriented programming, objects, classes, and interfaces are composed, extended, and inherited toward the goal of building industrial-strength software.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A <strong>class</strong> is a modifiable and extensible program template for the creation of objects and the maintenance of state through the use of variables, constants, and properties. A class possesses characteristics and behaviors. Characteristics are exposed as variables and behaviors are implemented in the form of methods. Methods are functions that are specific to a class or a collection of classes. Classes have the ability to inherit characteristics and behaviors from other classes. This ability is called <strong>inheritance</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kotlin is a fully object-oriented programming language and hence supports all features of object-oriented programming. In Kotlin, similar to Java and Ruby, only single inheritance is permitted. Some languages, such as C++, support multiple inheritance. A downside to multiple inheritance is that it brings up management issues, such as same name collisions. A class inheriting from another class is referred to as a subclass and the class it inherits from is its superclass.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An <strong>interface</strong> is a structure that enforces certain characteristics and behaviors in classes. Behavioral enforcements via interfaces can be done by implementing an interface in a class. Similar to classes, an interface can extend another interface.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An <strong>object</strong> is an instance of a class that may possesses its own unique state.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A class is declared using the <kbd>class</kbd> keyword followed by the class name:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">class Person</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As in the preceding example, a class in Kotlin need not have a body. Though this is charming, almost all the time you will want your class to have characteristics and behaviors placed within a body. This can be done with the use of opening and closing brackets:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">class HelloPrinter {<br/></span><span class="s1">  fun printHello() {<br/></span><span class="s1">    println("Hello!")<br/></span><span class="s1">  }<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the preceding code snippet, we have a class named <kbd>HelloPrinter</kbd> with a single function declared in it. A function that is declared within a class is called a method. Methods can also be referred to as behaviors. Once a method is declared, it can be used by all instances of the class.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Declaring an instance of a class—or an object—is similar to declaring a variable. We can create an instance of the <kbd>HelloPrinter</kbd> class, as shown in the following code:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">val printer = HelloPrinter()</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The preceding <kbd>printer</kbd>&#160;is an instance of the <kbd>HelloPrinter</kbd>&#160;class. The opening and closing brackets after the&#160;<kbd>HelloPrinter</kbd>&#160;class name are used to invoke the primary constructor of the <kbd>HelloPrinter</kbd> class. A constructor is similar to a function. A constructor is a special function that initializes an object of a type.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The function declared within the <kbd>HelloPrinter</kbd> class can be invoked directly by the <kbd>printer</kbd> object at any point in time:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">printer.printHello() // Prints hello</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Occasionally, you may require a function to be directly invokable with the class without needing to create an object. This can be done with the use of a companion object.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Companion objects are declared within a class by utilizing the <kbd>companion</kbd> and <kbd>object</kbd> keywords. You can use functions that are static within a companion object:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">class Printer {<br/></span><span class="s1">  companion object DocumentPrinter {<br/></span><span class="s1">    fun printDocument() = println("Document printing successful.")<br/></span><span class="s1">  }<br/></span><span class="s1">}<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {<br/></span><span class="s1">  Printer.printDocument() // printDocument() invoked via companion object<br/></span><span class="s1">  Printer.Companion.printDocument() // also invokes printDocument() via <br/>                                    // a companion object<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes, you may want to give an identifier to a companion object. This can be done by placing the name after the <kbd>object</kbd> keyword. Consider the following example:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">class Printer {<br/></span><span class="s1">  companion object DocumentPrinter { // Companion object identified by DocumentPrinter<br/></span><span class="s1">    fun printDocument() = println("Document printing successful.")<br/></span><span class="s1">  }<br/></span><span class="s1">}<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {<br/></span><span class="s1">  Printer.DocumentPrinter.printDocument() // printDocument() invoked via<br/>                                          // a named companion object<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>

            <article>
                
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Classes can have properties that may be declared using the <kbd>var</kbd> and <kbd>val</kbd> keywords. For example, in the following code snippet, the <kbd>Person</kbd> class has three properties,&#160;<kbd>age</kbd>, <kbd>firstName</kbd>, and <kbd>surname</kbd>:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">class Person {</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span> var age = 0<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>var firstName = ""<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>var surname = ""<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Properties can be accessed through an instance of the class holding the property. This is done by appending a single dot character (<kbd>.</kbd>) to an instance identifier followed by the property name. For example, in the following code snippet, an instance—named <kbd>person</kbd>—of the <kbd>Person</kbd> class is created and its <kbd>firstName</kbd>, <kbd>surname</kbd>, and <kbd>age</kbd> properties are assigned by accessing the properties:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">val person = Person()<br/></span><span class="s1">person.firstName = "Raven"<br/></span><span class="s1">person.surname = "Spacey"<br/></span><span class="s1">person.age = 35</span></pre>

            <article>
                
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As previously discussed, Kotlin was designed to be a better Java, and as such, there are a number of advantages to using Kotlin over Java:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Null safety</strong>: One common occurrence in Java programs is the throwing of <kbd>NullPointerException</kbd>. Kotlin alleviates this issue by providing a null-safe type system.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s2"><strong>Presence of extension functions</strong>: Functions can easily be added to classes defined in program files to extend their functionality in various ways. This can be done with extension functions in Kotlin.</span></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Singletons</strong>: It is easy to implement the singleton pattern in Kotlin programs. The implementation of a singleton in Java takes considerably more effort than when it is done with Kotlin.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Data classes</strong>: When writing programs, it is a common scenario to have to create a class for the sole purpose of holding data in variables. This often leads to the writing of many lines of code for such a mundane task. Data classes in Kotlin make it extremely easy to create such classes that hold data with a single line of code.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><strong>Function types</strong>: Unlike Java, Kotlin has function types. This enables functions to accept other functions as parameters and the definition of functions that return functions.</span></li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have taken a concise look at some of the features Kotlin has put at our disposal for developing powerful applications. Over the course of this book, we will explore how these features can be utilized in Android application development - an area in which Kotlin shines.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before getting started on this journey, we must set up our systems for the task at hand. A major necessity for developing Android applications is a suitable IDE - it is not a requirement but it makes the development process easier. Many IDE choices exist for Android developers. The most popular are:</span></p>
<ul class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Android Studio</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Eclipse</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">IntelliJ IDE</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Android Studio is by far the most powerful of the IDEs available with respect to Android development. As a consequence, we will be utilizing this IDE in all Android-related chapters in this book.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A <strong>user interface</strong> (<strong>UI</strong>) is the primary means by which a user interacts with an application. The user interfaces of Android applications are made by the creation and manipulation of layout files. Layout files are XML files that exist in <kbd>app&#160;<span>|</span>&#160;res&#160;<span>|</span> layout</kbd>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To create the layout for the <em>HelloApp</em>, we are going to do three things:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Add a <kbd>LinearLayout</kbd> to our layout file</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Place the <kbd>TextView</kbd> within the <kbd>LinearLayout</kbd> and remove the <kbd>android:text</kbd> attribute it possesses</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Add a button to the <kbd>LinearLayout</kbd></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Open the <kbd>activity_hello.xml</kbd> file if it's not already opened. You will be presented with the layout editor. If the editor is in the <kbd>Design</kbd> view, change it to its <kbd>Text</kbd> view by toggling the option at the bottom of the layout editor. Now, your layout editor should look similar to that of the following screenshot:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/8979d6ee-67a7-4437-8086-9170fee81d50.png" style="width:61.08em;height:38.17em;"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A <kbd>LinearLayout</kbd> is a <kbd>ViewGroup</kbd> that arranges child views in either a horizontal or vertical manner within a single column. Copy the code snippet of our required <kbd>LinearLayout</kbd> from the following block and paste it within the <kbd>ConstraintLayout</kbd> preceding the <kbd>TextView</kbd>:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;LinearLayout<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:id="@+id/ll_component_container"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:layout_width="match_parent"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:layout_height="match_parent"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:orientation="vertical"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:gravity="center"&gt;<br/></span><span class="s1">&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, copy and paste the <kbd>TextView</kbd> present in the <kbd>activity_hello.xml</kbd> file into the body of the <kbd>LinearLayout</kbd> element and remove the <kbd>android:text</kbd> attribute:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;LinearLayout<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:id="@+id/ll_component_container"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:layout_width="match_parent"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:layout_height="match_parent"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:orientation="vertical"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:gravity="center"&gt;<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;TextView<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:id="@+id/tv_greeting"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:layout_width="wrap_content"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>android:layout_height="wrap_content"<br/></span><span class="s1">       android:textSize="50sp" /&gt;<br/></span><span class="s1">&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lastly, we need to add a button element to our layout file. This element will be a child of our <kbd>LinearLayout</kbd>. To create a button, we use the <kbd>Button</kbd> element:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;LinearLayout<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:id="@+id/ll_component_container"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:layout_width="match_parent"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:layout_height="match_parent"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:orientation="vertical"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:gravity="center"&gt;<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;TextView<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:id="@+id/tv_greeting"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:layout_width="wrap_content"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:layout_height="wrap_content"<br/></span><span class="s1">       android:textSize="50sp" /&gt;<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;Button<br/></span><span class="s1">       android:id="@+id/btn_click_me"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:layout_width="wrap_content"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:layout_height="wrap_content"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:layout_marginTop="16dp"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span> android:text="Click me!"/&gt;<br/></span><span class="s1">&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Toggle to the layout editor's design view to see how the changes we have made thus far translate when rendered on the user interface:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="images/67e7e213-d82f-4343-bc64-41c24b8b95e1.jpg" style="width:14.92em;height:24.92em;"/></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now we have our layout, but there's a problem. Our <span class="packt_screen">CLICK ME!</span> button does not actually do anything when clicked. We are going to fix that by adding a listener for click events to the button. Locate and open the <kbd>HelloActivity.java</kbd> file and edit the function to add the logic for the&#160;<span class="packt_screen">CLICK ME!</span> button's click event as well as the required package imports, as shown in the following code:</span></p>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">package com.mydomain.helloapp<br/></span><span class="s1">import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity<br/></span><span class="s1">import android.os.Bundle<br/></span><span class="s1">import android.text.TextUtils<br/></span><span class="s1">import android.widget.Button<br/></span><span class="s1">import android.widget.TextView<br/></span><span class="s1">import android.widget.Toast<br/><br/></span><span class="s1">class HelloActivity : AppCompatActivity() {<br/><br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>setContentView(R.layout.activity_hello)<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>val tvGreeting = findViewById&lt;TextView&gt;(R.id.tv_greeting)<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>val btnClickMe = findViewById&lt;Button&gt;(R.id.btn_click_me)<br/><br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>btnClickMe.setOnClickListener {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>if (TextUtils.isEmpty(tvGreeting.text)) {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">        </span>tvGreeting.text = "Hello World!"<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>} else {<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">        </span>Toast.makeText(this, "I have been clicked!", <br/>                       Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>}<br/></span><span class="s1">}</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the preceding code snippet, we have added references to the <kbd>TextView</kbd> and <kbd>Button</kbd> elements present in our <kbd>activity_hello</kbd> layout file by utilizing the <kbd>findViewById</kbd> function. The <kbd>findViewById</kbd> function can be used to get references to layout elements that are within the currently-set content view. The second line of the <kbd>onCreate</kbd> function has set the content view of <kbd>HelloActivity</kbd> to the <kbd>activity_hello.xml</kbd> layout.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next to the <kbd>findViewById</kbd> function identifier, we have the <kbd>TextView</kbd> type written between two angular brackets. This is called a function generic. It is being used to enforce that the resource ID being passed to the <kbd>findViewById</kbd> belongs to a <kbd>TextView</kbd> element.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After adding our reference objects, we set an <kbd>onClickListener</kbd> to <kbd>btnClickMe</kbd>. Listeners are used to listen for the occurrence of events within an application. In order to perform an action upon the click of an element, we pass a lambda containing the action to be performed to the element's <kbd>setOnClickListener</kbd> method.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When <kbd>btnClickMe</kbd> is clicked, <kbd>tvGreeting</kbd> is checked to see whether it has been set to contain any text. If no text has been set to the <kbd>TextView</kbd>, then its text is set to <kbd>Hello World!</kbd>, otherwise a toast is displayed with the&#160;<kbd>I have been clicked!</kbd>&#160;text.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The web is a complex system of interconnected systems possessing the ability to communicate with other systems existing on a common network via one or more protocols. A protocol is an official, well-defined system of rules governing the exchange of information between devices.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All communications over the web are made in accordance with a protocol. A particularly important protocol&#160;for fostering communication between systems is the <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong>HTTP</strong>).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Billions of images, videos, text files, documents, and other files are transferred across the internet on a daily basis. These files are all transferred through HTTP. HTTP is an application protocol for distributed and hypermedia information systems. It can be said to be a foundational component for communication across the internet. A major benefit of using HTTP for data transfer across systems is that it is highly reliable. This is as a result of its utilization of reliable protocols, such as the <strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (<strong>TCP</strong>) and <strong>Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong>IP</strong>).</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A web client is any application that communicates with a web server utilizing HTTP. A web server is a computer that provides – or serves – web resources to web clients. A web resource is anything that provides web content. A web resource can be a media file, an HTML document, a gateway, and so on. Clients need web content for various purposes, such as information rendering and data manipulation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Clients and servers communicate with each other via HTTP. One major reason for the utilization of HTTP is the fact that it is extremely reliable in data transmission. The use of HTTP ensures data loss does not occur in a request-response cycle.</span></p>
