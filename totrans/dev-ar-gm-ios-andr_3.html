To do that, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Asset</strong></span> menu<a id="id100" class="indexterm"/> in the menu bar, then inside <span class="strong"><strong>Import package ...</strong></span>, click on <span class="strong"><strong>custom package</strong></span>. This is exactly the same way we imported the sample project from Vuforia to our project.</p><p>Now find where Vuforia SDK was installed and choose the Vuforia Unity package to be imported into the project. The following screenshot shows the importing of a Vuforia package:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_2.jpg" alt="Creating a Unity project with Vuforia"/></div><p>Now that the entire Vuforia library has been added to the project, we can start looking at the components that comes with it. All that makes a Vuforia project is within the <span class="strong"><strong>Qualcomm Augmented Reality</strong></span> folder inside the project. This folder will contain all the scripts that control the behavior <a id="id101" class="indexterm"/>of the AR experience. Not only<a id="id102" class="indexterm"/> scripts, but some shaders and textures as well. They are mainly used for the video background rendering of the AR app.</p><p>Fortunately, we don't have to deal directly with most of those scripts, as Vuforia bundles the necessary components in Unity prefabs ready to be dropped into the scene.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Vuforia prefabs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec21"/>Vuforia prefabs</h1></div></div></div><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>prefab</strong></span> is essentially a type of asset that is created in Unity to be a reusable game object stored in Project view. Prefabs can be inserted as many times as we want into the scene and with any <a id="id103" class="indexterm"/>object transformation applied to it. When added to the scene, they are basically an instance of the original prefab and linked to it. When a change<a id="id104" class="indexterm"/> is applied to the original prefab, all its instances will copy it, as they are essentially clones of it.</p><p>Prefabs are an indispensable tool for Unity. It makes the creation of standard scene components a much easier task. Imagine we are making a game with many enemy non-player characters. It will take a lot of time to manually construct every one of them, but if we create a single enemy prefab and then clone it multiple times, it will make constructing the scene much easier. Also if we want to edit the entire enemy NPCs, we only have to edit the prefab and the change will propagate.</p><p>Unity prefabs also make it easier to share components between projects if they are to be exported into Unity packages. This is essentially what Qualcomm did with Vuforia components. All the components that make the AR scene are stored as prefabs that are ready to be dropped into the scene; we only needs its parameters adjusted.</p><p>All Vuforia prefabs can be found inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Prefabs</strong></span> folder inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Qualcomm Augmented Reality</strong></span> folder. The following screenshot shows the <span class="strong"><strong>Qualcomm Augmented Reality Prefabs</strong></span> folder:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_3.jpg" alt="Vuforia prefabs"/></div><p>Inside the <span class="strong"><strong>Prefabs</strong></span> folder, we will find all the components explained before such as the <span class="strong"><strong>ImageTarget</strong></span> prefab and the <span class="strong"><strong>FrameMarker</strong></span> prefab. We will also find the <span class="strong"><strong>ARCamera</strong></span> prefab, which is the common thing among any type of AR app.</p><p>By default, when<a id="id105" class="indexterm"/> Unity creates a new scene, it adds a camera to the scene such as the one in the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel. In our case, we will use Vuforia's special <span class="strong"><strong>ARCamera</strong></span> prefab in our scene. So we need to first delete the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> object from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel.</p><p>Simply select the <span class="strong"><strong>Main Camera</strong></span> from the scene <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> and right click on it, then click on <span class="strong"><strong>Delete</strong></span>. Now drag-and-drop the <span class="strong"><strong>ARCamera</strong></span> prefab to the scene. Anywhere on the scene is fine. Now to focus on its position, select the <span class="strong"><strong>ARCamera</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel and hold the <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> keyboard key till the focus is on it. When holding the <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> key, make sure the mouse pointer is over the scene panel, or the focus will not work. The following screenshot shows <span class="strong"><strong>ARCamera</strong></span> prefab added to the scene:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_4.jpg" alt="Vuforia prefabs"/></div><p>Adding the rest of the components is just as easy. Now that we have an <span class="strong"><strong>ARCamera</strong></span> prefab added to<a id="id106" class="indexterm"/> the scene, we just need to add the <span class="strong"><strong>ImageTarget</strong></span> prefab to the scene as well. Drag and drop the <span class="strong"><strong>ImageTarget</strong></span> prefab anywhere on the scene.</p><p>This prefab is the platform that we will add the 3D content to. It will also hold the image target that the app will track to orient <code class="literal">ARCamera</code> the way we saw in the sample app. The following screenshot shows<a id="id107" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>ImageTarget</strong></span> prefab added to the scene:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_5.jpg" alt="Vuforia prefabs"/></div><p>Depending on where the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code> prefab was dropped in the scene, its position in the game world displayed in the transform section will differ. <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> is basically the position of the game object in the game world. Transform holds three different vectors for three different data about<a id="id108" class="indexterm"/> the position of the object. That data is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Position</strong></span>: This is the position of the object in the three axes, x, y, and z</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Rotation</strong></span>: This<a id="id109" class="indexterm"/> is the rotation of the object in the three axes , x, y, and z</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span>: This is the size scale of the object compared to its original size in the game world</li></ul></div><p>Objects can be anywhere in the world, but it is recommended to keep the world's floor at <span class="emphasis"><em>y=0</em></span>. By keeping the floor to <code class="literal">0</code>, it simplifies a lot of other aspects of code when it comes to changing the transformation of object through scripts. So now change all the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code>'s position to be (<span class="emphasis"><em>x=0</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>y=0</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>z=0</em></span>). This will position the object in the origin of the world and simplifies the position aspect of subsequent game objects. The following screenshot shows the image target inspector:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_6.jpg" alt="Vuforia prefabs"/></div><p>As it is noticeable from the inspector, there are a lot of settings for Image Target that might seem intimidating at first. One of those components is named <span class="strong"><strong>Image Target Behaviour (Script)</strong></span>, which is highlighted in the image above; this is responsible for attaching the image target data to the image target object. Right now, it has no target defined in the app because we haven't added any yet, hence the white representation of the image target.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is to add the image target's data into the app. We do that by importing the dataset's Unity package that is available with the book content by the name <code class="literal">exampleDataset.unitypackage</code>. Import the package in the same way we imported all the other Unity packages. The following screenshot shows <span class="strong"><strong>exampleDataset.unityPackage</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_7.jpg" alt="Vuforia prefabs"/></div><p>What this package essentially contains is the data of the target image that Vuforia's tracking algorithm can<a id="id110" class="indexterm"/> effectively look for from the camera's feed. It also carries a texture representation of the target image to be viewed inside Unity's editor while developing the app.</p><p>Now that the project contains the tracking data, a new selection will appear inside the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code> prefab for the <span class="strong"><strong>Image Target Behaviour</strong></span>. We will be able to select any of the images imported from the target package and the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code> prefab will instantly adopt it.</p><p>First we need to select the dataset that contains the images. From the dropdown menu, we can select the only dataset available, named <span class="strong"><strong>exampleDataset</strong></span>. From the dropdown menu below, we can choose the specific target image. Choose the target image stones. Notice immediately the <span class="strong"><strong>ImageTarget</strong></span> representation in the game world carries now the target image. The following screenshot shows the dataset selection:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_8.jpg" alt="Vuforia prefabs"/></div><p>Datasets are essentially a collection of image targets that Vuforia will track simultaneously for any<a id="id111" class="indexterm"/> of the images inside it. Inside the dataset that we imported, we have images images from the Vuforia sample project. The app will track all three images at any given time till it finds any of the images to render the 3D material on top of it.</p><p>The app can have multiple datasets with as many as 100 images in each one of them. That is a substantial number of images that Vuforia can track. We also have the ability to activate and deactivate any of the datasets from the editor or from script.</p><p>When we added the dataset to the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code>, it represented the image target in the world right away, but that doesn't necessarily mean that <code class="literal">ARCamera</code> will be tracking that dataset. For that, we need to first activate the dataset and tell the <code class="literal">ARCamera</code> to start tracking that dataset.</p><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>ARCamera</strong></span> object from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel. In the inspector, we can find the <span class="strong"><strong>Script</strong></span> component <span class="strong"><strong>Data Set Load Behaviour (Script)</strong></span>. Inside the component, there will be one checkbox with the label <span class="strong"><strong>Load Data Set exampleDataset</strong></span>. If we click on the checkbox, another one will appear with the label <span class="strong"><strong>Activate</strong></span>. Click on that as well. Now the dataset is loaded and activated. The following screenshot shows the activated dataset in <span class="strong"><strong>ARCamera</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_9.jpg" alt="Vuforia prefabs"/></div><p>There is a particular reason why we need to both load and activate the datasets as separate options. The datasets will be<a id="id112" class="indexterm"/> loaded but not necessarily tracked at the start of the scene if added to the <code class="literal">ARCamera</code> component. From script, we can then enable and disable tracking for any of them without the need for loading overhead. The process is very fast that way.</p><p>Now we know that Vuforia both knows what trackables to track and is actively tracking them. We added the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code> prefab and set it to the <span class="strong"><strong>Stones</strong></span> image target. If we are to press play and present the camera with the stones image target, nothing will happen beyond a console log declaring it has detected the image target. We might even notice the <code class="literal">ARCamera</code> frantically moving around the game world in relation to the image target in the editor. That is simply because we do not have any 3D content attached to the target image just yet.</p><div class="section" title="Importing and attaching 3D objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec10"/>Importing and attaching 3D objects</h2></div></div></div><p>Unity is capable of<a id="id113" class="indexterm"/> importing 3D models from many well-established formats. Models can be created from any of the 3D modeling applications such as 3D<a id="id114" class="indexterm"/> max, Maya, and Blender. As long as the model is exported in a Unity-supported format, it is easily imported into the project.</p><p>Formats supported by<a id="id115" class="indexterm"/> Unity are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Maya (<code class="literal">.mb</code> and <code class="literal">.ma</code>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">3D Studio Max (<code class="literal">.max</code>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Cheetah 3D (<code class="literal">.jas</code>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Cinema 4D (<code class="literal">.c4d</code>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Blender (<code class="literal">.blend</code>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Modo (<code class="literal">.lxo</code>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Autodesk<a id="id116" class="indexterm"/> (<code class="literal">.fbx</code>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">COLLADA</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Carrara</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Lightwave</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">XSI 5.x</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">SketchUp Pro</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Wings 3D</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">3D studio (<code class="literal">.3ds</code>, does not work on Mac OSX)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Wavefront (<code class="literal">.obj</code>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Drawing Interchange Files (<code class="literal">.dxf</code>)</li></ul></div><p>The list is quite extensive. It is quite safe to assume that Unity will support most known 3D model formats. <a id="id117" class="indexterm"/>Notice though that Unity uses the 3D modeling application to convert the model format to FBX, which then can be imported by Unity. This process is mostly automatic and <a id="id118" class="indexterm"/>produces smooth results and streamlines the workflow considerably.</p><p>Now it's time to add our own 3D model to the project. Firstly, we need to create a folder for models in our project. We will use it to include all models in our project. In the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> root folder, create a folder and name it <code class="literal">Models</code>.</p><p>Importing assets is easily done from the <span class="strong"><strong>Assets</strong></span> menu at the top. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Import New Asset</strong></span> from the menu, and point at the chapter's assets folder and choose <code class="literal">frog.fbx</code> file. Unity will start importing the asset right away. The following screenshot shows Unity imported <span class="strong"><strong>Frog</strong></span> asset:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_10.jpg" alt="Importing and attaching 3D objects"/></div><p>Now we have the 3D model in our project, it is that easy to add models to Unity projects. That is good news because for a game engine, adding models is one of the top chores done in projects. Are you wondering why the 3D model is a frog? It is because it's generally good for<a id="id119" class="indexterm"/> developers to have a sense of humor; it helps.</p><p>When importing <a id="id120" class="indexterm"/>the 3D model, it created two folders and one file for us. The folders contain materials for the 3D model and settings for the FBX import. The file is actually a Unity prefab of the model with the materials attached ready to be dropped to the scene. Unity creates the prefab automatically for us.</p><p>Now we can drag the <a id="id121" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Frog</strong></span> prefab and drop it in our scene. The frog 3D model will appear in our game world. The following screenshot shows the frog model added to the scene:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_11.jpg" alt="Importing and attaching 3D objects"/></div><p>Just as when we<a id="id122" class="indexterm"/> added the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code> prefab, the frog's position in the scene is almost certainly not right. We need to position it on top of the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code> and for it to face the right way, but<a id="id123" class="indexterm"/> first we need to approximate its position in relation to the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code> better. Remember when we added the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code>; we positioned it at the game world's origin at <code class="literal">(0,0,0)</code> position. We will do the same for the frog as a first step.</p><p>Select the frog from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span>, and from the inspector panel in <span class="strong"><strong>Transform</strong></span> position, set x, y and z to zero. The following screenshot shows the frog position at the origin point:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_12.jpg" alt="Importing and attaching 3D objects"/></div><p>The first thing to notice wrong with the frog is that it is sunk in the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code>. The other problem is that it is too small for the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code>.</p><p>First we will try<a id="id124" class="indexterm"/> to position the frog above the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code>. At the top left of Unity, make sure that you have the directional cross button selected. This allows us to change the position of the selected object. Notice the green, blue, and red axes coming out of the frog. They are<a id="id125" class="indexterm"/> the relative position of the object in the game world. Green is for the y axis, red for the x axis, and blue for the z axis. We will want to move the object in the y axis to get it above the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code>. To do that, simply drag the green axis and move the mouse up; the object will move up with it.</p><p>Position the frog anywhere above the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code>. It doesn't have to be perfect for now. The following screenshot shows the frog positioned higher in the y axis:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_13.jpg" alt="Importing and attaching 3D objects"/></div><p>Now for the second problem, its size; we will need to scale it up considerably to fit the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code>.</p><p>While the frog is selected from the scene, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Scale</strong></span> button from the top left menu. It is the last icon on the right of a square with arrows coming out of it.</p><p>The scaling button allows us to scale the object in the scene on any axis or all axes. Since we need the object to scale in every direction equally to avoid the frog being stretched in one direction more than the other, we need to click on the square at the origin of the three axes now represented on the object, and then drag the mouse over it. The following screenshot shows the scaled up the frog object:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_14.jpg" alt="Importing and attaching 3D objects"/></div><p>Scaling up to <code class="literal">10</code> in the inspector should be sufficient, but since there are no constraints, we can make it as<a id="id126" class="indexterm"/> big or as small as we want it to be.</p><p>Now, we need to <a id="id127" class="indexterm"/>make the frog face the right way, opposite to where it's facing right now. To do that we need to activate the Rotation button in the top left menu.</p><p>Once the Rotation button is activated, the axes over the object will look quite different. For a start they are spherical in nature, and there are more than just the (x, y, and z) axes.</p><p>Rotation functions in a similar manner, despite the different look to the other transformation tools. By dragging on the (x, y, and z) axes, we can rotate the object around any of the three axes. The remaining white axes are diagonal rotations for easy access.</p><p>Drag the green y axis to rotate the object to face the right way. Notice the rotation data in the inspector changing around the y axis. We need it to be around <code class="literal">180</code> or <code class="literal">-180</code> degrees. Note that we can just input that number in the rotation section of the inspector to reach the same result. The following screenshot shows the rotated frog object:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_15.jpg" alt="Importing and attaching 3D objects"/></div><p>Now that the frog is rotated to face the right way in relation to the trackable, we only need to position it<a id="id128" class="indexterm"/> higher up to be right on top of the trackable. We can achieve that in the same way we positioned the frog before. Only this time with more care and we must rotate the editor<a id="id129" class="indexterm"/> camera several times to make sure the frog is positioned from all angles correctly. The following screenshot shows correctly the positioned frog:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_16.jpg" alt="Importing and attaching 3D objects"/></div><p>Now the frog is positioned perfectly fine on top of the image target, all is good. You would notice, though, that the frog seems to have dull colors. That is mainly due to the lack of any light sources in the scene; this is what we are going to add next.</p><p>From the top menu, choose <span class="strong"><strong>GameObject</strong></span>. From the menu click on <span class="strong"><strong>Directional Light</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>Create Other</strong></span> menu. This adds an object called Directional Light to your scene. The following screenshot shows<a id="id130" class="indexterm"/> Directional Light added to scene:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_17.jpg" alt="Importing and attaching 3D objects"/></div><p>Directional Light<a id="id131" class="indexterm"/> is a type of scene light that is quite easy to add and cheap on device resources. It essentially acts like a sun, lighting up any object in the direction you point it at. All we need to<a id="id132" class="indexterm"/> do is adjust the object's rotation. Its position in the game world doesn't mean much, because its light is only based on its direction, not its position.</p><p>Now the frog is where we want it to be, and looking good. We might be tempted to press the <span class="strong"><strong>Play Button</strong></span> now and test the AR experience. If we do that and present the camera with the trackable, the frog will appear correctly. But once the trackable is lost to the camera, we will find that the frog remains on the screen regardless. This happens because we did not parent the frog with the image target.</p></div><div class="section" title="Parenting in Unity objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec11"/>Parenting in Unity objects</h2></div></div></div><p>There is a good reason Unity's <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel is named that way. That is because it represents the object's hierarchy in the scene. If we are to click on the arrow next to the frog object in the<a id="id133" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel, it will reveal a number of objects below it. These objects are essentially children of the object frog.</p><p>The parent object<a id="id134" class="indexterm"/> frog contains many children under it in <span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> that essentially means that the children's transformation will follow that of the parent. When we moved the frog object around, we didn't have to individually move the children as we did so; they automatically moved with the parent object. That is fortunate because it would have consumed a lot of time to do that.</p><p>Parenting in Unity happens for a number of reasons. Whether it's script access, transformation, or simple grouping, Unity parenting is a very important feature.</p><p>For image targets<a id="id135" class="indexterm"/> to work correctly, we must parent them over any 3D content they will display. This is a must for Vuforia to be able to control when and how the 3D content is shown to match that of the image target.</p><p>To parent it, we simply need to drag the frog object and drop it over the <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code> object in the <a id="id136" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></span> panel. The following screenshot shows the parented frog object:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0032_3_17.jpg" alt="Parenting in Unity objects"/></div><p>With that our AR project should be functional and displays the frog correctly once we click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Play Button</strong></span> to test it. We can deploy it on the device if we follow the settings explained in the previous chapter.</p><p>Through this chapter, we have learned how to build a Vuforia project from scratch in Unity, how to import and present our 3D objects, and how to add and set up Vuforia components to correctly display it.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec22"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we started our new Unity project that we added Vuforia SDK to. We were introduced to the meaning of the term prefab and then explored the different prefabs that are packaged inside Vuforia SDK. We saw how to build up an AR scene using Vuforia prefabs, especially the <code class="literal">ARCamera</code> prefab and <code class="literal">ImageTarget</code> prefab. We then understood the method in which we add targets to the project and how to activate those datasets in our project. We also saw how easy it is to add a 3D model to a Unity project and position it in our scene however we like and add appropriate lightening.</p><p>Next chapter, we will see how to create our own target datasets in the target manager, and understand how to obtain the best targeting results from the images we choose.</p></div></body></html>
