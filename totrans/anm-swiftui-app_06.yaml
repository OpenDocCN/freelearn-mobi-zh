    image, specifically an image of a girl on a swing, and make those individual parts
    move with a natural motion.

    image or vector file of a subject and then cuts that image up into various parts
    in order to animate them separately. We will also take a look at a new modifier

    however, that can be expensive. Instead, you can try my favorite image editing
    software that I mentioned earlier, Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo. They
    are very reasonably priced and as robust as Photoshop, but they are much more
    user-friendly. Definitely take a look at them if you want to learn how to manipulate

    you would for Photoshop.

    image can extend to the edges of an iPhone of any size.

    want to display; here, it’s `"leg"`. Remember, we are using this one image to
    represent the right and left legs (we can get away with using a single image because
    this is a 2D scene; we don’t have a 3D view around the image, so we can’t really
    see any variance in each leg).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we will use the `resizable` modifier and set the aspect ratio to `fit`.
    Using the `fit` option resizes the image content to use all the available screen
    space, both vertically and horizontally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next line of code sets the `rotationEffect` on the leg. The right leg will
    be rotated by `-20` degrees when the `rightLeg` property is `true`, and it will
    rotate `50` degrees when it is `false`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notice the `anchor` parameter too? An anchor point is the point around which
    the image will rotate. When thinking about humans (and animals too), our anchor
    points are our joints. We bend and move from those joints, our pivot points. In
    our project, by using the `topTrailing` option, the leg will rotate about the
    knee joint.

    too big for the screen, so by using the `scaleEffect` modifier, we have scaled
    it down to 12 percent of its original size. For our scene, that’s a nice fit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next line of code uses the `offset` modifier to place the right leg in the
    exact location we need. It needs to be placed at the knee joint of the girl image,
    which I worked out to be a value of -448 for the *x*-axis and 92 for the *y*-axis.
    Arriving at those coordinates is really just a matter of trial and error. For
    example, if you want to move the part up on the screen, add a smaller number for
    the *y* position, and if you want to move the image to right, add a larger number
    for the *x* position.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we get to the animation, most of which we have seen before. Here, the
    `animation` modifier does the work of moving the leg, with a `duration` of 1 second,
    which is the time it takes for the animation to finish. Also, using a slight `delay`
    of `.09` seconds will give a more random look to the animation as we will set
    the left leg to a different delay.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As well as this, we want the animation to repeat forever, or at least until
    the user stops the app, so that’s why the `repeatForever` function is used. The
    `autoReverse` parameter has a value of `true` because we want the animation to
    go forward in one direction, finish, reverse itself, and continue in the opposite
    direction. Also, the `animation` modifier needs a property for its `value` parameter,
    and for that, we pass the `rightLeg` property into it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final part of this code is the `onAppear` modifier. This modifier is used
    to run code when the view appears on the screen, hence the name `onAppear`. In
    `body`, we toggle the `rightLeg` property to `true` to activate the animation.
  prefs: []

    the look we are going for, so let’s add the girl now, followed by the left leg.

    which will scale the image down to fit in the scene, and `offset` to place the
    girl image in the correct position on the *x*-and *y*-axes (using values of `-300`

    property for this leg is `0.4` and the `delay` property is `1` second. As I mentioned
    earlier, by adding different durations and delays from the other images, we can
    randomize the swinging effect a little bit so that the legs don’t both go up and
    down together. This will give the animation a more natural swinging motion.

    to pass in our rope image and setting the aspect ratio to `fit`. But what is new
    here is that we’re using the `mask` modifier. The `mask` modifier applies a masking
    view to the view it’s called on. The masking view defines the visible area of
    the view it is applied to, and any parts of the view that fall outside of the
    masking view’s frame will not be visible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `mask` modifier takes a single parameter, which is the view that will be
    used as the mask. If we pass in `gradient` as we’re doing here, we can gradually
    fade out the rope as it extends upward. This is where the `LinearGradient` function
    and our `fadeOutRope` property come into play; the latter contains an array of
    gradient colors (two colors actually, clear and black) that we pass into the `LinearGradient`
    function.

- en: We also need to consider the `startPoint` (where you want to start blending
    in the next color) and the `endPoint` (where you want to end one color and start

    the rope image, and `endPoint` is at the bottom of the rope image. The reason
    why we want the start point at the top is so that it will have a clear color so
    we can fade out the rope as it moves upward.

- en: In this project, we learned how to take an image and cut out various parts at
    the joints, use those new images in code, and animate them in different and interesting
    ways. We also worked with modifiers that we have worked with before, including
    `rotation`, `scale`, and `offset`, but also a new modifier, `mask`.

    whether you can cut the arms and head from the picture, and then give them some
    animation as well. Play around with the parameters so you can make each part move
    just enough to look natural. Maybe you can make the arms pivot at the elbow just
    slightly as the swing moves forward and backward. Add a button if you want so
    you can start and stop the animation that way. Mainly, just experiment and have
    fun!

    *y*, and *z*, and create an animation that will rotate a fan using gears and chains,
    similar to a bicycle chain that turns its gears.
