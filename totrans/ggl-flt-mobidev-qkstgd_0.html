                    <h1 class="header-title">Conventions used</h1>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in the text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>void main() {<br/>debugPaintSizeEnabled=true;<br/>runApp(MyApp());<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre> <span class="fontstyle0">Center(<br/>child: Container(<br/><strong>decoration: BoxDecoration(border: Border.all()),</strong><br/>height: 200.0,<br/>width: 200.0,<br/>),<br/>),</span> </pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ flutter packages get</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
