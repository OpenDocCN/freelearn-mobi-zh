</p><p>This chapter references many Internet pages that are not under our control. Here, we do show screenshots or URLs, so remember that the content may have changed since we wrote this. The suppliers may also have changed some of the details, but in general, our description of procedures should still work the way we have described them.</p></div><p>Here we go...</p><div class="section" title="iOS, Android, or both?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec20"/>iOS, Android, or both?</h1></div></div></div><p>It could be that you only have interest in iOS or Android. You should be able to easily skip to the sections you're interested in unless you're intrigued about how the other half works! If, like me, you're a capitalist, then you should be interested in both the operating systems.</p><p>Far fewer steps are needed to get the Android SDK than the iOS developer tools because for iOS, we have to sign up as a developer with Apple. However, the configuration for Android is more involved. We'll go through all the steps for Android and then the ones for iOS. If you're an iOS-only kind of person, skip the next few pages and start up again at the <span class="emphasis"><em>Becoming an iOS Developer</em></span> section.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Becoming an Android developer"><div class="titlepage" id="aid-PNV62"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec21"/>Becoming an Android developer</h1></div></div></div><p>It is possible to develop <a id="id87" class="indexterm"/>Android OS apps without signing up for anything. We'll try to be optimistic and assume that within the next 12 months, you will find time to make an awesome app that will make you rich! To that end, we'll go over everything that is involved in the process of signing up to publish your apps in both Google Play (formally known as Android Market) and Amazon Appstore.</p><div class="section" title="Google Play"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec31"/>Google Play</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id88" class="indexterm"/>starting location to open Google Play is <a class="ulink" href="http://developer.android.com/">http://developer.android.com/</a>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00235.jpeg" alt="Google Play"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>We will come <a id="id89" class="indexterm"/>back to this page again, shortly to download the Android SDK, but for now, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Distribute</strong></span> link in the menu bar and then on the <span class="strong"><strong>Developer Console</strong></span> button on the following screen. Since Google changes these pages occasionally, you can use the URL <a class="ulink" href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">https://play.google.com/apps/publish/</a> or search for "Google Play <a id="id90" class="indexterm"/>Developer Console". The screens you will progress through are not shown here since they tend to change with time.</p><p>There will be a sign-in page; sign in using your usual Google details.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Which e-mail address to use?</strong></span>
</p><p>Some Google services are easier to sign up for if you have a Gmail account. Creating a Google+ account, or signing up for some of their cloud services, requires a Gmail address (or so it seemed to me at the time!). If you have previously set up Google Wallet as part of your account, some of the steps in signing up become simpler. So, use your Gmail address and if you don't have one, create one!</p></div><p>Google charges you a $25 fee to sign up for Google Play. At least now, you know about this! Enter the developer name, e-mail address, website URL (if you have one), and your phone number. The payment of $25 will be done through Google Wallet, which will save you from entering the billing details yet again.</p><p>Now, you're all signed <a id="id91" class="indexterm"/>up and ready to make your fortune!</p></div><div class="section" title="Amazon Appstore"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec32"/>Amazon Appstore</h2></div></div></div><p>Although the rules and <a id="id92" class="indexterm"/>costs for Google Play are fairly relaxed, Amazon has a more Apple-like approach, both in the amount they charge you to register and <a id="id93" class="indexterm"/>in the review process to accept app submissions. The URL to <a id="id94" class="indexterm"/>open Amazon Appstore is <a class="ulink" href="http://developer.amazon.com/public">http://developer.amazon.com/public</a>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00236.jpeg" alt="Amazon Appstore"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Follow these steps to start with Amazon Appstore:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">When you select <span class="strong"><strong>Get Started</strong></span>, you need to sign in to your Amazon account.<div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip06"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Which email address to use?</strong></span>
</p><p>This feels like déjà vu! There is no real advantage of using your Google e-mail address when signing up for the Amazon Appstore Developer Program, but if you happen to have an account with Amazon, sign in with that one. It will simplify the payment stage, and your developer account and the general Amazon account will be associated with each other.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">You are then asked <a id="id95" class="indexterm"/>to agree to the Appstore Distribution Agreement terms before learning about the costs.</li><li class="listitem">These costs are $99 <a id="id96" class="indexterm"/>per year, but the first year is free.

If you intend to make native Java-based applications, you may be interested in reading through all the <a id="id100" class="indexterm"/>steps that are described in the web page <a class="ulink" href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html">http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html</a>.</p></div><p>Click on the SDK <a id="id101" class="indexterm"/>download link for your platform. Note that you don't need the ADT Bundle unless you plan to develop outside the LiveCode <a id="id102" class="indexterm"/>IDE. The steps you'll have to go through are different for Mac and Windows. Let's start with Mac.</p><div class="section" title="Installing the Android SDK on Mac OS X (Intel)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec01"/>Installing the Android SDK on Mac OS X (Intel)</h3></div></div></div><p>LiveCode <a id="id103" class="indexterm"/>itself doesn't require Intel Mac; you can develop stacks using a PowerPC-based Mac, but both the Android SDK and some of the <a id="id104" class="indexterm"/>iOS tools require an Intel-based Mac, which sadly means that if you're reading this as you sit next to your Mac G4 or G5, you're not going to get too far!</p><p>The Android SDK requires the <span class="strong"><strong>Java Runtime Environment</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>JRE</strong></span>). Since Apple stopped including the <a id="id105" class="indexterm"/>JRE in more recent OS X systems, you should check whether you have it in your system by typing <code class="literal">java –version</code> in a Terminal window. The terminal will display the version of Java installed. If not, you may get a message like the following:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00238.jpeg" alt="Installing the Android SDK on Mac OS X (Intel)"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>More Info</strong></span> button and follow the instructions to install the JRE and verify its installation. At the time of writing this book, JRE 8 doesn't work with OS X 10.10 and I had to use the JRE 6 <a id="id106" class="indexterm"/>obtained from <a class="ulink" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572">http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572</a>.</p><p>The file that you just downloaded will automatically expand to show a folder named <code class="literal">android-sdk-macosx</code>. It may be in your <code class="literal">downloads</code> folder right now, but a more natural place for it would be in your <code class="literal">Documents</code> folder, so move it there before performing the next steps.</p><p>There is an SDK readme text file that lists the steps you need to follow during the installation. If these steps are different to what we have here, then follow the steps in the readme file in case they have been updated since the procedure here was written.</p><p>Open the <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span> application, which is in <span class="strong"><strong>Applications/Utilities</strong></span>. You need to change the default directories present in the <code class="literal">android-sdk-macosx</code> folder. One handy trick, using Terminal, is that you can drag items into the Terminal window to get the file path to that item. Using this trick, you can type <code class="literal">cd</code> and a space in the Terminal window and then drag the <code class="literal">android-sdk-macosx</code> <a id="id107" class="indexterm"/>folder after the space character. You'll end up with this line if your username is Fred:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>new-host-3:~ fred$ cd /Users/fred/Documents/android-sdk-macosx</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Of course, the first part of the line and the user folder will match yours, not Fred's!</p><p>Whatever your name is, press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Return</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> key after entering the preceding line. The location line now changes to look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>new-host-3:android-sdk-macosx colin$</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Either carefully type or copy and paste the following line from the readme file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>tools/android update sdk --no-ui</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Press <span class="emphasis"><em>Return</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> again. How long the file takes to get downloaded depends on your Internet connection. Even with a very fast Internet connection, it could still take over an hour.</p><p>If you care to follow the <a id="id108" class="indexterm"/>update progress, you can just run the <code class="literal">android</code> file in the <code class="literal">tools</code> directory. This will open the Android SDK Manager, which is similar to the Windows version shown a couple of pages further on in this book.</p></div><div class="section" title="Installing the Android SDK on Windows"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec02"/>Installing the Android SDK on Windows</h3></div></div></div><p>The downloads page <a id="id109" class="indexterm"/>recommends that you use the <code class="literal">.exe</code> download link, as it gives extra services to you, such as checking whether you have the <span class="strong"><strong>Java Development Kit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>JDK</strong></span>) installed. When you click on the link, either use the <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> <a id="id110" class="indexterm"/>options, as you would with any download of a Windows installer. Here, we've opted to use <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span>; if you use <span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span>, then you need to open the file after it has been saved to your hard drive. In the following case, as the JDK wasn't installed, a dialog box appears saying go to Oracle's site to get the JDK:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00239.jpeg" alt="Installing the Android SDK on Windows"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>If you see this screen too, you can leave the dialog box open and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Visit java.oracle.com</strong></span> button. On the Oracle page, click on a checkbox to agree to their terms and then on the download link that corresponds with your platform. Choose the 64-bit option if you are running a 64-bit version of Windows or the x86 option if you are running a 32-bit version of Windows.</p><p>Either way, you're <a id="id111" class="indexterm"/>greeted with another installer that you can Run or Save as you prefer. Naturally, it takes a while for the installer to do its thing too! When the installation is complete, you will see a JDK registration page and it's up to you, to register or not.</p><p>Back at the Android SDK <a id="id112" class="indexterm"/>installer dialog box, you can click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Back</strong></span> button and then the <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> button to get back to the JDK checking stage; only now, it sees that you have the JDK installed. Complete the remaining steps of the SDK installer as you would with any Windows installer.</p><p>One important thing to note is that the last screen of the installer offers to open the SDK Manager. You should do that, so resist the temptation to uncheck that box!</p><p>Click on Finish and you'll be greeted with a command-line window for a few moments, as shown in the following screenshot, and then, the Android SDK Manager will appear and do its thing:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00240.jpeg" alt="Installing the Android SDK on Windows"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>As with the Mac <a id="id113" class="indexterm"/>version, it takes a very long time for all these <a id="id114" class="indexterm"/>add-ons to download.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Pointing LiveCode to the Android SDK"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec35"/>Pointing LiveCode to the Android SDK</h2></div></div></div><p>After all the <a id="id115" class="indexterm"/>installation and <a id="id116" class="indexterm"/>command-line work, it's a refreshing change to <a id="id117" class="indexterm"/>get back to LiveCode!</p><p>Open the <span class="strong"><strong>LiveCode Preferences</strong></span> and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Mobile Support</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00241.jpeg" alt="Pointing LiveCode to the Android SDK"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>We will set the <a id="id118" class="indexterm"/>two iOS entries after we get <a id="id119" class="indexterm"/>iOS going (but these options will be grayed <a id="id120" class="indexterm"/>out in Windows). For now, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>…</strong></span> button next to the Android development SDK root field and navigate to where the SDK is installed. If you've followed the earlier steps correctly, then the SDK will be in the <code class="literal">Documents</code> folder on Mac or you can navigate to <code class="literal">C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\</code> to find it on Windows (or somewhere else, if you choose to use a custom location).</p><p>Depending on the APIs that were loaded in the SDK Manager, you may get a message that the path does not include support for Android 2.2 (API 8). If so, use the Android SDK Manager to install it. LiveCode seems to want API 8 even though at this time Android 5.0 uses API 21.</p><p>Phew! Now, let's do the same for iOS…</p></div><div class="section" title="Pop quiz – tasty code names"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec36"/>Pop quiz – tasty code names</h2></div></div></div><p>An Android OS <a id="id121" class="indexterm"/>uses some curious code names for each version. At the time of writing this book, we were on Android OS 5, which had a code name of Lollipop. Version 4.1 was Jelly Bean and version 4.4 was KitKat.

<div class="section" title="Becoming an iOS developer"><div class="titlepage" id="aid-QMFO2"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec22"/>Becoming an iOS developer</h1></div></div></div><p>Creating iOS LiveCode <a id="id122" class="indexterm"/>applications requires that LiveCode must have access to the iOS SDK. This is installed as part of the Xcode developer tools and is a Mac-only program. Also, when you upload an app to the iOS App Store, the application used is Mac only and is part of the Xcode installation. If you are a Windows-based developer and wish to develop and publish for iOS, you need either an actual Mac based system or a virtual machine that can run the Mac OS. We can even use VirtualBox for <a id="id123" class="indexterm"/>running a Mac based virtual machine, but performance will be an issue. Refer to <a class="ulink" href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63147/is-mac-os-x-in-a-virtualbox-vm-suitable-for-ios-development">http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63147/is-mac-os-x-in-a-virtualbox-vm-suitable-for-ios-development</a> for more information.</p><p>The biggest difference between becoming an Android developer and becoming an iOS developer is that you have to sign up with Apple for their developer program even if you never produce an app for the iOS App Store, but no such signing up is required when becoming an Android developer. If things go well and you end up making an app for various stores, then this isn't such a big deal. It will cost you $25 to submit an app to the Android Market, $99 a year (with the first year free) to submit an app to the Amazon Appstore, and $99 a year (including the first year) to be an iOS developer with Apple. Just try to sell more than 300 copies of your amazing $0.99 app and you'll find that it has paid for itself!</p><p>Note that there is a free iOS App Store and app licensing included, with LiveCode Membership, which also costs $99 per year. As a LiveCode member, you can submit your free non-commercial app to RunRev who will provide a license that will allow you to submit your app as "closed source" to iOS App Store. This service is exclusively available for LiveCode members. The first submission each year is free; after that, there is a $25 administration <a id="id124" class="indexterm"/>fee per submission. Refer to <a class="ulink" href="http://livecode.com/membership/">http://livecode.com/membership/</a> for more information.</p><p>You can enroll yourself <a id="id125" class="indexterm"/>in the iOS Developer Program for iOS <a id="id126" class="indexterm"/>at <a class="ulink" href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/">http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/</a>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00242.jpeg" alt="Becoming an iOS developer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>While signing up to be an iOS developer, there are a number of possibilities when it comes to your current status. If you already have an Apple ID, which you use with your iTunes or Apple online store purchases, you could choose the <span class="strong"><strong>I already have an Apple ID…</strong></span> option. In order to illustrate all the steps to sign up, we will start as a brand new user, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00243.jpeg" alt="Becoming an iOS developer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>You can choose whether you want to sign up as an individual or as a company.

The one shown in the following screenshot is the general <span class="strong"><strong>Registered Apple Developer Agreement</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00246.jpeg" alt="Becoming an iOS developer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>In order to verify the e-mail address you have used, a verification code is sent to you with a link in the e-mail, <a id="id129" class="indexterm"/>you can click this, or enter the code manually. Once you have completed the verification code step, you can then enter your billing details.</p><p>It could be that you might go on to make LiveCode applications for the Mac App Store, in which case, you will need to add the <span class="strong"><strong>Mac Developer Program</strong></span> product. For our purpose, we only need to sign up for the iOS Developer Program, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00247.jpeg" alt="Becoming an iOS developer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>Each product that you sign <a id="id130" class="indexterm"/>up for has its own agreement. Lots of small print to read!</p><p>The actual purchasing of the iOS developer account is handled through the Apple Store of your own region, shown as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00248.jpeg" alt="Becoming an iOS developer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>As you can see in the next <a id="id131" class="indexterm"/>screenshot, it is going to cost you $99 per year or $198 per year if you also sign up for the Mac Developer account. Most LiveCode users won't need to sign up for the Mac Developer account unless their plan is to submit desktop apps to the Mac App Store.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00249.jpeg" alt="Becoming an iOS developer"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>After submitting the order, you <a id="id132" class="indexterm"/>are rewarded with a message that tells you that you are now registered as an Apple developer!</p><p>Sadly, you won't get an instant approval, as was the case with Android Market or Amazon Appstore.

<span class="strong"><strong>Coping with newer and older devices</strong></span>
</p><p>In early 2012, Apple brought to the market a new version of iPad. The main selling point of <a id="id138" class="indexterm"/>this one compared to iPad 2 is that it has a Retina display. The original iPads have a resolution of 1024 x 768 and the Retina version has a resolution of 2048 x 1536. If you wish to build applications to take advantage of this, you must get the current version of Xcode from Mac App Store and not one of the older versions from the developer page. The new version of Xcode demands that you work on Mac OS 10.10 or its later versions. So, to fully support the latest devices, you may have to update your system software more than you were expecting! But wait, there's more… By taking a later version of Xcode, you are missing the iOS SDK versions needed to support older iOS devices, such as the original iPhone and iPhone 3G. Fortunately, you can go to Preferences in Xcode where there is a Downloads tab where you can get these older SDKs downloaded in the new version of Xcode. Typically, Apple only allows you to download one version older than the one that is currently provided in Xcode. There <a id="id139" class="indexterm"/>are <a id="id140" class="indexterm"/>older versions available, but are not accepted by Apple for App Store submission.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Pointing LiveCode to the iOS SDKs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec39"/>Pointing LiveCode to the iOS SDKs</h2></div></div></div><p>Open the <a id="id141" class="indexterm"/>LiveCode <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> and choose <span class="strong"><strong>Mobile </strong></span>

For example, on an Android 3 (Honeycomb) device, you need to go to the <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Development</strong></span> menu and you need to activate the <span class="strong"><strong>USB debugging</strong></span> mode.

</h2></div></div></div><p>In addition to getting a test stack to work on real devices, we also saw how easy it is, once it's all configured, to test a stack, straight on an Android device. If you are developing an app that is to be deployed on both Android and iOS, you may find that the fastest way to work is to test with the iOS Simulator for iOS tests, but for this, you need to test directly on an Android device instead of using the Android SDK virtual devices.</p></div><div class="section" title="Have a go hero – Nook"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec49"/>Have a go hero – Nook</h2></div></div></div><p>Until recently, the Android support for the Nook Color from Barnes &amp; Noble wasn't good enough to install LiveCode <a id="id174" class="indexterm"/>apps.

Fortunately, you only have to go through it once.</p><p>In this chapter, we worked through a number of tasks that you have to do before you create a mobile app in LiveCode. We had to sign up as an iOS developer before we could download and install Xcode and iOS SDKs. We then downloaded and installed the Android SDK and configured LiveCode for devices and simulators.</p><p>We also covered some topics that will be useful once you are ready to upload a finished app. We showed you how to sign up for the Android Market and Amazon Appstore.</p><p>There will be a few more mundane things that we have to cover at the end of the book, but not for a while! Next up, we will start to play with some of the special abilities of mobile devices.</p></div></body></html>
