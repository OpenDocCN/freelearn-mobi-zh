			<p>Welcome to iOS 15 Programming for Beginners. This book is the sixth edition of the iOS Programming for Beginners series, and has been fully updated for iOS 15, macOS 12.0 Monterey, and Xcode 13.</p>
			<p>In this book, you will build a restaurant reservation app called <em class="italic">Let's Eat</em>. You will start off by exploring Xcode, Apple's programming environment, also known as its <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>). Next, you will start learning the foundations of Swift, the programming language used in iOS apps, and see how it is used to accomplish common programming tasks.</p>
			<p>Once you have a solid foundation of using Swift, you will start creating the user interface of the <em class="italic">Let's Eat</em> app. During this process, you will work with storyboards and connect your app's scenes together using segues.</p>
			<p>With your user interface complete, you will then add code to implement your app's functionality. To display your data in a grid, you will use collection views, and to display your data in a list, you will use table views. You will also look at how to add basic and custom annotations on to a map. You'll see how you can use JSON files to get actual restaurant data into your collection views, table views, and map. You'll enable users to add ratings, reviews and photos for a particular restaurant, which you'll save using Core Data.</p>
			<p>You now have a complete app, but how about adding the latest iOS 15 features? You'll start by modifying your app to work on both iPhone and iPad, and make it work on Macs. Next, you will learn how to develop apps using SwiftUI, a great new way of developing apps for all Apple platforms. After that, you'll implement asynchronous and parallel programming using Swift Concurrency, and implement shared user experiences for your app using SharePlay.</p>
			<p>Finally, you'll learn how to test your app with internal and external testers, and get it into the App Store.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>This book has been completely revised for iOS 15, macOS 12.0 Monterey, Xcode 13, and Swift 5.5. <em class="italic">Part 4</em> of this book also covers the latest technologies introduced by Apple during WWDC 2021, which are Mac Catalyst, SwiftUI, Swift Concurrency, and SharePlay.</p>
			<p>To complete all the exercises in this book, you will need:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Mac computer running macOS 11 Big Sur or macOS 12.0 Monterey</li>
				<li>Xcode 13.0 or later</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To check if your Mac supports macOS 12.0 Big Sur, see this link: <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/">https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/</a>. If your Mac is supported, you can update macOS using Software Update in System Preferences.</p>
			<p>To get the latest version of Xcode, you can download it from the Mac App Store. Most of the exercises can be completed without an Apple Developer account and use the iOS Simulator. If you wish to test the app you are developing on an actual iOS device, you will need a free or paid Apple Developer account, and the following chapters require a paid Apple Developer account:</p>
