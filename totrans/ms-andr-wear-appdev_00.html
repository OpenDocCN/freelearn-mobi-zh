Furthermore, you may already have apps featured on the Google Play store and are looking to provide Android Wear support for your existing Android apps. If either of these statements is true, then yes, this book is for you.</p><p>Our primary goal in this book is to provide you, the reader, with a solid understanding of the philosophy, thought process, development details, and methodologies involved in building well-designed and robust Android Wear applications. We'll cover the advantages and the disadvantages of the wearable computing paradigm, and in doing so, we hope to provide a strong foundation for building wearable apps to meet practical and real-world use cases.</p><p>We will explore a wide range of concepts and features, from basic to medium to advanced, with varying degrees of complexity. Code samples accompanying each chapter are intended to give you hands-on knowledge of using the tools, libraries, SDKs, and other relevant technology needed to build Android Wear apps.</p><p>As you journey through the chapters of this book, you can expect to achieve the following objectives:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Understand wearable computing technology</li><li class="listitem">Set up your development environment for building Android Wear apps using Android Studio</li><li class="listitem">Begin a mastery of the Android Wear SDK and APIs</li><li class="listitem">Understand the commonly used UI patterns and UX principles surrounding Android Wear app development</li><li class="listitem">Work with different form factors of wearable devices (round, square)</li><li class="listitem">Take advantage of the sensors available on Android Wear devices</li><li class="listitem">Develop Android Wear sample apps to try out the concepts you learn</li><li class="listitem">Communicate between Android mobile (handheld) and Android Wear apps</li><li class="listitem">Learn how to publish Android Wear apps to the Google Play store</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 1.  Introduction to Wearable Computing" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S1">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to Wearable Computing</em></span>, covers the basics of wearable computing in general and how the technology has evolved. It also includes discussions on mobile computing, ubiquitous computing, and cloud computing.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 2.  Setting up the Development Environment" href="part0020.xhtml#aid-J2B81">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Setting up the Development Environment</em></span>, shifts the focus on getting the readers familiar with setting up a development environment, from IDE installation to a discussion of the SDKs and libraries needed for Android Wear development.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Developing Android Wear Applications" href="part0028.xhtml#aid-QMFO1">Chapter 3</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Developing an Android Wear App</em></span>, walks the reader through step-by-step instructions for developing an Android Wear application, the Today app, from scratch using Android Studio.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 4.  Developing Watch UI" href="part0034.xhtml#aid-10DJ41">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Developing Watch UIs</em></span>, extends the Today app using UI components available in the Android Wear SDK and builds custom UI components using custom layouts.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 5. Synchronizing Data" href="part0041.xhtml#aid-173721">Chapter 5</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Synchronizing Data</em></span>, introduces the idea of the need for a companion handheld app, including the steps to pair a handheld with an Android Wear emulator, thereby expanding your environment for wearable app development. The Today app is further extended to demonstrate these concepts.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 6.  Contextual Notifications" href="part0046.xhtml#aid-1BRPS1">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Contextual Notifications</em></span>, discusses notifications in Android Wear and extends the Today app with an On This Day activity to demonstrate the Android Wear Notifications API.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 7.  Voice Interactions, Sensors, and Tracking" href="part0051.xhtml#aid-1GKCM1">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Voice Interactions, Sensors, and Tracking</em></span>, discusses the voice capabilities offered by the Wear API. We define a voice action to launch our app. We introduce device sensors and discuss how they can be used to track data.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 8. Creating Custom UI" href="part0059.xhtml#aid-1O8H61">Chapter 8</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Creating a Custom UI</em></span>, covers the design principles that are central to the Android Wear UI space and examines a few common Wear UI patterns. We also augment the On This Day activity to display in a user-friendly format.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 9.  Material Design" href="part0063.xhtml#aid-1S2JE2">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Material Design</em></span>, provides a conceptual understanding of material design and touches upon a few key principles specific to wearable app design and development. We solidify our understanding by extending our Todo app from the previous chapters to incorporate a navigation drawer that lets us switch between to-do categories, view items, and perform actions specific to each category.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 10.  Watch Faces" href="part0074.xhtml#aid-26I9K2">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Watch Faces</em></span>, introduces the concept of watch faces in this chapter. After a brief survey of the Android Wear APIs available to help us develop watch faces, we develop a simple interactive watch face.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 11.  Advanced Features and Concepts" href="part0083.xhtml#aid-2F4UM1">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Features and Concepts</em></span>, describes the design concerns and API features related to making apps run as if they were always on. We develop an activity to demonstrate the always-on capability provided by the Wear API. We also touch upon debugging wear apps over Bluetooth connections.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 12. Publishing Apps to Google Play" href="part0088.xhtml#aid-2JTHG2">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Publishing Apps to Google Play</em></span>, discusses the tooling available to test Android Wear apps and how to automate UI testing.
