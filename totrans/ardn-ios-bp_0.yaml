- en: It was the fall of 2011, and I was working on some iOS apps. On my desk lay
    an Arduino board that was almost unused. A thought came to me—it would be great
    to integrate the iOS platform and Arduino. I could control almost everything from
    anywhere, from my home to industrial machines.

- en: I started working on this and I eventually designed Arduino Manager. It is a
    general-purpose iOS application based on widgets, which acquires data from Arduino
    and depicts it with gauges, graphs, and other means. Arduino Manager allows you
    to control an Arduino board through switches, knobs, sliders, and other means
    (more information on this is available at [http://apple.co/1NPfL6i](http://apple.co/1NPfL6i)).

    to make the Arduino and iOS devices work together.

- en: I will show you how to build five amazing projects, and you will learn how the
    additional electronics around Arduino work. You will also learn how to use digital
    and analog sensors, program the Arduino board, and develop iOS applications that
    can transfer data with Arduino. Projects are described in detail, providing you
    with a learning tool and not just some sketches or some iOS code to copy.

- en: '[Chapter 1](part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S2 "Chapter 1. Arduino and iOS – Platforms
    and Integration"), *Arduino and iOS – Platforms and Integration*, will give you
    a brief introduction to the two platforms and introduce the integration methods
    between them. Moreover, you will learn how to set up the development environments
    on both the platforms and get ready for the projects in the subsequent chapters.'

    *Bluetooth Pet Door Locker*, develops a project that helps you automatically lock
    the pet door at night by measuring the external light, monitoring whether it is
    locked or unlocked, and manually operating it as needed. This is done by using
    an iOS device.'

    Power Plug*, is about learning how to make a smart power plug that is controlled
    thorough Wi-Fi. This is not based on the traditional relay technique, and the
    iOS application is full of useful features.'

    *Automatic Garage Door Opener*, covers a project that will allow you to automatically
    open your garage door by just getting close enough to it, without even touching
    the iOS device. The project takes advantage of the iBeacon technology.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To build the hardware side of the projects, you will need an Arduino board and
    some other electronic components.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To develop the Arduino firmware, you just need the Arduino IDE, which can be
    downloaded for free from the Arduino site.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To develop the iOS applications, you need the Xcode development environment
    (available for free from Apple). Since the Xcode is available only for the MAC
    platform, you need an Intel-based MAC computer. Most of the projects are based
    on Bluetooth 4 protocol. Hence, you need an iOS device that supports this protocol.
