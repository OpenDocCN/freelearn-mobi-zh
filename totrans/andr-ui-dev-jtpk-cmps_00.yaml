- en: Jetpack Compose is Android's new framework for building fast, beautiful, and
    reliable native user interfaces. It simplifies and significantly accelerates UI
    development on Android using the declarative approach. This book will help developers
    to get hands-on with Jetpack Compose and adopt a modern way of building Android
    applications. The book is not an introduction to Android development, but it will
    build on your knowledge of how Android apps are developed.

- en: Complete with hands-on tutorials and projects, this easy-to-follow guide will
    get you up to speed with the fundamentals of Jetpack Compose, such as state hoisting,
    unidirectional data flow, and composition over inheritance, and help you build
    your own Android apps using Compose. You'll also cover concepts such as testing,
    animation, and interoperability with the existing Android UI toolkit.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for any mobile app developer looking to understand the fundamentals
    of the new Jetpack Compose framework and the benefits of native development. A
    solid understanding of Android app development, along with some knowledge of the
    Kotlin programming language, will be beneficial. Basic programming knowledge is
    necessary to grasp the concepts covered in this book effectively.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17505_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *Building Your First
    Compose App*, shows you how to build your first Compose app. Also, important key
    ideas such as composable functions and using previews are introduced. It is important
    to whet the appetite with early success, so we''ll build, preview, and run composable
    functions before digging too deep into details.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B17505_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040), *Understanding the Declarative
    Paradigm*, explains how this was done before, and what the issues with the *old*
    approach are. Also, you''ll an idea how composables are different to Views, and
    why this is both important and beneficial.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B17505_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054), *Exploring the Key Principles
    of Compose*, introduces the key principles that Jetpack Compose relies on. This
    knowledge is essential for writing well-behaved Compose apps.'

- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B17505_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor076), *Laying Out UI Elements*,
    introduces you to some of the existing layouts. It also shows you how to implement
    custom layouts. These are needed if the built-in layouts cannot provide the required
    distribution of UI elements onscreen.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B17505_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor089), *Managing the State of
    Your Composable Functions*, takes a look at how Jetpack Compose uses state. State
    is app data that may change over time. Composable functions display and modify
    state. Jetpack Compose is based upon a small set of principles regarding how to
    use state. This chapter acquaints you with these principles.'

- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B17505_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105), *Putting Pieces Together*,
    catches up on previously learned concepts and brings them together in one app.
    Seeing concepts in real code helps understand them and makes it easier to reuse
    them in your own programs.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B17505_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor119), *Tips, Tricks, and Best
    Practices*, provides best practices when using Compose. These will include topics
    such as persisting and retrieving state and using so-called side effects. The
    chapter also shows things to avoid, such as having heavy computations inside a
    composable function.'

- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B17505_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor135), *Working with Animations*,
    introduces all relevant APIs. Animations and transitions make apps really shine.
    Jetpack Compose simplifies the process of adding animation effects greatly over
    the old View-based approach.'

- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B17505_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor148), *Exploring Interoperability
    APIs*, discusses strategies to combine declarative and imperative approaches in
    one app and offers a migration strategy to painlessly update existing UIs to Jetpack
    Compose.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 10*](B17505_10_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor159), *Testing and Debugging
    Compose Apps*, introduces basic testing scenarios for Compose apps. Testing the
    user interface of a Compose app works differently than testing a view-based UI.
    Compose uses a more declarative approach to testing.'

    Steps*, wraps up the book in directing you to things you can try next. Also, the
    chapter attempts to guess what the future will hold for Jetpack Compose and looks
    into neighboring platforms and how you can benefit from your knowledge on them.'
