    of Test Driven Development and Acceptance Testing. Both techniques were discussed
    in previous chapters, so you may want to look back at [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting
    Started with Testing"), *Getting Started with Testing* and [Chapter 4](ch04.html

    a common vocabulary to describe the tests and the inclusion of business participants
    in the software development project. And some people still believe that it is
    only Test Driven Development done right.
  prefs: []

- en: We have visited Test Driven Development before and we focused on converting
    low level requirements into tests that could drive our development process. Behavior
    Driven Development forces us to concentrate on higher level requirements and on
    using a specific vocabulary we can express these requirements in a way that can
    be further analyzed or evaluated.

- en: Behavior Driven Development was a term introduced by Dan North back in 2003
    to describe a technique that focuses on collaboration between developers and other
    stakeholders by using a process usually called **outside-in** software development.
    Its primary goal is to satisfy the business needs of the client.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Behavior Driven Development grew out of a thought experiment based on **Neuro
    Linguistic Programming** (**NLP**) techniques.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary idea is that the words used to describe a thought severely influence
    that thought to the point that we seem to think in the language we speak.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is empirical proof of the fact that subjects in memory tests are more
    likely to remember a specific color if their mother language has a specific word
    for that color. So if we have a specific language to describe our requirements,
    it would probably influence the way we think about them and hence improve the
    way we write them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, the words used by Behavior Driven Development were carefully selected
    to influence the way you think about the specification of features. They are closely
    related to the notion of cause-effect and follow this concept to describe a feature
    starting from a known state, applying some process, and expecting some results.

    we are still limited to test subjects that are testable under the JVM avoiding
    the use of Android-specific classes and mainly the User Interface. We will be
    exploring some alternatives to overcome this limitation in [Chapter 10](ch10.html
    "Chapter 10. Alternative Testing Tactics"), *Alternative Testing Tactics.*
