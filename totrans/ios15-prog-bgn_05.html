			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Chapter 4</em>: Range Operators and Loops</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, you looked at conditionals, which allow you to do different things based on different conditions, and optionals, which enable you to create variables that may or may not have a value.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn about <strong class="bold">range operators</strong> and <strong class="bold">loops</strong>. Range operators allow you to represent a range of values by specifying the start and end values for a range, and you'll learn about the different types of range operators. Loops allow you to repeat an instruction or a sequence of instructions over and over. You can repeat a sequence a fixed number of times, or repeat a sequence until a condition is met. You'll learn about the different types of loops used to accomplish this.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you'll have learned how to use ranges, and how to create and use the different types of loops (<strong class="source-inline">for-in</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">while</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">repeat-while</strong>).</p>
			<p>The following topics will be covered: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exploring Range operators</li>
				<li>Exploring Loops</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If you wish to start from scratch, create a new playground and name it <strong class="source-inline">RangeOperatorsAndLoops</strong>.</p>
			<p>You can type in and run all the code in this chapter as you go along. Let's start with specifying a range of numbers using range operators.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Exploring Range operators</h1>
			<p>Range<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> operators allow you to represent a range of values. Let's say you want to represent a sequence of numbers starting with <strong class="source-inline">firstNumber</strong> and ending with <strong class="source-inline">lastNumber</strong>. You don't need to specify every value; you can just specify the range in this way:</p>
			<p class="source-code">firstNumber...lastNumber</p>
			<p>Imagine you need to write a program for a department store which automatically sends a discount voucher to customers between the ages of 18 and 30. It would be very cumbersome if you needed to set up an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement for each age. It's much more convenient to use a range operator in this case.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">For more information on range operators, visit: <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html">https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html</a>.</p>
			<p>Let's try this out in the playground. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Add the following code to your playground and click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:<p class="source-code">let myRange = 10...20</p><p>This will assign a number sequence that starts with <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> and ends with <strong class="source-inline">20</strong>, including both numbers, to the <strong class="source-inline">myRange</strong> constant. This is known as a <strong class="bold">closed range operator</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>The result displayed in the Results area may be truncated. Click the square icon to the right of the result. It will be displayed inline in the Editor area:<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Figure_4.1_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1: Editor area displaying inline result&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1: Editor area displaying inline result</p><p>You can now see the complete result in a box under the line of code. You can drag the <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>right edge to make the box bigger if you wish.</p><p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">Remember you can drag the border between the Results and Editor areas to increase the size of the Results area.</p></li>
				<li>If you don't want to include the last number of the sequence in the range, use <strong class="source-inline">..&lt;</strong> in place of <strong class="source-inline">...</strong>. Type in and run the following code:<p class="source-code">let myRange2 = 10..&lt;20</p><p>This will store the sequence starting with <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> and ending with <strong class="source-inline">19</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">myRange2</strong> constant and is known as a <strong class="bold">half-open range operator</strong>.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is one more type of range operator, the <strong class="bold">one-sided range operator</strong>, and you will learn about that in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>Now that you know how to create and use ranges, you will learn about loops, the different loop types, and how to use them in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Exploring Loops</h1>
			<p>In programming, you <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>frequently need to do the same thing over and over again. For example, each month, a company will need to generate payroll slips for each employee. If the company has 10,000 employees, it would be inefficient to write 10,000 instructions to create the payroll slips. Repeating a single instruction 10,000 times would be better, and loops are used for this.</p>
			<p>There are three types of loop; the <strong class="source-inline">for-in</strong> loop, the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop, and the <strong class="source-inline">repeat-while</strong> loop. The <strong class="source-inline">for-in</strong> loop will repeat for a known number of times, and the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">repeat-while</strong> loops will repeat as long as the loop condition is true.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">For more information on loops, visit: <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ControlFlow.html">https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ControlFlow.html</a>.</p>
			<p>Let's look at each type in turn, starting with the <strong class="source-inline">for-in</strong> loop, which is used when you know how many times a loop should be repeated.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Using the for-in loop</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">for-in</strong> loop <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>steps<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> through every value in a sequence, and a set of statements in curly braces, known as the loop body, are executed each time. Each value is assigned to a temporary variable in turn, and the temporary variable can be used within the loop body. Here is what it looks like:</p>
			<p class="source-code">for item in sequence {   </p>
			<p class="source-code">   code</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>The number of times the loop repeats is dictated by the number of items in the sequence. Let's begin by creating a <strong class="source-inline">for-in</strong> loop to display all the numbers in <strong class="source-inline">myRange</strong>. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Add the following code to your playground and click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:<p class="source-code">for number in myRange {</p><p class="source-code">   print(number)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>You should see each number in the sequence displayed in the Debug area. Note that the statements inside the loop are executed 11 times since <strong class="source-inline">myRange</strong> includes the last number in the range. </p></li>
				<li>Let's try the same program, but this time with <strong class="source-inline">myRange2</strong>. Modify the code as follows and run it:<p class="source-code">for number in <strong class="bold">myRange2</strong> {</p><p class="source-code">   print(number)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>The statements <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>inside the<a id="_idIndexMarker140"/> loop are executed 10 times, and the last value printed in the Debug area is <strong class="source-inline">19</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>You can even use a range operator directly after the <strong class="source-inline">in</strong> keyword. Type and run the following code:<p class="source-code">for number in 0...5 {</p><p class="source-code">   print(number)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>Each number from <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">5</strong> is displayed in the Debug area.</p></li>
				<li>If you want the sequence to be reversed, use the <strong class="source-inline">reversed()</strong> function. Modify the code as follows and run it:<p class="source-code">for number in <strong class="bold">(</strong>0...5<strong class="bold">).reversed()</strong> {</p><p class="source-code">   print(number)</p><p class="source-code">}</p><p>Each number from <strong class="source-inline">5</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> is displayed in the Debug area.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Great job! Let's check out <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loops in the next section, which are used when a loop sequence <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>should <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>be repeated as long as a condition is <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Using the while loop</h2>
			<p>A <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>contains a<a id="_idIndexMarker144"/> condition and a set of statements in curly braces, known as the loop body. The condition is checked first; if <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, the loop body is executed, and the loop repeats until the condition is <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>. Here is what it looks like:</p>
			<p class="source-code">while condition == true {</p>
			<p class="source-code">   code</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>Add the following code to create a variable, increment it by <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>, and keep on doing it as long as the variable's value is less than <strong class="source-inline">50</strong>. Click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var y = 0</p>
			<p class="source-code">while y &lt; 50 {</p>
			<p class="source-code">   y += 5</p>
			<p class="source-code">   print("y is \(y)")</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>Let's step through the code. Initially, <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> is set to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">y &lt; 50</strong> condition is checked and returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, so the loop body is executed. The value of <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> is incremented by <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">y is 5</strong> is printed in the Debug area. The loop repeats, and <strong class="source-inline">y &lt; 50</strong> is checked again. Since <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> is now <strong class="source-inline">5</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">5 &lt; 50</strong> still returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, the loop body is executed again. This is repeated until the value of <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">50</strong>, at which point <strong class="source-inline">y &lt; 50</strong> returns <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> and the loop stops.</p>
			<p>If the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop's condition is <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> to begin with, the loop body will never be executed. Try changing the value of <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">100</strong> to see this.</p>
			<p>In the next section, you'll study <strong class="source-inline">repeat-while</strong> loops. These will execute the statements in the loop body first before checking the loop condition.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>The repeat-while loop</h2>
			<p>Like a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop, a <strong class="source-inline">repeat-while</strong> loop <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>also contains a condition <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>and a loop body, but the loop body is executed first before the condition is checked. If the condition is <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, the loop repeats until the condition returns <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>. Here is what it looks like:</p>
			<p class="source-code">repeat {</p>
			<p class="source-code">   code</p>
			<p class="source-code">} while condition == true</p>
			<p>Add the following code to create a variable, increment it by <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>, and keep on doing it as long as the variable's value is less than <strong class="source-inline">50</strong>. Click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var x = 0</p>
			<p class="source-code">repeat {</p>
			<p class="source-code">   x += 5</p>
			<p class="source-code">   print("x is \(x)")</p>
			<p class="source-code">} while x &lt; 50</p>
			<p>Let's step through the code. Initially, <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is set to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. The loop body is executed. The value of <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is incremented by <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>, so now <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> contains <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">x is 5</strong> is printed to the Debug area. The <strong class="source-inline">x &lt; 50</strong> condition is checked, and since it returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, the loop is repeated. The value of <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is incremented by <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>, so now <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> contains <strong class="source-inline">10</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">x is 10</strong> is printed to the Debug area. The loop is repeated until <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> contains <strong class="source-inline">50</strong>, at which point <strong class="source-inline">x &lt; 50</strong> returns <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> and the loop stops.</p>
			<p>The loop body will be<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> executed at least once, even if the condition is <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> to begin with. Try<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> changing the value of <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">100</strong> to see this.</p>
			<p>You now know how to create and use different loop types. Awesome!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you looked at closed and half-open range operators, which allow you to specify a range of numbers rather than specifying every individual number discretely. </p>
			<p>You also learned about the three different loop types, the <strong class="source-inline">for-in</strong> loop, the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop, and the <strong class="source-inline">repeat-while</strong> loop. The <strong class="source-inline">for-in</strong> loop allows you to repeat a set of statements a fixed number of times, and the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">repeat-while</strong> loops allow you to repeat a set of statements as long as a condition is true. Great job!</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will study collection types, which allow you to store a collection of data referenced by an index, a collection of key-value pairs, and an unstructured collection of data.</p>
