			<p>In the previous chapter, you looked at conditionals, which allow you to do different things based on different conditions, and optionals, which enable you to create variables that may or may not have a value.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn about <strong class="bold">range operators</strong> and <strong class="bold">loops</strong>. Range operators allow you to represent a range of values by specifying the start and end values for a range, and you'll learn about the different types of range operators. Loops allow you to repeat an instruction or a sequence of instructions over and over. You can repeat a sequence a fixed number of times, or repeat a sequence until a condition is met. You'll learn about the different types of loops used to accomplish this.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you'll have learned how to use ranges, and how to create and use the different types of loops (<code>for-in</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>repeat-while</code>).</p>
			<p>The following topics will be covered: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exploring Range operators</li>
				<li>Exploring Loops</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If you wish to start from scratch, create a new playground and name it <code>RangeOperatorsAndLoops</code>.</p>
			<p>You can type in and run all the code in this chapter as you go along. Let's start with specifying a range of numbers using range operators.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Exploring Range operators</h1>
			<p>Range<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> operators allow you to represent a range of values. Let's say you want to represent a sequence of numbers starting with <code>firstNumber</code> and ending with <code>lastNumber</code>. You don't need to specify every value; you can just specify the range in this way:</p>
			<pre>firstNumber...lastNumber</pre>
			<p>Imagine you need to write a program for a department store which automatically sends a discount voucher to customers between the ages of 18 and 30. It would be very cumbersome if you needed to set up an <code>if</code> or <code>switch</code> statement for each age. It's much more convenient to use a range operator in this case.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">For more information on range operators, visit: <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html">https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html</a>.</p>
			<p>Let's try this out in the playground. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Add the following code to your playground and click the <code>10</code> and ends with <code>20</code>, including both numbers, to the <code>myRange</code> constant. This is known as a <strong class="bold">closed range operator</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>The result displayed in the Results area may be truncated. Click the square icon to the right of the result. It will be displayed inline in the Editor area:<div><img src="img/Figure_4.1_B17469.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1: Editor area displaying inline result&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1: Editor area displaying inline result</p><p>You can now see the complete result in a box under the line of code. You can drag the <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>right edge to make the box bigger if you wish.</p><p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">Remember you can drag the border between the Results and Editor areas to increase the size of the Results area.</p></li>
				<li>If you don't want to include the last number of the sequence in the range, use <code>..&lt;</code> in place of <code>...</code>. Type in and run the following code:<pre>let myRange2 = 10..&lt;20</pre><p>This will store the sequence starting with <code>10</code> and ending with <code>19</code> in the <code>myRange2</code> constant and is known as a <strong class="bold">half-open range operator</strong>.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There is one more type of range operator, the <strong class="bold">one-sided range operator</strong>, and you will learn about that in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>Now that you know how to create and use ranges, you will learn about loops, the different loop types, and how to use them in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Exploring Loops</h1>
			<p>In programming, you <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>frequently need to do the same thing over and over again. For example, each month, a company will need to generate payroll slips for each employee. If the company has 10,000 employees, it would be inefficient to write 10,000 instructions to create the payroll slips. Repeating a single instruction 10,000 times would be better, and loops are used for this.</p>
			<p>There are three types of loop; the <code>for-in</code> loop, the <code>while</code> loop, and the <code>repeat-while</code> loop. The <code>for-in</code> loop will repeat for a known number of times, and the <code>while</code> and <code>repeat-while</code> loops will repeat as long as the loop condition is true.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Information</p>
			<p class="callout">For more information on loops, visit: <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ControlFlow.html">https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ControlFlow.html</a>.</p>
			<p>Let's look at each type in turn, starting with the <code>for-in</code> loop, which is used when you know how many times a loop should be repeated.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Using the for-in loop</h2>
			<p>The <code>for-in</code> loop <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>steps<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> through every value in a sequence, and a set of statements in curly braces, known as the loop body, are executed each time. Each value is assigned to a temporary variable in turn, and the temporary variable can be used within the loop body. Here is what it looks like:</p>
			<pre>for item in sequence {   
   code
}</pre>
			<p>The number of times the loop repeats is dictated by the number of items in the sequence. Let's begin by creating a <code>for-in</code> loop to display all the numbers in <code>myRange</code>. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Add the following code to your playground and click the <code>myRange</code> includes the last number in the range. </p></li>
				<li>Let's try the same program, but this time with <code>myRange2</code>. Modify the code as follows and run it:<pre>for number in <code>19</code>.</p></li>
				<li>You can even use a range operator directly after the <code>in</code> keyword. Type and run the following code:<pre>for number in 0...5 {
   print(number)
}</pre><p>Each number from <code>0</code> to <code>5</code> is displayed in the Debug area.</p></li>
				<li>If you want the sequence to be reversed, use the <code>reversed()</code> function. Modify the code as follows and run it:<pre>for number in <code>5</code> to <code>0</code> is displayed in the Debug area.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Great job! Let's check out <code>while</code> loops in the next section, which are used when a loop sequence <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>should <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>be repeated as long as a condition is <code>true</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Using the while loop</h2>
			<p>A <code>while</code> loop <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>contains a<a id="_idIndexMarker144"/> condition and a set of statements in curly braces, known as the loop body. The condition is checked first; if <code>true</code>, the loop body is executed, and the loop repeats until the condition is <code>false</code>. Here is what it looks like:</p>
			<pre>while condition == true {
   code
}</pre>
			<p>Add the following code to create a variable, increment it by <code>5</code>, and keep on doing it as long as the variable's value is less than <code>50</code>. Click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<pre>var y = 0
while y &lt; 50 {
   y += 5
   print("y is \(y)")
}</pre>
			<p>Let's step through the code. Initially, <code>y</code> is set to <code>0</code>. The <code>y &lt; 50</code> condition is checked and returns <code>true</code>, so the loop body is executed. The value of <code>y</code> is incremented by <code>5</code>, and <code>y is 5</code> is printed in the Debug area. The loop repeats, and <code>y &lt; 50</code> is checked again. Since <code>y</code> is now <code>5</code> and <code>5 &lt; 50</code> still returns <code>true</code>, the loop body is executed again. This is repeated until the value of <code>y</code> is <code>50</code>, at which point <code>y &lt; 50</code> returns <code>false</code> and the loop stops.</p>
			<p>If the <code>while</code> loop's condition is <code>false</code> to begin with, the loop body will never be executed. Try changing the value of <code>y</code> to <code>100</code> to see this.</p>
			<p>In the next section, you'll study <code>repeat-while</code> loops. These will execute the statements in the loop body first before checking the loop condition.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>The repeat-while loop</h2>
			<p>Like a <code>while</code> loop, a <code>repeat-while</code> loop <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>also contains a condition <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>and a loop body, but the loop body is executed first before the condition is checked. If the condition is <code>true</code>, the loop repeats until the condition returns <code>false</code>. Here is what it looks like:</p>
			<pre>repeat {
   code
} while condition == true</pre>
			<p>Add the following code to create a variable, increment it by <code>5</code>, and keep on doing it as long as the variable's value is less than <code>50</code>. Click the <strong class="bold">Play/Stop</strong> button to run it:</p>
			<pre>var x = 0
repeat {
   x += 5
   print("x is \(x)")
} while x &lt; 50</pre>
			<p>Let's step through the code. Initially, <code>x</code> is set to <code>0</code>. The loop body is executed. The value of <code>x</code> is incremented by <code>5</code>, so now <code>x</code> contains <code>5</code>, and <code>x is 5</code> is printed to the Debug area. The <code>x &lt; 50</code> condition is checked, and since it returns <code>true</code>, the loop is repeated. The value of <code>x</code> is incremented by <code>5</code>, so now <code>x</code> contains <code>10</code>, and <code>x is 10</code> is printed to the Debug area. The loop is repeated until <code>x</code> contains <code>50</code>, at which point <code>x &lt; 50</code> returns <code>false</code> and the loop stops.</p>
			<p>The loop body will be<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> executed at least once, even if the condition is <code>false</code> to begin with. Try<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> changing the value of <code>x</code> to <code>100</code> to see this.</p>
			<p>You now know how to create and use different loop types. Awesome!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you looked at closed and half-open range operators, which allow you to specify a range of numbers rather than specifying every individual number discretely. </p>
			<p>You also learned about the three different loop types, the <code>for-in</code> loop, the <code>while</code> loop, and the <code>repeat-while</code> loop. The <code>for-in</code> loop allows you to repeat a set of statements a fixed number of times, and the <code>while</code> and <code>repeat-while</code> loops allow you to repeat a set of statements as long as a condition is true. Great job!</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, you will study collection types, which allow you to store a collection of data referenced by an index, a collection of key-value pairs, and an unstructured collection of data.</p>
