- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Building Blocks – Variables, Collections,
    and Flow Control"), *Building Blocks - Variables, Collections, and Flow Control*,
    introduces you to the various built-in mechanisms Swift has for representing complex
    information in expressive and accessible ways, with the help of a real-world example.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. One Piece at a Time – Types, Scopes, and
    Projects"), *One Piece at a Time - Types, Scopes, and Projects*, introduces the
    tools necessary to closely model the real world with code. It will teach you how
    to define your own custom types using structures, classes, and enumerations. It
    also explores the concept of scope and access control.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. To Be or Not To Be – Optionals"), *To Be
    or Not To Be - Optionals*, focuses on a special and critical type in Swift, called

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. A Modern Paradigm – Closures and Functional
    Programming"), *A Modern Paradigm - Closures and Functional Programming*, introduces
    you to a new way of thinking about code called functional programming. We learn
    how Swift supports this technique and how we can apply it to our programs to make
    it even more understandable and expressive.'
