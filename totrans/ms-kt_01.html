			<p>Kotlin is a static programming language that allows you to write concise and typed code. It’s the language preferred for Android development <span class="No-Break">by Google.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’ll get to know Kotlin as a programming language. We will cover features that are useful for Android development and their importance for Android developers. Additionally, we’ll cover how to migrate from Java to Kotlin and some useful tips for developers coming from <span class="No-Break">Java backgrounds.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction <span class="No-Break">to Kotlin</span></li>
				<li>Kotlin syntax, types, functions, <span class="No-Break">and classes</span></li>
				<li>Migrating from Java <span class="No-Break">to Kotlin</span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow the instructions in this chapter, you’ll need to have the <span class="No-Break">following ready:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>IntelliJ IDEA Community <span class="No-Break">Edition (</span><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/</span></a><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li>OpenJDK 11 or <span class="No-Break">higher (</span><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/"><span class="No-Break">https://openjdk.java.net/install/</span></a><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Introduction to Kotlin</h1>
			<p>Kotlin is a language that runs on the <strong class="bold">Java Virtual Machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">JVM</strong>) developed by JetBrains. It was<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> developed to <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>overcome the following challenges that <span class="No-Break">Java had:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Verbosity</strong>: Java has a very verbose <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>syntax and this leads to developers writing a lot of boilerplate code even for <span class="No-Break">trivial tasks.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Null pointer exceptions</strong>: By default, Java allows variables to have null values. This normally results in null pointer exceptions, which has been called <strong class="bold">the billion-dollar</strong> <strong class="bold">mistake</strong> in Java <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>as many applications have been affected <span class="No-Break">by this.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Concurency</strong>: Java has threads, but managing concurrency and thread safety can be such a hard task at times. This leads to a lot of performance and memory issues that seriously affect applications that need to do work off the <span class="No-Break">main thread.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Slow adoption of features</strong>:  The Java release cycle is slow and it is difficult to use the latest Java version to develop Android apps as there’s a lot to be done to ensure backward compatibility. This means it’s hard for Android developers to easily adopt the new language features and improvements as they’re stuck using <span class="No-Break">older versions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lack of functional support</strong>: Java is not a functional language, which makes it hard for developers to write functional code in Java. It’s hard to employ features such as high-order functions or treat functions as <span class="No-Break">first-class citizens.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Over the years, Kotlin has evolved to be multiplatform and server-side and not serviced, and is used in data science as well. Some of the features where Kotlin has an edge over Java are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Conciseness</strong>: The syntax is<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> concise, which in turn reduces the amount of boilerplate code that <span class="No-Break">you write.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Null safety</strong>: Many Java developers are very familiar with the famous <strong class="bold">Null Pointer Exception</strong> that was a <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>source of many bugs and issues in applications.  Kotlin was designed with null safety in mind. Variables that can have null values are indicated when declaring them, and before using these variables, the Kotlin compiler enforces checks for <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>nullability, thereby reducing the number of exceptions <span class="No-Break">and crashes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Coroutines support</strong>: Kotlin has built-in support for Kotlin coroutines. Coroutines are lightweight threads that you can use to perform asynchronous operations. It’s easy to understand and use them in <span class="No-Break">your applications.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data classes</strong>: Kotlin has a built-in data class construct that makes it easy to define classes that are used primarily to store data. Data classes automatically generate <strong class="source-inline">equals()</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">hashCode()</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">toString()</strong> methods, reducing the amount of boilerplate <span class="No-Break">code required.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Extension functions</strong>: Kotlin allows developers to add functions to existing classes without inheriting from them, through extension functions. This makes it easier to add functionality to existing classes and reduces the need for <span class="No-Break">boilerplate code.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Smart casting</strong>: Kotlin’s smart casting system makes it possible to cast variables without the need for an explicit cast. The compiler automatically detects when a variable can be safely cast and performs the <span class="No-Break">cast automatically.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>JetBrains is also the company behind IntelliJ IDEA. The language support in this <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) is <span class="No-Break">also</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/></span><span class="No-Break"> great.</span></p>
			<p> Kotlin has evolved over the years to support the following <span class="No-Break">different platforms:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kotlin Multiplatform</strong>: This is<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> used to develop applications that target different platforms such as Android, iOS, and <span class="No-Break">web applications</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kotlin for server side</strong>: This is<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> used to write backend applications and a number of frameworks to support <span class="No-Break">server-side development</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kotlin for Android</strong>: Google<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> has supported Kotlin as a first-class language for Android develop<a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>ment <span class="No-Break">since 2017</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kotlin for JavaScript</strong>: This provides support for writing Kotlin code that is transpiled to compatible <span class="No-Break">JavaScript</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/></span><span class="No-Break"> libraries</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kotlin/Native</strong>: This compiles Kotlin <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>code to native binaries and runs<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> without a <strong class="bold">Java Virtual </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Machine</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">JVM</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kotlin for data science</strong>: You can <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>use Kotlin to build and explore <span class="No-Break">data pipelines</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In summary, Kotlin provides a more modern and concise approach to programming than Java while still maintaining interoperability with existing Java libraries and code. In addition, you can write Kotlin code and target <span class="No-Break">different platforms.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have got the gist of Kotlin and its various features, let’s move on to the next section where we will understand Kotlin as a programming language and understand Kotlin syntax, types, functions, <span class="No-Break">and classes.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-19">Kotlin <a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>syntax, types, functions and classes</h1>
			<p>In this section, we’ll be looking at<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> Kotlin syntax and familiarize ourselves with the language. Kotlin is a strongly typed language. The type of a variable is determined at the time of compilation. Kotlin has a rich type system that has the <span class="No-Break">following types:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Nullable types</strong>: Every type in <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>Kotlin can either be nullable or non-nullable. Nullable types are denoted with a question mark operator – for example, <strong class="source-inline">String?</strong>. Non-nullable types are normal types without any operator at the end – for <span class="No-Break">example, </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">String</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Basic types</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> types are similar to Java. Examples include Int, Long, Boolean, Double, <span class="No-Break">and Char.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Class types</strong>: As Kotlin is an object-oriented programming language, it provides support for classes, sealed <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>classes, interfaces, and so on. You define a class using the <strong class="source-inline">class</strong> keyword and you can add methods, properties, <span class="No-Break">and constructors.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Arrays</strong>: There is support for both <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>primitive and object arrays. To declare a primitive array, you specify the type and size, <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span><pre class="source-code">
val shortArray = ShortArray(10)</pre><p class="list-inset">The following shows how you define <span class="No-Break">object arrays:</span></p><pre class="source-code">val recipes = arrayOf("Chicken Soup", "Beef Stew", "Tuna Casserole")</pre><p class="list-inset">Kotlin automatically infers the type when you don’t <span class="No-Break">specify it.</span></p></li>				<li><strong class="bold">Collections</strong>: Kotlin has a<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> rich collection of APIs providing types such as sets, maps, and lists. They’re designed to be concise and expressive, and the language offers a wide range of operations for sorting, filtering, mapping, and <span class="No-Break">many more.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enum types</strong>: These are <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>used to define a fixed set of options. Kotlin has the <strong class="source-inline">Enum</strong> keyword for you to <span class="No-Break">declare enumerations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Functional types</strong>: Kotlin is a<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> functional language as well, meaning functions are treated as first-class citizens. You can be able to assign functions to variables, return functions as values from functions, and pass functions as arguments to other functions. To define a function as a type, you use the <strong class="source-inline">(Boolean) -&gt; Unit</strong> shorthand notation. This example takes a <strong class="source-inline">Boolean</strong> argument and returns a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Unit</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> value.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We’ve learned the different types available in Kotlin, and we’ll use this knowledge in the next section to define some of <span class="No-Break">these types.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Creating a Kotlin project</h2>
			<p>Follow these steps to create<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> your first <span class="No-Break">Kotlin project:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open IntelliJ IDEA. On the welcome screen, click on <strong class="bold">New Project</strong>. You’ll be presented with a dialog to create your new project as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following figure:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19779_01_01.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 – New Project dialog" width="780" height="609"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – New Project dialog</p>
			<p class="list-inset">Let’s work through the options in the dialog shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.1 </em><span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li class="upper-roman">You start by giving the project a name. In this case, <span class="No-Break">it’s </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">chapterone</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li class="upper-roman">You also specify the location of your project. This is normally where you store your working projects. Change the directory to your <span class="No-Break">preferred one.</span></li>
				<li class="upper-roman">Next, specify your target language from the options provided. In this case, we opt <span class="No-Break">for </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Kotlin</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li class="upper-roman">In the next step, specify your build system. We <span class="No-Break">specify </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Gradle</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li class="upper-roman">We also <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>need to specify the Java version that our project is going to use. In this case, it’s <span class="No-Break">Java </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">11</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li class="upper-roman">Next, you specify the Gradle DSL to use. For this project, we’ve chosen to <span class="No-Break">use </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Kotlin</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li class="upper-roman">Lastly, you specify the group and artifact IDs that, when combined, form a unique identifier for <span class="No-Break">your project.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Click on <strong class="bold">Create</strong> to finalize creating your new project. The IDE will create your project, which might take a <a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>few minutes. Once done, you’ll see your project <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer018" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19779_01_02.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2 – Project structure" width="911" height="426"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2 – Project structure</p>
			<p class="list-inset">The IDE creates the project with the project structure seen in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em>. We are mostly interested in the <strong class="source-inline">src/main/kotlin</strong> package, which is where we’ll add our <span class="No-Break">Kotlin files.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Start by right-clicking the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">src/main/kotlin</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> package.</span></li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">New</strong> and then <strong class="bold">New Kotlin Class/File</strong>. Select the <strong class="bold">File</strong> option from the list that appears<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> and name the file <strong class="source-inline">Main</strong>. The IDE will generate a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Main.kt</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> file.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that we’ve created our first Kotlin project and added a Kotlin file, in the next section, we will create functions in <span class="No-Break">this file.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Creating functions</h2>
			<p>In Kotlin, a function is a block of code that does a specific task. We use the <strong class="source-inline">fun</strong> keyword to define functions. Function<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> names should be in camel case and descriptive to indicate what the function is doing. Functions can take arguments and <span class="No-Break">re<a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>turn values.</span></p>
			<p>Create the <strong class="source-inline">main()</strong> function in your <strong class="source-inline">Main.kt</strong> file <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
fun main() {
    println("Hello World!")
}</pre>			<p>In the preceding code, we’ve used the <strong class="source-inline">fun</strong> keyword to define a function with the name <strong class="source-inline">main</strong>. Inside the function, we have a <strong class="source-inline">println</strong> statement that prints the message <strong class="source-inline">"</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Hello Word!"</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>You can run the function by pressing the green run icon to the right of the function.  You’ll see the console window pop up, displaying the message <strong class="source-inline">"</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Hello World!"</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>We’ve learned how to create functions and print output to the console. In the next section, we’ll learn how to create classes <span class="No-Break">in Kotlin.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Creating classes</h2>
			<p>To declare a class<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> in Kotlin, we have the <strong class="source-inline">class</strong> keyword. We’re going to create a <strong class="source-inline">Recipe</strong> class <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
class Recipe {
    private val ingredients = mutableListOf&lt;String&gt;()
    fun addIngredient(name: String) {
        ingredients.add(name)
    }
    fun getIngredients(): List&lt;String&gt; {
        return ingredients
    }
}</pre>			<p>Let’s break down the <span class="No-Break">preceding class:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>We’ve called the class <strong class="source-inline">Recipe</strong> and it has <span class="No-Break">no constructor.</span></li>
				<li>Inside the class, we have a member variable, <strong class="source-inline">ingredients</strong>, which is a <strong class="source-inline">MutableList</strong> of Strings. It’s mutable to allow us to add more items to the list. Defining variables in a class like this allows us to be able to access the variable anywhere in <span class="No-Break">the</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker028"/></span><span class="No-Break"> class.</span></li>
				<li>We have <strong class="source-inline">addIngredient(name: String)</strong>, which takes in a name as an argument. Inside the function, we add the argument to our <span class="No-Break">ingredients list.</span></li>
				<li>Lastly, we have the <strong class="source-inline">getIngredients()</strong> function, which returns an immutable list of strings. It simply returns the value of our <span class="No-Break">ingredients list.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>To be able to use the class, we have to modify our main function <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
fun main() {
    val recipe = Recipe()
    recipe.addIngredient("Rice")
    recipe.addIngredient("Chicken")
    println(recipe.getIngredients())
}</pre>			<p>The changes can be explained <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>First, we create a new instance of the <strong class="source-inline">Recipe</strong> class and assign it to the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">recipe</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> variable</span></li>
				<li>Then, we call the <strong class="source-inline">addIngredient</strong> method on the <strong class="source-inline">recipe</strong> variable and pass in the <span class="No-Break">string </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Rice</strong></span></li>
				<li>Again, we call the <strong class="source-inline">addIngredient</strong> method on the <strong class="source-inline">recipe</strong> variable and pass in the <span class="No-Break">string </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Chicken</strong></span></li>
				<li>Lastly, we call the <strong class="source-inline">getIngredients</strong> method on the <strong class="source-inline">recipe</strong> variable and print the result to <span class="No-Break">the console</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Run the main <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>function again and your output should be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer019" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19779_01_03.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3 – Recipes" width="692" height="172"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3 – Recipes</p>
			<p>As you can see from the preceding<a id="_idTextAnchor026"/> screenshot, the output is a list of ingredients that you added! Now you can prepare a nice rice and chicken meal, but <span class="No-Break">in Kotlin!</span></p>
			<p>Kotlin has tons of features and we’ve barely scratched the surface. You can check out the official Kotlin documentation (<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html">https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html</a>) as well to learn more. You’ll also learn <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>more features as you go deeper into <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p>We’ve learned how to create classes, define top-level variables, and add functions to our class. This helps us understand how classes in Kotlin work. In the next section, we will learn how to migrate a Java class to Kotlin and some of the tools available to use in <span class="No-Break">the migration.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Migrating from Java to Kotlin</h1>
			<p>Are you a Java developer and <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>have your apps in Java? Are you wondering how<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> you could get started with Kotlin? Worry not, this is your section. Kotlin offers two ways <span class="No-Break">for you:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Java-to-Kotlin migration</strong>: The IDE that we are using, IntelliJ IDEA, has a tool for converting existing Java files <span class="No-Break">to Kotlin.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Interoperability</strong>: Kotlin is highly interoperable with Java code, meaning you can have both Java and Kotlin code in the same project. You can continue using your favorite Java libraries<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> in your <span class="No-Break">Kotlin projects.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s see how to migrate a<a id="_idIndexMarker034"/> sample Java class to Kotlin using <span class="No-Break">IntelliJ IDEA:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Inside <strong class="source-inline">src/main/kotlin</strong>, open the <strong class="source-inline">Song</strong> class, which has a number of <span class="No-Break">Java functions.</span></li>
				<li>Right-click the file and you’ll see the <strong class="bold">Convert Java to Kotlin</strong> option at the bottom. Select this and you’ll be presented the following <span class="No-Break">confirmation dialog:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="IMG---Figure">   </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer020" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19779_01_04.jpg" alt="Figure 1.4 – Confirmation dialog" width="405" height="132"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4 – Confirmation dialog</p>
			<p>At times after a conversion, you might need to make some corrections and that’s why we have this dialog. Click <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> to proceed and you’ll see your code is now in Kotlin. This is a useful feature that handles a major part of the conversion to Kotlin and you also learn about <span class="No-Break">the syntax.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve learned how to migrate Java code to Kotlin, in the next section we will cover some of the features of Kotlin that make it useful for <span class="No-Break">Android developers.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Kotlin features for Android developers</h1>
			<p>Now that you have had an introduction to Kotlin, let’s look at why Kotlin is a great language specifically for <span class="No-Break">Android development.</span></p>
			<p>Google announced Kotlin as a <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>first-class language for writing Android apps back in 2017. Since then, there has been lots of work done to make sure that developers have all they need to develop Android apps in Kotlin. Here are some of the features that developers can <span class="No-Break">benefit from:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improved developer productivity</strong>: Kotlin’s concise and expressive syntax can help developers write code faster and with fewer errors, which can ultimately improve <span class="No-Break">developer productivity.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Null safety</strong>: Since Kotlin is written with nullability in mind, it helps us to avoid crashes related to the Null <span class="No-Break">Pointer Exception.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">IDE support</strong>: IDE support has been continuously improving. Android Studio, which is built on top of IntelliJ IDEA, has been receiving tons of features such as improved autocompletion support to improve the <span class="No-Break">Kotlin experience.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Jetpack libraries</strong>: Jetpack libraries are available in Kotlin, and older ones are being rewritten with Kotlin. These are a set of libraries and tools to help Android developers write less code. They address common developer pain points and increase <span class="No-Break">developer efficiency.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Jetpack Compose</strong>: Jetpack Compose, a new UI framework, is completely written in Kotlin and takes advantage of features of the Kotlin language. It’s a declarative UI framework that makes it easy for Android developers to build beautiful UIs for <span class="No-Break">their apps.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kotlin Gradle DSL</strong>: You are now able to write your Gradle files <span class="No-Break">in Kotlin.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Coroutine support</strong>: A lot of Jetpack Libraries support coroutines. For example, the <strong class="source-inline">ViewModel</strong> class has <strong class="source-inline">viewModelScope</strong> that you can use to scope coroutines in the lifecycle of the <strong class="source-inline">ViewModel</strong>. This aligns with the Structured Concurrency principles for coroutines. This helps cancel all coroutines when they’re no longer needed. Some libraries including Room, Paging 3, and DataStore also support <span class="No-Break">Kotlin coroutines.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Support from Google</strong>: Google continues to invest in Kotlin. Currently, there are resources ranging from articles to code labs, documentation, videos, and tutorials from the Android DevRel team at Google to assist you in learning new libraries and architecture for <span class="No-Break">Android Development.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Activ<a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>e community and tooling</strong>: Kotlin has a vibrant and active community of developers, which <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>means that there are plenty of unofficial resources, libraries, and tools available to help with <span class="No-Break">Android development.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned about the Kotlin programming language and its features.
