    lot of cash can be cumbersome. Thus, many people rely on credit and debit cards
    instead.
  prefs: []

- en: Although credit and debit cards can be lost or stolen too, they're so much easier
    to carry than large amounts of cash. However, one huge problem with credit and
    debit cards is that their numbers can be stolen and used by thieves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To protect your credit and debit card numbers from thieves, Apple introduced
    Apple Pay. The main idea behind Apple Pay is that you use an existing credit or
    debit card, but instead of giving out that credit or debit card to merchants,
    you use Apple Pay instead, which hides your credit or debit card number. By protecting
    your credit or debit card number from merchants, Apple Pay reduces the threat
    of others stealing your crucial credit or debit card numbers by hacking into a
    merchant's network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since Apple Pay is linked to your iPhone, it requires Touch ID (your fingerprint)
    or Face ID (your face) to authorize payment either in person or online. So, not
    only does Apple Pay protect your credit or debit card numbers, but it also prevents
    anyone from getting access to your credit or debit card numbers stored on your
    iPhone. Apple Pay offers a safe and secure way to make purchases.
