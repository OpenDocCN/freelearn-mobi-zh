- en: When you're away from your desk, it's easy to get a sudden inspiration and need
    to capture your idea. Far too often, people forget their ideas completely. Other
    times, you may need to jot your ideas down on any scrap of paper you can find,
    such as a paper napkin or the back of an envelope. Ideally, you should carry a
    notepad and pen or pencil at all times since you never know when a good idea might
    hit you and you'll need to write it down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fortunately, with your iPhone, you'll always have a way to record your ideas
    at any time in one of two ways. First, you can type ideas using the **Notes**
    app, which acts like a simple word processor for capturing small amounts of text.
    Second, you can dictate your ideas to the Voice Memos app so you can capture an
    audio file of your spoken thoughts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No matter where inspiration strikes you, you'll be able to record your thoughts
    as written text or spoken audio by using your iPhone. Now you just have to remember
    to keep your iPhone with you at all times.

    related notes, such as a folder for work projects and another folder for personal
    information. By creating and using folders, you can better organize your notes
    to help you find them again.
