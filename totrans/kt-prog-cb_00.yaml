    stuck with. Along with that, Kotlin Cookbook will also help developers learn handy
    tricks and concepts that they may need while coding. This book will also help
    developers uncover the full potential of an amazing programming language, that
    is, Kotlin.

- en: The book starts with an overview of Kotlin and moves on to some great simple
    concepts and features that Kotlin offers. From there, it will move on to OOP fundamentals
    and creating simple Android applications. Next will be the recipes for more complicated
    concepts such as networking, database, architectures, file io, and testing. It
    will also cover some great features of Anko that really eases out some complicated
    concepts in Android development, making it faster and more fun. Last will be some
    miscellaneous but extremely useful recipes that developers might need from time
    to time.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is targeted at Kotlin beginners who know Android and Java Development
    and who have a good knowledge level and understanding of the Android development
    cycle. The readers are familiar with the concepts of Android development and understand
    the needs of testing their code. They want to learn efficient Kotlin techniques
    in order to make the existing Android development process more efficient and fun.
    This *is not* an introductory book for Kotlin, and it assumes basic familiarity
    with Kotlin. This book aims at helping developers solve issues they are stuck
    with while working with Kotlin.
