- en: In the first part of this book, we will delve into .NET MAUI programming. We
    will begin with an introduction to .NET MAUI and its predecessor, Xamarin.Forms.
    Following that, we will create a code base using the Visual Studio template for
    our application. Throughout this book, we will develop a password manager app
    called PassXYZ.Vault, building it step by step. During the app’s development,
    we will cover user interface design using XAML, the MVVM pattern, data binding,
    Shell, and dependency injection, among other topics.

- en: By the end of *Part 1*, we will have completed a fully functional password manager
    application. In this part, we’ll explore some of the important groundwork for
    this application, such as using the .NET Community Toolkit in the context of MVVM
    and data binding. This will enable you to build and implement applications that
    involve handling high volumes of data effectively.
