<p id="e-wBz7">Facebook is the most popular social networking site in the world with the biggest user base of over 1 billion. Users trust the platform and are willing to interact with it through third-party applications. Applications that take advantage of the social platform features are more likely to go viral because of the different channels provided by the Facebook Platform.</p>
<p id="e-xYei">This book will focus on the Facebook Platform's concepts and feature implementation. The Facebook iOS SDK will be used to create a new social application that will enable users to take advantage of the multiple features available through their APIs.</p>
<h1 id="e-YHEE">What this book covers</h1>
<p id="e-e4XA">Chapter 1, <em>Introduction to the Facebook Platform</em>, describes the concepts of social network platforms and the different functionalities available on the social network. Here we will learn how the social network is structured and how different pieces interact with each other.</p>
<p id="e-k0Y5">Chapter 2, <em>Creating a New iOS Social Project</em>, describes how to create a new iOS application that will use the Facebook iOS SDK and APIs. We will learn how to set a new iOS XCode project that will enable users to interact with the social platform. A part of the setup will involve creating a new Facebook App ID and downloading the iOS SDK.</p>
<p id="e-Avt6">Chapter 3, <em>Connecting to a Facebook User Account</em>, describes how to set up our application in order to authenticate users using their Facebook credentials. We will learn how to lay out a new interface to allow users to provide their Facebook credentials and authenticate them against the interface in the social platform. A part of the UI implementation will use a new SDK component, <code>FBLoginView</code>. We will work with both the user login and logout flows.</p>
<p id="e-FgjS">Chapter 4, <em>Displaying User Profile</em>, describes which user information we can retrieve from the social network. We will learn how to fetch the user information upon successful user authentication. We will create a new user interface in order to display the data fetched from Facebook Platform.</p>
<p id="e-S57g">Chapter 5, <em>Posting on Walls</em>, describes how to interact with a Facebook user's wall. We will learn how to share an application-driven event on users' walls through the Facebook iOS SDK. We will use both native-based and web-based APIs. We will customize the implementation in order to choose the current logged users or any of their friends' walls.</p>
<p id="e-PEeY">Chapter 6, <em>Facebook Graph API</em>, describes how to interact with the social platform using Graph APIs. Graph API is the main tool to query and fetch information from the platform. We will learn how to use Graph API to debug application requests in order to validate queries and responses and how to implement Graph APIs using the Facebook iOS SDK.</p>
<p id="e-A2re">Chapter 7, <em>Distributing Your Social Application</em>, describes how to make your application go viral among many users. Here we will learn how to use Facebook's distribution channels in order to share our new iOS social application with our Facebook friends. We will take care of setting up all the necessary information on Facebook App Profile in order to create a flawless sharing experience.</p>
<p id="e-dhBk">Chapter 8, <em>Promoting Your Social Application</em>, describes how to use Facebook tools to promote and keep track of our social application users and usage. Here we will learn to use the Facebook Insight tool. Part of this chapter will focus on growing our application audience using mobile and web ads.</p>

<h1 id="e-BT0A">What you need for this book</h1>
<p id="e-t6f6">In order to start with Facebook iOS SDK development, you should have a Mac OS machine with XCode. In order to register your application on the Facebook Social Graph, you will need a Facebook account. Additionally, to deliver and promote your application to the world, you need a developer account with Apple.</p>

<h1 id="e-zE4x">Who this book is for</h1>
<p id="e-S9Ee">This book is written for iOS developers ranging from novice to experts. I will definitely recommend reading the Storyboard reference from the Apple website. This book uses Objective-C, Storyboard, and Facebook iOS SDK.</p>
