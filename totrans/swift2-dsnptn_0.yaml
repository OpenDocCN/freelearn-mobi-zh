    as described by the gang of four (GoF), with the new language provided by Apple:
    Swift.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The main idea behind this book is to make it a reference book for implementing
    a specific pattern. This is the reason why I have divided this book into three
    categories: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. For each category,
    you will find a chapter with a common structure: roles, a UML class diagram, participants,
    collaboration, illustration, and implementation with Swift.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This structure is an easy way to find the answers that you may ask yourself.
    In this book, I will first introduce you to the five creational patterns, followed
    by seven structural patterns, and then conclude with the eleven behavioral patterns,
    as defined by the GoF.

- en: This book will help you learn about the difference between a low-level programmer
    and a programmer with design pattern knowledge. You can apply this knowledge with
    Swift in Xcode to design scalable and flexible apps or games for iOS and Mac.
    As design patterns are not the exclusive reserve of Swift, but can be used by
    any other language, this is the knowledge that any developer and software architect
    must have.
