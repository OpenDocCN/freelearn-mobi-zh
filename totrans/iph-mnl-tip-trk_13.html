			<p>Whether you're at work, in school, or just enjoying your life, you'll likely run into people you'll want to contact in the future. In the old days, you might exchange business cards or phone numbers on a piece of paper, but it's far simpler and more accurate to store someone's name and contact information in your iPhone instead.</p>
			<p>Not only can your iPhone keep track of all the important names, phone numbers, and email addresses you need, but your iPhone will also let you call, text, FaceTime, or email someone as well. With your iPhone, you can store information about friends, relatives, and co-workers that you can easily share with others as well. </p>
			<p>The topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Storing contact information</li>
				<li>Searching for a name</li>
				<li>Communicating through the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app</li>
				<li>Combining duplicate contacts</li>
				<li>Identifying special people</li>
				<li>Sharing contacts</li>
				<li>Deleting contacts</li>
				<li>Creating emergency contacts </li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor498"/><a id="_idTextAnchor499"/><a id="_idTextAnchor500"/><a id="_idTextAnchor501"/>Storing contact information</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app is a simple <a id="_idIndexMarker770"/>database where you can store as much information as you need about each person. At the very least, you need to store someone's first and last name, along with one way to contact that person, such as a mailing address, phone number, or email address. </p>
			<p>Once you store a person's name and contact information, you can optionally store any additional information you wish, such as the company where they work, their birthday, their favorite foods, the names of their children, or notes about their personality, which might come in handy when dealing with co-workers or clients. </p>
			<p>Unlike collecting business cards that you might lose, you'll always have your contact information as long as you have your iPhone. To protect your contact information, you can copy it to your Macintosh so you'll always have a copy, even if you lose your iPhone.</p>
			<p>First, let's take a look at how to store your own contact information. You'll want to keep your own contact information up to date to share with others.</p>
			<p>To create your own contact information, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app on the Home Screen. </li>
				<li>Tap your name at <a id="_idIndexMarker771"/>the top of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.1</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.1 – The Contacts screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor502"/><a id="_idTextAnchor503"/></p><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.1 – The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> (the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon) in the upper-right corner of the screen. Add your name, phone number, and any other information you want, such as an email address, mailing address, and any other information you want to save and share with others.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you have stored your own contact information, you can start adding other people's names and contact information as well. To add a new contact, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. A <strong class="bold">New Contact</strong> screen appears, enabling you<a id="_idIndexMarker772"/> to add contact information about a person, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.2</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.2 – The New Contact screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.2 – The New Contact screen</p></li>
				<li> Type in any<a id="_idIndexMarker773"/> information, such as a person's name and phone number. </li>
				<li>(Optional) Tap <strong class="bold">Add Photo</strong>. This lets you use a memoji to represent a person or use your iPhone camera to take a picture of someone, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.3</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.3 – Adding a picture to contact information&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.03_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.3 – Adding a picture to contact information</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app now stores your data.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you store one<a id="_idIndexMarker774"/> or more names and contact information, you'll likely want to find that information again. That means knowing all the different ways to search for information stored in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app<a id="_idTextAnchor504"/><a id="_idTextAnchor505"/>.</p>
			<p>Searching for a name</p>
			<p>The simplest way to<a id="_idIndexMarker775"/> look for a particular name in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app is to scroll down the entire list of contacts until you find the name you want. A second way is to tap a letter on the right side of the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> screen to jump to people whose last name begins with a certain letter, such as R or W. </p>
			<p>Yet an even faster method is to search for a name. That way, you can type just part of a name and see all possible matches. Searching can be particularly useful if you only know a person's first name or aren't sure of the complete spelling of someone's name.</p>
			<p>To search for a name in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap in the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> text field at the top of the screen.</li>
				<li>Type a few letters. Each time you type a letter, the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app narrows down the list of possible matches, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.4</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.4 – Searching for a name&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.4 – Searching for a nam<a id="_idTextAnchor506"/><a id="_idTextAnchor507"/>e</p></li>
				<li>Tap a name<a id="_idIndexMarker776"/> to display more information about that perso<a id="_idTextAnchor508"/><a id="_idTextAnchor509"/>n.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The more text you search for, the narrower the list of matches. However, if you aren't sure about the spelling of someone's name, type fewer characters and scroll through the list of matches.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor510"/>Communicating through the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app<a id="_idIndexMarker777"/> does more than just store names and contact information. You can also use the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app as a way to communicate with others. Normally, if you want to send an email, make a phone call, or send a text message, you'd have to type in that person's contact information.</p>
			<p>Since the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app already contains a person's contact information, all you need to do is open the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app, find the person you want to reach, and then choose the best method to reach that person, such as by email, FaceTime, phone call, or text message. </p>
			<p>To see how to use the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app to contact someone, follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the name of the person you wish to contact. That person's contact information appears on the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.5</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.5 – Viewing a person's contact information&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.5 – Viewing a person's contact information</p></li>
				<li>Tap a phone<a id="_idIndexMarker778"/> number or email address to make a phone call, send an email message, or make a FaceTime call. Tap the <strong class="bold">message</strong> icon to send a text message. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>By opening the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app first, you can choose who you want to contact without the hassle of typing in that person's phone number or email address. As long as you typed in a person's phone number or email address correctly, your iPhone can use that correct contact information to make a call or send an email message to others.</p>
			<p>The key to using<a id="_idIndexMarker779"/> the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app is to add in as much contact information about a person as possible because you never know how you may want to reach that person in the future.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor511"/>Combining duplicate contacts</h1>
			<p>On many an<a id="_idIndexMarker780"/> occasion, you may add information about a person and then suddenly realize that you have already added information about that person before, so you wind up with duplicate names but with different contact information. </p>
			<p>For example, imagine you meet someone at a party and get their name and email address. Later, you get in touch with that person to do business, so you enter that person's name, company, and phone number. At this point, you would have the same person stored twice.</p>
			<p>Creating duplicate information for a single person might be handy if you want to clearly separate someone's personal information from their business contact information. However in most cases, you might want to keep all contact information for a person under a single name. </p>
			<p>Fortunately if you find yourself with duplicate contact information for the same person, you can merge or link the two contact information screens into one. </p>
			<p>To see how to combine duplicate contacts, you'll first need to store a name in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. Then, you'll need to create a duplicate name to combine it with the existing contact information stored under the same name.</p>
			<p>To see how to combine contacts, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon. A <strong class="bold">New Contact</strong> screen appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 13.2</em>).</li>
				<li>Type a name (such as <code>John Doe</code>) and contact information (such as a phone number), tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>, and then tap the <strong class="bold">Back</strong> button to return to the list of all names stored in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. At this point, you have a single John Doe stored in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon. A <strong class="bold">New Contact</strong> screen appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 13.2</em>).</li>
				<li>Type the same name (such as <code>John Doe</code>) but different contact information (such as a different phone number).</li>
				<li>Scroll to the bottom of the <strong class="bold">New Contact</strong> screen to view the <strong class="bold">link contacts…</strong> button, as <a id="_idIndexMarker781"/>shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.6</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.6 – The link contacts button appears at the bottom of the New Contact screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.6 – The link contacts button appears at the bottom of the New Contact screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">link contacts…</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app screen appears again. However, the name you're currently editing will appear dimmed, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.7</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.7 – A dimmed name identifies the contact information you're currently editing&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.07_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.7 – A dimmed name identifies the contact information you're currently editing</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the non-dimmed <a id="_idIndexMarker782"/>duplicate name that you want to merge with the dimmed name. The non-dimmed name's contact information appears along with a <strong class="bold">Link</strong> button in the upper-right corner of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.8</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.8 – A Link button appears in the upper-right corner&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.08_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.8 – A Link button appears in the upper-right corner</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Link</strong> and then tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. The duplicate contact information now appears merged in a single name.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Eliminating duplicate names <a id="_idIndexMarker783"/>can streamline your contacts list. As you add more contacts, you'll likely have some people who are more important to you than others. To identify those special people, take some extra time to mark the names in your contacts list as extra special to you.</p>
			<p>Identifying special people</p>
			<p>Your contacts list will<a id="_idIndexMarker784"/> likely contain names of people you need to know and people you want to know. For those special people you care about the most, take a moment to identify those important people in your life in one of the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Birthdays</li>
				<li>Favorites </li>
			</ul>
			<p>By adding someone's birthday, you can see that person's birthday on the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app. If you regularly view the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app to see any appointments you might have for that day, you'll also see anyone's birthday as well.</p>
			<p>By designating someone as a favorite, you can create a favorite list in the <strong class="bold">Phone</strong> app so you can quickly <a id="_idIndexMarker785"/>find your favorite people and send them a text message or call them without the hassle of digging through your entire contact list.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor512"/>Displaying birthdays</h2>
			<p>To make the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app <a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>display somebody's birthday, you must define that person's birthday first. To define a birthday, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on a name you want to modify.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen. </li>
				<li>Scroll down until you find the <strong class="bold">add birthday</strong> button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.9</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.9 – The add birthday button&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.9 – The add birthday button</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">add birthday</strong>. A <a id="_idIndexMarker787"/>date picker appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.10</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.10 – A date picker for defining a birthday&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.10_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.10 – A date picker for defining a birthday</p></li>
				<li>Pick a date for <a id="_idIndexMarker788"/>that person's birthday and tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Navigate to the month that contains one of your contact's birthdays and tap on that date. A reminder for that person's birthday appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.11</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.11 – A birthday reminder on the Calendar app&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.11_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.11 – A birthday reminder on the Calendar app</p></li>
				<li>Tap the person's <a id="_idIndexMarker789"/>birthday reminder near the bottom of the Calendar screen. That person's contact information appears, allowing you to contact them by phone, FaceTime, email, or text message. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>If someone is important to you, you can designate them as a favorite. That way, you can get one-tap access to them when you want to call them using the <strong class="bold">Phone</strong> app.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor513"/>Defining favorites</h2>
			<p>Everyone has people<a id="_idIndexMarker790"/> they like best, so you can designate certain people as favorites. When you designate someone as a favorite, their name and phone number appear in the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> list in the <strong class="bold">Phone</strong> app. This lets you call that person from your short list of favorites rather than your entire list of contacts. </p>
			<p>To see how to define and use favorites, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on a name you want to modify. The <strong class="bold">Add to Favorites</strong> link appears near the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.12</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.12 – The Add to Favorites link&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.12 – The Add to Favorites link</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Add to Favorites</strong>. A menu appears letting you store someone's phone number for text messaging or phone calls, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.13</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.13 – Choosing a favorite way to contact someone&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.13_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.13 – Choosing a favorite way to contact someone</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Message</strong>, <strong class="bold">Call</strong>, <strong class="bold">Video</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> and <a id="_idIndexMarker791"/>then choose a phone number to use for text messaging or phone calls (if there is more than one phone number stored).</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Phone</strong> app and tap the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. A list of your favorite people appears. Now you can just tap on a name to send that person a text message or call them.</li>
				<li>(Optional) To remove a name from this <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> list, swipe left and tap the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> icon when it appears.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you collect more names and contact information, you may have valuable information that you may want to share with others. If you want to share your contact information with others, you<a id="_idIndexMarker792"/> can do so quickly and easily.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor514"/>Sharing contacts</h1>
			<p>When you have <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>someone's contact information, you may want to share it with others. While you could exhaustively read off someone's email address and phone number along with their social media contact information, it's much easier to simply send all this information to someone so they can load it into their own <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> database.</p>
			<p>To share a contact, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on a name you want to share with others. The <strong class="bold">Share Contact</strong> button appears near the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.14</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.14 – The Share Contact button&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.14 – The Share Contact button</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Share Contact</strong>. A list<a id="_idIndexMarker794"/> of people and ways in which to send contact information to them appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.15</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.15 – Choosing how to share contact information&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.15 – Choosing how to share contact information</p></li>
				<li>Tap a person or a method to send contact information, such as <strong class="bold">Messages</strong> or <strong class="bold">Mail</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sharing important contacts <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>can be crucial in business, but eventually you may find you no longer need certain names any more for both work and personal use. That's when you need to trim your contact list. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor515"/>Deleting contacts</h1>
			<p>No matter how <a id="_idIndexMarker796"/>valuable someone's contact information might be, eventually you may want to delete it because the person moves away or has changed jobs. When that occurs, you can delete a contact.</p>
			<p>In fact, you should periodically review your contact list to remove any names you no longer need to save. That way, you can keep a list of only the most important people in your life. </p>
			<p>To delete a contact, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on a name you want to delete. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> and scroll to the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete Contact</strong>. <strong class="bold">Delete Contact</strong> and <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> buttons appear at the bottom of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete Contact</strong>. Your iPhone deletes your chosen contact.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Perhaps one of the most<a id="_idIndexMarker797"/> important type of people in your contact list are those people authorities should contact in case you're hurt. That's when you need to define emergency contacts. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor516"/>Creating emergency contacts</h1>
			<p>If you should get in a<a id="_idIndexMarker798"/> car accident or fall ill for any reason and you're by yourself, nobody will know who to contact or what type of medical condition you might be in. That's why you should take a few moments to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Define your own medical information</li>
				<li>List your emergency contacts</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you define your own medical history and define a list of emergency contacts, anyone will be able to retrieve this crucial information from your iPhone's lock screen. That way, they don't need to talk to you or wait for you to unlock your iPhone.</p>
			<p>The first step is to define your own medical history, such as what type of medication you might be currently taking or what you might be allergic to, such as certain drugs or food. You can also define anything else you think might help first responders, such as your blood type.</p>
			<p>The second step is to define any people in your <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app whom first responders should contact, such as your spouse or parent. </p>
			<p>To define medical information for yourself, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap your own name at the top of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen. </li>
				<li>Scroll down and <a id="_idIndexMarker799"/>tap <strong class="bold">Create or Edit Medical ID</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Medical ID</strong> screen appears where you can enter your medical background, such as medication you're using or conditions you have, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.16</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.16 – The Medical ID screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.16_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.16 – The Medical ID screen</p><p>This information can <a id="_idIndexMarker800"/>then be accessed from the locked screen of your iPhone. That way, if you're in an emergency, a first responder can tap the <strong class="bold">Medical ID</strong> button on your iPhone's lock screen to view any medical information you may have saved.</p></li>
				<li>Scroll down until you see the <strong class="bold">Emergency Contacts</strong> category, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.17</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.17 – The Emergency Contacts category&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.17 – The Emergency <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> category</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">add emergency contact</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> screen<a id="_idIndexMarker801"/> appears. </li>
				<li>Tap on a name. A <strong class="bold">Relationship</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 13.18</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 13.18 – The Relationship screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_13.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 13.18 – The Relationship screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap a <a id="_idIndexMarker802"/>relationship, such as <strong class="bold">parent</strong> or <strong class="bold">spouse</strong>. Repeat <em class="italic">Steps 7 and 8</em> as often as necessary.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Nobody may ever need your medical information and emergency contacts, but it's better to be safe now just in case an emerge<a id="_idTextAnchor517"/>ncy occurs. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor518"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>At its simplest level, the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app can store names and contact information that you can retrieve at any time. With one tap, you can send an email message, make a phone or FaceTime call, or send a text message. If someone gives you their website or social media contact, you can reach that person that way as well. </p>
			<p>Besides storing names and contact information, you can also directly contact people from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. This saves you time typing an email address or phone number over and over again.</p>
			<p>Most importantly, store your own medical information along with emergency contacts. That way, if you're ever in an accident, authorities will be able to contact your loved ones and access your medical history.</p>
			<p>Storing names and contact information is important, but often you need this information when you need to call or meet certain people. So, in the next chapter, you'll learn about setting appointments and reminders. That way, you'll never be late or miss an appointment again.</p>
