    Android Studio 2.0 with all its varied features is ready to be explored. How would
    you like to make your own Android applications and make these applications available

    and help you take your first steps in the new environment. We will begin by preparing
    the system for the installation and downloading the required files. We will see
    the welcome screen that prompts when running Android Studio for the first time,
    and we'll configure the **Android Software Development Kit** (**SDK**) properly
    so that you have everything ready to create your first application.

- en: A prerequisite to start working with Android Studio is to have Java installed
    on your system. The system must also be able to find the Java installation. This
    can be achieved by installing the **Java Development Kit** (**JDK**) on your system
    and then setting an environment variable named `JAVA_HOME`, which points to the
    JDK folder in your system. Check this environment variable to avoid issues during
    the installation of Android Studio.

    Although, Android Studio automatically installs the latest Android SDK available,

    It is important to check it and learn how we can change it.
