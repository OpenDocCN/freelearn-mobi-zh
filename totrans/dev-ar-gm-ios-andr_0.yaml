- en: In this book, we will be introduced to augmented reality, and how to achieve
    it using powerful but simple tools. Using the free license of Vuforia and Unity
    3D, we will see how the two technologies can seamlessly entwine and produce amazing
    results. We will learn how to design a great augmented reality experience that
    will immerse users and not feel foreign when augmented on the real world. Augmented
    reality became increasingly reliable with recent advancements in the field; we
    will learn how to use that potential in most efficient way.
