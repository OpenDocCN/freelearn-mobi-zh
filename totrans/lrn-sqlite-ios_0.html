For those with SQL experience, it will be easier to understand and learn what it has to offer and the applications it can be used for. SQLite was released in 2000 has grown to be a well-used database for mobile device development.</p><p>Mr. D. Richard Hipp developed it on a battleship while he was at a company called General Dynamics. Initially used as storage, it was then developed using a B-tree implementation, which enhanced it and enabled the storage of rows and transactions.</p><p>This book gives you the opportunity to learn elements of SQLite, the mobile database; its interaction with the MAC operating system, Xcode; and the developer IDE for Apple apps and PhoneGap, which enables HTML5. It outlines how easy it is to work with SQLite.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to SQL and SQLite">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introduction to SQL and SQLite,</em> introduces you to the background of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the mobile database SQLite.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Database Design Concepts">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Database Design Concepts</em>, talks about the database concepts in SQLite.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Administering the Database">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Administering the Database</em>, introduces you to administering the SQLite database and makes you aware of the different components of this relational database.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Essentials of SQL">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Essentials of SQL</em>, this chapter talks about the essentials of SQL.
