- en: LevelDB is both the simplest and potentially most powerful database technology
    available across platforms and suitable for mobile use. This book teaches you
    all about LevelDB using iOS and OS X examples.

- en: If you need to store data in a persistent dictionary, build complex data structures
    that are hard to model in SQL, or just push performance boundaries, LevelDB provides
    the building blocks. To get beyond the basics, you need to understand the programming
    patterns that allow for more complex data modeling in a key-value store.

- en: This book provides the understanding and coding tools to get the most out of
    LevelDB. The principles it teaches can also be applied to other sorted key-value
    stores. The book is suited for programmers, but includes enough theory to be interesting
    for a DBA or software architect.
