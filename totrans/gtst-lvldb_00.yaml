- en: LevelDB is both the simplest and potentially most powerful database technology
    available across platforms and suitable for mobile use. This book teaches you
    all about LevelDB using iOS and OS X examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you need to store data in a persistent dictionary, build complex data structures
    that are hard to model in SQL, or just push performance boundaries, LevelDB provides
    the building blocks. To get beyond the basics, you need to understand the programming
    patterns that allow for more complex data modeling in a key-value store.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book provides the understanding and coding tools to get the most out of
    LevelDB. The principles it teaches can also be applied to other sorted key-value
    stores. The book is suited for programmers, but includes enough theory to be interesting
    for a DBA or software architect.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Downloading LevelDB and Building with OS
    X"), *Downloading LevelDB and Building with OS X*, goes in detail through the
    downloading and building of the open-source LevelDB including dealing with Unix
    idioms. It includes building a trivial OS X application to prove the database
    is working.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Installing LevelDB and Building for iOS"),
    *Installing LevelDB and Building for iOS,* repeats the library building process
    to get a LevelDB library for use in the simulator and on iOS devices. It includes
    building a trivial iOS application to prove the database is working.'

    Deleting Data"), *Basic Key-value Operations – Creating and Deleting Data*, teaches
    you a little C++ as you learn how to store, retrieve, and delete data in a LevelDB
    database.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Iteration and Searching Keys"), *Iteration
    and Searching Keys*, goes beyond reading exact keys to show you how to efficiently
    iterate through all or part of the database, in order. It introduces the concept
    of storing key values to refer to other records.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Using Objective-C"), *Using Objective-C*,
    introduces the three main Objective-C wrappers released for LevelDB and compares
    their use with each other as well as the traditional C++ API used in previous
    chapters.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Integrating with a Cocoa UI"), *Integrating
    with a Cocoa UI*, shows how a typical form-based application can have lists of
    records loaded from a database and maps text entry fields to store a database
    record using simple JSON arrays.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Debugging with REPLs and Command Lines"),
    *Debugging with REPLs and Command Lines*, provides some debugging tools to help
    inspect your database. It includes a general purpose web server library that can
    be integrated into any iOS application to provide a debugging interface.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Richer Keys and Data Structures"), *Richer
    Keys and Data Structures*, expands our simple GUI example with full record editing
    and different list sorting. It builds upon that example with a discussion of key
    design compared to SQL and custom key comparators.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. A Document Database"), *A Document Database*,
    builds a different example program to show schema design using an extension of
    the APLevelDB Objective-C wrapper. It also covers how the LevelDB folder can be
    treated as a single package to appear as one item in the finder.'
