- en: Swift is Apple's new programming language that was introduced at the Worldwide
    Developers Conference (WWDC) in 2014, alongside the integrated development environment
    Xcode 6 and iOS 8\. Swift was arguably the most significant announcement at WWDC
    2014, and very few people, including Apple insiders, were aware of the project's
    existence prior to it being announced.

- en: At WWDC 2015, Apple made another big splash when they announced Xcode 7 and
    Swift 2, which is a major enhancement to the Swift language. During WWDC, Chris
    Lattner said that a lot of the enhancements were based on direct feedback that
    Apple received from the development community.

- en: Swift can be thought of as Objective-C reimagined using modern concepts and
    safe programming patterns. In Apple's own words, Swift is like "Objective-C without
    the C". Chris, the creator of Swift, said that Swift took language ideas from
    Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to
    list.

- en: Apple has also stated that "Swift is a successor to the C and Objective-C languages".
    Therefore, it is imperative for iOS and OS X developers who want to keep their
    skills up to date to not only learn, but also master the Swift programming language.

- en: The first five chapters of this book will introduce the reader to the Swift
    programming language. These chapters will give the reader a solid understanding
    of the Swift programming language. The remainder of the book will cover more advanced
    topics such as concurrency, network development, protocol extensions, and design
    patterns that will help the reader master this language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is written in an example-based approach where each topic covered is
    backed by examples, which are written to reinforce the topic and show how to implement
    it within the reader's code.

    to keep the readers up to date with what is new with Swift. The blog will also
    be used to enhance and expand on the material in the book.

    the First Steps with Swift*, will introduce you to the Swift programming language
    and discuss what inspired Apple to create Swift. We''ll also go over the basic
    syntax of Swift and how to use Playgrounds to experiment and test Swift code.'

    and Operators"), *Learning about Variables, Constants, Strings, and Operators*,
    will introduce you to variables and constants in Swift and when to use them. There
    will be brief overviews of the most common variable types with examples on how
    to use them. We''ll conclude this chapter by showing examples of how to use the
    most common operators in the Swift language.'

    *Using Collections and Cocoa Data Types*, will explain Swift''s array, set, and
    dictionary collection types and show examples on how to use them. We''ll also
    show how to use Cocoa and Foundation data types with Swift.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Control Flow and Functions"), *Control Flow
    and Functions*, will show you how to use Swift''s control flow statements. These
    include looping, conditional, and control transfer statements. The second half
    of the chapter is all about functions and how to define and use them.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Classes and Structures"), *Classes and Structures*,
    is dedicated to Swift''s classes and structures. We''ll look at what makes them
    similar and what makes them different. We''ll also look at access controls and
    object-oriented design. We''ll close this chapter out by looking at memory management
    in Swift.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Using Protocols and Protocol Extensions"),
    *Using Protocols and Protocol Extensions*, will cover both protocols and protocol
    extensions in detail since protocols are very important to the Swift language,
    and having a solid understanding of them will help us write flexible and reusable
    code.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Writing Safer Code with Availability and
    Error Handling"), *Writing Safer Code with Availability and Error Handling*, will
    cover the new approach to error handling, which Apple included in Swift 2, in
    depth as well as the new availability feature. Error handling is the process of
    responding to and recovering from error conditions.'

    with XML and JSON Data*, will discuss what XML and JSON data are and their uses.
    We''ll then see several examples of how to parse and build XML and JSON data using
    Apple''s frameworks.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Custom Subscripting"), *Custom Subscripting*,
    will discuss how we can use custom subscripts in our classes, structures, and
    enumerations. Subscripts in Swift can be used to access elements in a collection.
    We can also define custom subscripts for our classes, structures, and enumerations.'

    Types*, will explain what optional types really are, what are the various ways
    to unwrap them, and optional chaining. For a developer who is just learning Swift,
    optional types can be one of the more confusing items to learn.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. Working with Closures"), *Working with
    Closures*, will teach us how to define and use closures in our code. Closures
    in Swift are similar to blocks in Objective-C except that they have a much cleaner
    and easier way of using syntax. We will conclude this chapter with a section on
    how to avoid strong reference cycles with closures.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 13](ch13.html "Chapter 13. Using Mix and Match"), *Using Mix and Match*,
    will explain mix and match and demonstrate how we can include Swift code in our
    Objective-C projects and Objective-C code in our Swift projects. With all of the
    apps and frameworks written in Objective-C, it was important to allow Swift and
    Objective-C code to work together.'

    style guide since most enterprises have style guides for the various languages
    that they develop in.'

- en: This book is intended for individuals looking for a book that will not only
    give them a solid introduction to the Swift programming language, but will also
    cover, in depth, the advanced topics such as ARC, design patterns, protocol extensions,
    and concurrency. This book is written for those developers who learn best by looking
    at, and working with, code because each concept covered in the book is backed
    by example code written to give the reader a good understanding of the current
    topic and demonstrate how to properly implement it.
