    ostensibly the best framework of Java, and Android, which has the greatest number
    of clients of any operating system. This book will help to you learn and develop
    a product-ready application on your own which will be lightweight, secure, powerful,
    and responsive.

- en: Before start learning about the Spring and Android, we will demonstrate examples
    and code from Kotlin, as this programming language is very new to developers.
    These days, Kotlin is so popular that Google has declared it the official language
    of Android. Moreover, the Spring language also supports Kotlin. In this book,
    we will figure out how to make a robust, secure, and intense server dependent
    on Spring in the Kotlin language, and use the substance and utilize of this server
    in an Android application as a client.

- en: In this chapter, you will learn how to set up the environment to create Spring
    and Android projects, including the required tools and applications. This will
    include going through steps with accompanying images for visualization purposes.
    The developers who know Java, at that point, will have some leeway since it is
    the common platform among Spring and Kotlin. We will demonstrate the code and
    models with Kotlin that runs on JVM. The Kotlin is designed by JetBrains. On the
    off-chance that you are new to Kotlin and Spring, being familiar with Java will
    allow you to write code in Kotlin with ease.
