    analyzing what other platforms are supported by Moai SDK.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moai SDK ships with example hosts for different platforms. It's recommended
    that you read and understand the code for the platform's hosts, so you are able
    to modify them. If you wish to add your own fancy advertising library, or integration
    with the next generation social network, you'll need to modify the host.

    You'll find both of them inside `moai-sdk/hosts/folder` (`vs2010` and `vs2008`).

- en: Open up the correct solution for your Visual Studio version. Inside, you'll
    find all the code you need for the **GlutHost**, which should run smoothly on
    windows. Moai SDK already ships with a compiled version of this host in `moai-sdk/bin/win32/`.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The codebase for this host is basically the same as for the Windows one; it
    uses the GlutHost program with some considerations to make it work on Mac OS X.

    (or `.bat`). Be sure to have Apache Ant installed and all the Android stuff as
    well. Take a look at the wiki page for more information regarding building your
    game in Android ([http://getmoai.com/wiki/index.php?title=Building_Moai_Games_For_Android_Devices](http://getmoai.com/wiki/index.php?title=Building_Moai_Games_For_Android_Devices)).

- en: Compiling for Android could be a whole chapter by itself. Besides the mentioned
    link in Moai SDK wiki, you'll also need some knowledge of Android development,
    so it's recommended that you head over and read Android's documents before trying
    to build the host ([http://developer.android.com/develop/index.html](http://developer.android.com/develop/index.html)).

    is a new way to introduce code that runs natively in the computer and that can
    be downloaded from your Chrome browser. Moai SDK comes with a host built for it,
    which can be found in `moai-sdk/hosts/chrome`.

- en: The second method is preferred for now since it has Untz support, but official
    Linux support is on the way, so double check the latest Moai SDK release to verify
    that Linux is not yet officially supported.

    be easy to port to whatever platform that supports C++ and OpenGL. If you are
    able to get it working for a new platform, you can share your experience and send
    a pull request to [https://github.com/moai/moai-dev](https://github.com/moai/moai-dev).
    We will all be grateful!
