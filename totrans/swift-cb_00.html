<p><span>Since Apple announced the Swift programming language at WWDC 2014, it has gone on to become one of the fastest-growing programming languages. Swift is modern, open-source, and easy to use, and therefore</span><span> </span><span>its usefulness can extend beyond Apple's ecosystem, giving it the potential to be used across all platforms and for any scenario.</span></p>&#13;
<p><span>Swift 5.3 is the latest version of this exciting new programming language, giving you the tools to build performant and responsive apps with safe and clean code.</span></p>&#13;
<p>This book will guide you through Swift's features, building up your knowledge and toolset layer by layer, so you can use Swift to build the next great app or service.</p>&#13;
<p>You will be given useful, easy-to-follow recipes for using Swift to accomplish real-world tasks. Each recipe only uses concepts previously covered in the book so you will never feel lost.</p>&#13;
<p>Learn what makes Swift one of the fastest-growing and most exciting programming languages available today.</p>&#13;
<h1 id="uuid-cc97dec9-2e5d-4d8a-9ef0-48a951ee683e">Who this book is for</h1>&#13;
<p><span>If you are looking for a book to help you learn about the diverse features offered by Swift 5, along with tips and tricks to efficiently code and build applications, then this book is for you. Knowledge of Swift or general programming concepts will be beneficial.</span></p>&#13;
<h1 id="uuid-0f18e7ab-1d68-4a9c-8aa6-feacda42ee91">What this book covers</h1>&#13;
<p><a href="f9d48715-ffca-464f-95bf-722958f02e72.xhtml"/><a href="f9d48715-ffca-464f-95bf-722958f02e72.xhtml">Chapter 1</a><em>,</em> <em>Swift Building Blocks,</em> introduces you to the basic building blocks of Swift 5, its syntax, and the functionalities of basic Swift constructs. Also, this chapter will introduce you to Appleâ€™s Xcode IDE and Swift Playgrounds, which provides an ideal way to create, execute, debug, and understand the recipes contained in this book, thus setting you <span>up</span><span> </span><span>to initiate the development process. In this chapter, you will learn how to write your first Swift program and understand the various basic elements of the Swift language.   </span></p>&#13;
<p><a href="67605929-e031-49f6-83a9-9f7352e9bad3.xhtml">Chapter 2</a><em>,</em> <em>Mastering the Building Blocks,</em> teaches you how to create more complex structures on the basis of the building blocks that you studied in the first chapter and the functionalities provided by the Swift standard library. You will get an understanding of how to bundle variables into tuples, order data with the help of an array, and store key-value pairs with dictionaries. You will also learn how to use the property observers and control the access to and visibility of your code. Then, you will learn how to extend the functionalities of your code using the extensions.  </p>&#13;
<p><a href="d72c34de-445b-45b7-9a25-c16ba63e1c64.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <a href=""/><em>Data Wrangling with Swift Control Flow</em>, will teach you that programming is all about making decisions, therefore in this chapter, we will explore how to make decisions on the basis of the information gained and how to alter the control flow of the code. You will learn how to conditionally execute your code with<span> </span><kbd>if</kbd>/<kbd>else</kbd><span> </span>statements. You will also learn how to control the flow of execution of your code with<span> </span><kbd>switch</kbd><span> </span>statements, and then loop this code by understanding how to use<span> </span><kbd>for</kbd><span> </span>and<span> </span><kbd>while</kbd><span> </span>loops. You will then understand how to handle Swift errors with <kbd>try</kbd>,<span> </span><kbd>throw</kbd>,<span> </span><kbd>do</kbd><span>, </span>and<span> </span><kbd>catch</kbd><span> </span>statements. Also, we will cover how a<span> </span><kbd>defer</kbd><span> </span>statement can be useful to change state once a function's execution is complete or to clean up values that are no longer needed.  </p>&#13;
<p><a href=""/><a href="abdc6918-3b36-4495-9c61-f2b9551dd700.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <a href=""/><em>Generics, Operators, and Nested Types,</em> provides you with an understanding of two advanced features of Swift, which are generics and operators. Using these features, you will learn how to build functionalities that are flexible and well defined. Also, you will understand how nested types allow logical grouping, access, and namespacing for your constructs.</p>&#13;
<p><a href=""/><a href="a632f18a-5826-4757-90bc-7701c78edaaf.xhtml"/><a href="a632f18a-5826-4757-90bc-7701c78edaaf.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>,<em> Beyond the Standard Library,</em> takes you on a journey to explore the functionalities beyond the standard library provided by frameworks such as Foundation and UIKit. Learning how to use these functionalities will help you make full use of the Swift language.</p>&#13;
<p><a href="32abd392-d947-461c-a9e9-912b34704c9b.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a><span>,</span> <span><em>Building iOS Apps with Swift</em></span><span><em>,</em></span> is where <span><span>we'll start the journey into building our very own iOS app. Taking everything we've learned and more from the previous chapters' recipes, this chapter will teach you how to get off the ground using Swift to build an iOS app. </span></span></p>&#13;
<p><a href="f87c71fa-d2b0-44c4-9d33-65f438d69a15.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Swift Playgrounds,</em> is where you will gain a total understanding of using Swift Playgrounds and explore advanced features other than those explored in previous chapters, to create fully interactive experiences.   </p>&#13;
<p><a href="9ce1feb3-8fca-4656-91dc-796ba77c3d07.xhtml">Chapter 8</a><em>,</em> <em>Server-Side Swift</em>, introduces you to a totally different aspect of Swift programming: server-side programming with Swift. Also, you will gain an understanding of how to run Swift on Linux by installing the Swift toolchain. You will learn how to use a web server framework to build a REST API and how to host your API via a hosting service. You will also learn how to accomplish your tasks easily by understanding how to use Vapor, one of the most popular frameworks of Swift 5.</p>&#13;
<p><a href="f9e2c873-c2b2-4d40-9b02-5d884006d1a5.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Performance and Responsiveness in Swift,</em> explores the more advanced concepts of Swift programming to provide an understanding of how certain Swift types are implemented and their performance characteristics. Also, you will learn how to perform asynchronous tasks using the Grand Central Dispatch API. Then, we'll explore the multi-threaded environment available on all Apple platforms and how to enhance the performance profile of your Swift constructs to build a fast and responsive app.<span> </span></p>&#13;
<p><a href="30f08984-5b97-43e0-ad44-ca47f16ca183.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <em>SwiftUI and Combine Framework</em><em>,</em> <span><span>dives straight into Apple's new UI framework, SwiftUI. With SwiftUI, we'll learn how to create iOS apps by exploring the declarative syntax used to achieve this. We'll also explore how easy it is for SwiftUI and UIKit to work together. In addition to SwiftUI, we'll also explore the basics of the new Combine framework and how this works alongside SwiftUI.</span></span></p>&#13;
<p><a href="a98779ce-312f-4133-9859-45c215901821.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a><span>,</span> <em>Using CoreML and Vision in Swift</em><span><em>,</em></span><span><span> will dive into the frameworks offered by Apple and how we can use Swift code to harness machine learning techniques, as</span></span><span> machine learning is becoming an increasingly hot topic</span><span>. In this chapter, we'll cover CoreML and the Vision frameworks, using pre-trained models to identify objects in real time.</span></p>&#13;
