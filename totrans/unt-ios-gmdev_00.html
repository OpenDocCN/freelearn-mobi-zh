While there are several viable solutions for developing games for this platform, Unity has emerged as a leading platform for iOS and other platforms as well. With Unity's toolset, and this book, you will take the first steps on your journey to producing commercial quality games for the iOS platform.</p><p>This book takes a learning approach, focusing specifically on those things that are necessary to building an iOS title. From designing (from the mobile perspective) to scripting and creating game mechanics that are iOS centric, you will learn everything you need to get started. Throughout the course of the book you will build on lessons to design and publish a game with integrations to all of the components necessary to make a revenue generating title.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec06"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>As iOS development is only officially supported on the OSX platform, you will need a machine that runs OSX, the XCode development tools, and a subscription to Apple's Development Program. You can find details for XCode and the Apple iOS Developer Program here:<a class="ulink" href="http://developer.apple.com"> http://developer.apple.com</a>.</p><p>Information for joining the iOS Developer Program, the Terms of Use, and other policies not specifically covered in this book, can be found there.</p><p>You also need access to the Unity development platform and the iOS plugin, which can be obtained at:<a class="ulink" href="http://www.unity3d.com"> http://www.unity3d.com</a>.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec07"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>If you are a developer who is interested in developing games for the iOS platform and want to leverage the Unity platform, this book will provide the core knowledge that you need to get started. If you are a Unity developer looking to port an existing application to the mobile platform, this book will give you an overview of the processes involved in publishing specifically with the Unity iOS plugin.</p><p>Having an understanding of C# or Javascript will help, but if you are an experienced developer with either of these languages, you will still learn how to apply your skills to learn mobile development using this book, because much of the book is geared to an exploration of the concepts and implementation with Unity and the iOS platform.</p><p>The example code in this book is written primarily in C#. However, there are scenarios where Javascript is used as an instructional aid. While there is sufficient information to learn the necessary components of C# within the book, it is not a goal of the book to teach C# or its fundamentals.</p></div>
