Within just a few short pages you will take your first few steps towards becoming an iOS developer with UDK. But before we dive in head first, let's take a moment to learn just how UDK came to be in the first place and get everything set up to make your experience the best that it can be.</p></blockquote></div><p>In this chapter we will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Learn about the Unreal Engine and what we expect to create</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Install UDK on our computer</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Go through an overview of UDK's directories</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Download and install UDK Remote</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Match the Mobile Previewer settings with your iOS device</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Describe the project we are going to be creating</li></ul></div><p>Now that we have a firm grounding in what it is that we need as well as an overview of what the whole book is about, let's get started with the first thing we need to do, installing the program.</p><p>This first chapter is dedicated to offering a brief overview, from a beginner's point of view, of the exciting world that is UDK development for iOS.</p><p>During this chapter, we will be covering exactly what UDK is and how it came to enjoy its current popularity, including its evolution from prior versions of Epic Games' proprietary games development software.</p><p>Additionally, we'll be looking at what not to expect if you complete all the work showcased in this book. If you think you will be developing the next<span class="emphasis"><em> Gears of War</em></span> game on your phone, for example, then I am afraid you're in for a bit of a surprise!</p><p>We will also be looking at how to install and run UDK on your machine and then make certain you are ready for iOS development. A key part of this is the Unreal Remote/Mobile Previewer functionality UDK offers, which we will be looking at in all its illustrated detail in this very chapter.</p><p>Finally, we'll be looking at the basic concept of the prototype game we will develop called Urban Warrior, which, yes, as mentioned previously, is not the next<span class="emphasis"><em> Gears Of War</em></span> sequel, but at the same time will carry a lot of characteristics of a typical third-person shooter title which we all know and love!</p><div class="section" title="Defining UDK"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec01"/>Defining UDK</h1></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Unreal Development Kit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UDK</strong></span>) is a freely available version of Epic Games, a very popular Unreal game development engine.<a class="indexterm" id="id0"/>
</p><p>First developed in 1998 to power the original Unreal game, the engine (which is C++ based) has gone from strength to strength, and has not only formed the backbone of household-name Epic Games titles, such as the very popular<span class="emphasis"><em> Gears Of War</em></span> series, but has also been very successfully licensed out to third-party developers. Consequent titles range from<span class="emphasis"><em> Batman: Arkham City</em></span> to<span class="emphasis"><em> Mass Effect 3</em></span>, many of which are as equally successful as the games developed by its parent company.<a class="indexterm" id="id1"/>
</p><p>Currently, the Unreal engine itself is in its fourth iteration and is considered to be a top of the range visualization tool. It is not only used in the gaming industry, but has also been used for doing any kind of work that demands real-time computer graphics. UDK uses Unreal Engine 3, but it is still a powerhouse in itself and is quite capable of delivering amazing experiences on iOS software.<a class="indexterm" id="id2"/>
</p><p>The offering of UDK as a concept has evolved from Epic Games content generation tools very early on with Unreal titles; tools which proved to spawn a very healthy and thriving modification (modding) community. Originally, tools like these, such as UnrealEd (the editor tool with which a user can create their own in-game level), were available to anyone who bought the game.</p><p>In 2009, however, Epic turned that logic on its head by making their tools available to anybody, whether they owned an Unreal game or not. This proved to be a very successful move which expanded the Unreal developer user base thoroughly.</p><p>More recently Epic Games, as part of their constant and persistent updates of UDK, have added iOS functionality (in 2010), making sure that UDK can provide games for the ever-expanding mobile customer base that the iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch devices by Apple introduced. This was first demonstrated to the public by a live tech demo called<span class="emphasis"><em> Epic Citadel</em></span>; a freely available download on the iTunes store which played like an interactive walkthrough of a medieval town. This attracted a record number of downloads as at that time it was truly groundbreaking to experience high quality real-time graphics on a mobile device. Take a look at the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Defining UDK" src="graphics/image_1901_01_01.jpg" width="360"/></div><p>In fact, although it is not within the scope of this book, very recently certain demos have surfaced highlighting a potential UDK / Adobe Flash Player pipeline, showcasing the very impressive penetration this games development application has made to a number of different platforms.<a class="indexterm" id="id3"/>
</p><p>Of course, we are interested in iOS here, and we'll be covering that extensively in this book, starting from the bare basics and moving on to some more advanced concepts.</p><p>So what is it that we need to know about UDK and its mobile iOS limitations? Does it have any?</p><div class="section" title="Don't expect to make Gears of War"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec01"/>Don't expect to make Gears of War</h2></div></div></div><p>Let's start with a fairly realistic statement; we can't make an AAA gaming title as seen on a contemporary console or PC, such as<span class="emphasis"><em> Gears of War</em></span>, on iOS using UDK! It is a general limitation of doing mobile development using UDK.<a class="indexterm" id="id4"/>
</p><p>The main reason for this is rather obvious; we just do not have access to the same hardware. The problem is not the software! UDK can deploy the same game on a PC or an iOS device, but it is the end-hardware specification that has the final say in what can be handled in real-time or not.</p><p>Mobile devices (and this of course includes iOS devices) have progressed by leaps and bounds over the last few years, and after many false starts mobile gaming today is a force to be reckoned with, both commercially and technologically. That still, however, does not change the fact that as an iOS UDK developer, you will work with more restricted hardware as opposed to, for example, someone developing for an Xbox 360 platform.<a class="indexterm" id="id5"/>
</p><p>Let's look at this in more detail; these are some of the current iPhone 4S technical specifications:<a class="indexterm" id="id6"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">960 x 640 pixel display</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB Flash drive</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Dual-core 1 GHz Cortex-A9PowerVRSGX543MP2GPU</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">512 MB RAM</li></ul></div><p>The newest iPad released in early 2012 has the following specifications:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">2048 x 1056 pixel display<a class="indexterm" id="id7"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB Flash drive</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Quad-core PowerVRSGX543MP4GPU</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">1 GB RAM</li></ul></div><p>While these specs are fairly impressive compared to both mobile devices of the past, and also the fact that we are talking about what is essentially a pocket gadget, they cannot really compare with the specification of a top-of-the-range gaming PC or even a current generation console.<a class="indexterm" id="id8"/>
</p><p>This, of course, does not mean we can only develop poor or second rate games with UDK. Indeed, some of its contemporary examples highlight the huge potential it has in delivering AAA gaming experiences, even with its current limitations, borne, as described previously, from the hardware limitations of a mobile device.</p><p>The best example by far has got to be Chair Entertainment's and Epic Games'<span class="emphasis"><em> Infinity Blade</em></span>, an epic third-person sword-fighting game which came out in late 2010 and is considered the ideal showcase for UDK's technical prowess on the Apple devices.</p><p>Already spawning sequels and with huge commercial success behind it from its iTunes Store business model,<span class="emphasis"><em> Infinity Blade</em></span> was, and is, a big eye-opener for all aspiring games developers who want to use Unreal engine technology for a successful iOS title with a very modern feel and visuals.</p><p>To see just how powerful an iOS game can be, just look at the following screenshot for a fine example:<a class="indexterm" id="id9"/>

<a class="indexterm" id="id19"/>
</p><p>I would, however, strongly urge you to read this, particularly if you have aspirations towards becoming a professional UDK developer. You need to understand the agreement you are entering into for a number of reasons.
</p><p>In general, using UDK for educational use or for non-profit reasons for the most part is completely free, but if you intend to charge for your game or make revenue off of it for any reason, you will have to pay Epic $99 up front as well as a percentage of revenue after the game has made over $50,000.

<div class="section" title="Setting up for iOS development with UDK"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec04"/>Setting up for iOS development with UDK</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we get your iPhone interacting with UDK, here are a few brief notes you should be aware of. We've looked at installing UDK on our PC, but what about the mobile device requirements?<a class="indexterm" id="id41"/>
</p><p>While we will go into detail about deploying your game on the actual device with all the issues this entails in a subsequent step-by-step and illustrated chapter, there are still some very important initial topics that need clearing up in terms of becoming a UDK iOS developer.</p><p>First of all, the devices currently supported by Epic Games for UDK iOS games production, according to Epic Games, are the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iPhone 3GS</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iPhone 4/4S</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iPad</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iPad2</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iPod Touch third generation (other than for 8GB capacity third generation devices)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">iPod Touch fourth generation</li></ul></div><p>If you have an older iOS device, then unfortunately you won't be able to carry out UDK development for it. Also worth noting is that the iPad third generation currently works in UDK by using the iPad 2's system settings, and will most likely be fully supported with its own system settings by the time you have this book in your hands.</p><p>Additionally, you will need to be running iOS version 3.2 or higher on your device, plus iTunes installed on your PC in order to do UDK development. However, in order to publish your game to the iOS App Store, you will be required to use a Macintosh computer which we will be using in <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Publishing and Monetizing Your Game">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Publishing and Moneti zing Your Game</em></span>.</p><p>If you can adhere to all of the given requirements, then we can move on with our development of this and subsequent chapters.<a class="indexterm" id="id42"/>
</p><p>We will, however, come back to this area in the last couple of chapters to cover topics such as the Unreal Frontend and iOS provisioning which will be paramount in post-production to the game's deployment and its eventual distribution.</p><div class="section" title="Walkthrough of Unreal Remote"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Walkthrough of Unreal Remote</h2></div></div></div><p>So, with the practicalities out of the way, let's get our first taste of what it's like to develop for an iPhone with UDK!</p><p>The first foray we will be undertaking in this section and chapter will be a modest one indeed, but it is still a good showcase of the capabilities of iOS game development with the Unreal engine, particularly in terms of interacting with the player.</p><p>It uses two important concepts that we will be utilizing later on in this book; UDK Remote and the Mobile Previewer.</p><p>UDK Remote is an application designed by Epic Games to push, touch, and also tilt controls - essentially everything you need to control an iPhone or iPad game - from the mobile device onto your development machine (PC).<a class="indexterm" id="id43"/>
</p><p>The Mobile Previewer is an option that can be triggered inside the main UDK executable, which can be used to run the mobile UDK game on your PC. It is created for minor testing in much the same way that playing in the editor itself is an option in the main UDK executable. Think of the option as an emulator of what your game may look like on a specific mobile device. The option is not an entirely perfect one though, remember that the graphics processing unit on the PC will be more powerful than your iOS device's which could result in it being much faster in rendering content. Some visual effects results may be different too, for example, anti-aliasing. A good idea would be to very occasionally deploy the game on the mobile device just to make sure you are not exceeding its technical capabilities and also that everything looks the way it is supposed to. We will learn how to do this in a later chapter.<a class="indexterm" id="id44"/>
