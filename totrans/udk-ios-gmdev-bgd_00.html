With no signs of stopping, Apple's iOS devices are dominating the mobile scene and with UDK, the free version of the most popular third-party game engine available, it has never been easier to get into the app business.</p><p>This book,<span class="emphasis"><em> UDK iOS Game Development Beginner's Guide</em></span>, takes a clear, step-by-step approach to building a small third-person shooter game using the Unreal Development Kit with plenty of examples of how to create a game that is uniquely your own.</p><p>You will begin learning the fundamentals of the Unreal Engine before creating a third-person shooter game in UDK. After the game is created you will learn what can be done with any project to optimize your game for the iOS platform and discover special considerations that need to be made. Finally, you'll publish your game on the App Store for the world to see and play along, with details on the different costs associated with publishing.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
