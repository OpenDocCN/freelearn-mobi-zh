A scene in its most basic state is just a container pointing to all of all the art assets, scripts, behaviors, and so on. You can, of course, put all of your content into one big scene, but that is more suitable for very small games or those that stream all of their content from the Internet. With the constraints of most iOS devices and the speed of even 3G Internet connections it would be impractical to do that so we will focus on level-based design.
