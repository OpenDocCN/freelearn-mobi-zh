<span class="strong"><strong>Continuous integration</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CI</strong></span>)<a id="id292" class="indexterm"/> is a development practice that requires the developers in a team to integrate their work regularly, often multiple times per day. Every push to the main repository is verified by an automated build. This practice helps with detecting problems as soon as possible, thereby speeding up development, and increasing the quality of the code. The great Martin Fowler wrote an article about the subject that explains the concepts and describes the best <a id="id293" class="indexterm"/>practices (<a class="ulink" href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html</a>)</p><p>There are several options to set up CI for Android. The most widely used are <a id="id294" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Jenkins</strong></span>, <a id="id295" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>TeamCity</strong></span>, and <a id="id296" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Travis CI</strong></span>. Jenkins has the biggest ecosystem, with around a thousand available plugins. It is also an open source effort with a lot of contributors. TeamCity is a product from JetBrains, the company that also created IntelliJ IDEA. Travis CI is a relatively new player, and is mostly focused on open source projects.</p><p>We will look at these CI systems and how to make Gradle work on them. At the end of the chapter, we will mention some Gradle tricks to make CI easier, regardless of the chosen CI system.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Jenkins</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">TeamCity</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Travis CI</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Further automation</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Jenkins"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec41"/>Jenkins</h1></div></div></div><p>Jenkins<a id="id297" class="indexterm"/> was originally released as Hudson in 2005 by Sun Microsystems. Over the years, it grew to become the most popular CI system in the Java community. Shortly after Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle, there was a conflict between Oracle and the Java community regarding Hudson. When that could not be resolved, the community continued to work on the project under the name Jenkins because the name Hudson is owned by Oracle.</p><p>The power of Jenkins lies in its plugin system. Everyone who has a need for new functionality in the build system can create a new plugin that extends the capabilities of Jenkins. This is also why setting up an automated build for Android apps or libraries is quite straightforward.</p><div class="section" title="Setting up Jenkins"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec73"/>Setting up Jenkins</h2></div></div></div><p>If you do not<a id="id298" class="indexterm"/> already have Jenkins installed and running on your build machine, download it from the <a id="id299" class="indexterm"/>website (<a class="ulink" href="https://jenkins-ci.org">https://jenkins-ci.org</a>) and follow the steps.</p><p>Before you can get started with the actual Jenkins setup, you need to make sure you have all the required libraries for building Android apps and libraries. To build anything in Java, you need to <a id="id300" class="indexterm"/>download and install the JDK first, which can be downloaded from the Java website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>).</p><p>You also need to make sure you have the Android SDK and build tools installed. It is not necessary to install an IDE on your build server, unless you plan on opening the project on the build machine. If you just want to install the SDK tools, you can download those from the <a id="id301" class="indexterm"/>Android developer website (<a class="ulink" href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other">https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other</a>). Once you have downloaded and installed the package, you need to run the <code class="literal">android</code> executable in the SDK directory, so you can install the APIs and build tools you need.</p><p>Once Java and the Android SDK are installed, you need to configure these in Jenkins. Start by opening your web browser and navigating to Jenkins' home page on your build server. Go to <span class="strong"><strong>Manage Jenkins</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Configure System</strong></span> and scroll to <span class="strong"><strong>Global properties</strong></span>. Add two environment variables, <code class="literal">ANDROID_HOME</code> and <code class="literal">JAVA_HOME</code>, and set their values to the correct directories, as shown in this screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B01061_08_01.jpg" alt="Setting up Jenkins"/></div><p>You also <a id="id302" class="indexterm"/>need to install the Gradle plugin. Go to <span class="strong"><strong>Manage Jenkins</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Manage Plugins</strong></span>, navigate to the <span class="strong"><strong>Available</strong></span> tab, and search for <code class="literal">Gradle</code>. When you locate the Gradle plugin, simply check the box and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Download now and install after restart</strong></span>. This plugin makes it possible to create build steps that involve Gradle.</p></div><div class="section" title="Configuring the build"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec74"/>Configuring the build</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you have <a id="id303" class="indexterm"/>installed everything you need, you can create a CI project in Jenkins. The first thing you should do is to set up the VCS repository, so that Jenkins knows where to get the source code for your project. You can set up Jenkins to build your app or library automatically based on repository activity, using build triggers, or you can choose to only do manual builds. To perform the actual build, you need to add a new build step that invokes a Gradle script. You can configure Jenkins to use the Gradle Wrapper, which is present by default in Android projects. Using the Gradle Wrapper not only eliminates the need for manually installing Gradle on your build server, it also makes sure that any updates of Gradle are handled automatically. It is a good idea to also check the <span class="strong"><strong>Make gradlew executable</strong></span> box. This solves an issue with permission for executing the Gradle Wrapper, when the project is created on a Microsoft Windows machine.</p><p>You can enter a nice description for the build step, and optionally add two switches <code class="literal">info</code> and <code class="literal">stacktrace</code>. The <code class="literal">info</code> switch is used to print out more information of the build process, which can be useful in case something goes wrong. If the build causes an exception, the <code class="literal">stacktrace</code> switch prints out the stack trace of this exception. Sometimes you might need more detailed information, in which case you can use the <code class="literal">full-stacktrace</code> switch instead.</p><p>To finalize the <a id="id304" class="indexterm"/>configuration, specify the Gradle tasks you want to execute. First, execute the <code class="literal">clean</code> task, to make sure there is no output left from any previous builds. Second, execute the <code class="literal">build</code> task, which triggers a build of all variants. The Jenkins configuration should look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B01061_08_02.jpg" alt="Configuring the build"/></div><p>Once you have saved the<a id="id305" class="indexterm"/> project configuration, you can run the build.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note25"/>Note</h3><p>If your build server is installed on a 64-bit Linux machine, you might run into this exception <code class="literal">java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "aapt": error=2, No such file or directory</code>. This is because AAPT is a 32 bit application and needs some extra libraries in order to run on a 64 bit machine. To install the necessary libraries, use this command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6 lib32z1</strong></span>
</pre></div></div></div><p>If the build finishes <a id="id306" class="indexterm"/>without any issues, it creates APKs for all your build variants. You can use specific Gradle tasks to distribute these APKs. We will mention automatic distribution at the end of the chapter, as it is not specific to any build system.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B01061_08_03.jpg" alt="Configuring the build"/></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="TeamCity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec42"/>TeamCity</h1></div></div></div><p>Unlike Jenkins, TeamCity <a id="id307" class="indexterm"/>is a proprietary product that is free to use only for open source projects. It is created and managed by JetBrains. This is the same company that also created IntelliJ IDEA, which is the IDE that Android Studio is based on. TeamCity supports Android builds with Gradle out of the box.</p><div class="section" title="Setting up TeamCity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec75"/>Setting up TeamCity</h2></div></div></div><p>If you do not have a<a id="id308" class="indexterm"/> running TeamCity installation yet, download it from the JetBrains<a id="id309" class="indexterm"/> website (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity">https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity</a>) and follow the steps.</p><p>To get started with building Android apps and libraries with TeamCity, you need to make sure the JDK, the Android SDK, and the Android build tools are installed on your build server. You can find the instructions for this in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Jenkins</em></span> section. You also need to add <code class="literal">ANDROID_HOME</code> to the environment variables of the machine, and point it to the Android SDK directory.</p><p>Unlike Jenkins, TeamCity does not require any plugins to trigger Gradle builds, as TeamCity has built-in support for running Gradle.</p></div><div class="section" title="Configuring the build"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec76"/>Configuring the build</h2></div></div></div><p>To set up an Android <a id="id310" class="indexterm"/>build, you start by creating a new project. All you need to provide is a name. Once the project is created, you can start configuring it. First, you need to add a VCS root so that TeamCity can find the source code for your project. Then you need to create a new build configuration. You also need to attach the VCS root to the build configuration. When that is set up, you can add a new build step. If you press the <span class="strong"><strong>Auto-detect build steps</strong></span> button, TeamCity will try to determine the necessary build steps, based on the content of the project. In case of a Gradle-based Android project, the result looks like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B01061_08_04.jpg" alt="Configuring the build"/></div><p>TeamCity detects<a id="id311" class="indexterm"/> that the project uses Gradle, and even that the Gradle wrapper is present. You can just select the Gradle build step, and add it to the build configuration. If you do not need to do anything advanced, this is enough to make sure your Android app gets built. You can test the configuration by opening the project overview and clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Run…</strong></span> button for the Android project.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Travis CI"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec43"/>Travis CI</h1></div></div></div><p>If your <a id="id312" class="indexterm"/>project's repository is hosted on GitHub, you can use Travis CI for your automated builds. Travis CI (<a class="ulink" href="https://travis-ci.org">https://travis-ci.org</a>) is<a id="id313" class="indexterm"/> an open source hosted continuous integration system, and is free to use for public repositories. There is a paid plan for private repositories, but in this book we will only look at the free option.</p><p>Travis detects when a new commit is pushed to the repository and starts a new build automatically. By default, Travis builds all branches, not just the master branch. It also builds pull requests automatically; a useful feature for open source projects.</p><p>Because of how Travis works internally, you cannot configure the build server itself. Instead, you need to create a configuration file that contains all the information that Travis needs to build your app or library.</p><div class="section" title="Configuring the build"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec77"/>Configuring the build</h2></div></div></div><p>If you want to enable <a id="id314" class="indexterm"/>Travis builds for your project, you first need to log in to Travis CI and connect your account to GitHub. Once that is done, you need to enable the project you want to build in the settings.</p><p>In order to configure the build process, Travis requires you to create a file called <code class="literal">.travis.yml</code> that contains the entire setup. To configure an Android project, you need to define the language and add a few Android-specific properties:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">language: android
android:
  components:
    # The build tools version used by your project
    - build-tools-22.0.1

    # The SDK version used to compile your project
    - android-22

    # Additional components
    - extra-android-m2repository</pre></div><p>The language setting specifies which kind of build process you want to run. In this case, you are building an Android app. The Android-specific properties include the version of the build tools and the Android SDK version that need to be used. Travis will download those prior to running the <code class="literal">build</code> tasks. If you make use of the support library or Google Play Services, you need to specify that explicitly because Travis needs to download the repositories for those dependencies as well.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note26"/>Note</h3><p>It is not mandatory to configure the build tools and SDK version, but you will encounter fewer issues if you make sure the version aligns with what you have specified in the <code class="literal">build.gradle</code> file.</p></div></div><p>If you create an Android project on Microsoft Windows, the Gradle Wrapper file is known to have issues with permissions. Therefore, it is a good idea to fix the permission before running the actual build script. You can add a prebuild step like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">before_script:
  # Change Gradle wrapper permissions
  - chmod +x gradlew</pre></div><p>To start the build itself, add this line to the Travis configuration file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"># Let's build
script: ./gradlew clean build</pre></div><p>This command will run the Gradle Wrapper, just like you would on a developer machine, and execute the <code class="literal">clean</code> and <code class="literal">build</code> tasks.</p><p>When you are done <a id="id315" class="indexterm"/>configuring the Travis build, you can commit and push the file to the project's GitHub repository. If everything is set up correctly, Travis will start the build process, which you can follow on the Travis website. This is what it looks like when a project is successfully built:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B01061_08_05.jpg" alt="Configuring the build"/></div><p>Travis also sends an <a id="id316" class="indexterm"/>e-mail report after every build. This can be especially useful if you are the maintainer of an open source library that regularly gets pull requests. The report e-mail from Travis looks like this when a build is successful:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B01061_08_06.jpg" alt="Configuring the build"/></div><p>You will quickly <a id="id317" class="indexterm"/>notice that Travis has a big downside, and that is speed. Travis does not give you one specific machine, but boots up a vanilla virtual machine for every build you trigger. This means for every new build, Travis has to download and install the Android SDK and build tools, before it can start building your app or library.</p><p>On the upside, Travis is free and public, which makes it perfect for open source projects. Travis also builds pull requests automatically, which can give you peace of mind when someone submits a patch to your code.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Further automation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec44"/>Further automation</h1></div></div></div><p>Most modern continuous<a id="id318" class="indexterm"/> integration systems support Gradle, either by default or through a plugin. This means that instead of just building your app or library, you can create all kinds of Gradle tasks to further automate the build. The advantage of defining extra build steps with Gradle tasks, instead of in the CI system itself is that the extra build steps become much more portable. It is easy to run a custom Gradle task on your development machine. A custom Jenkins build step, on the other hand, is impossible to run without having Jenkins installed. Having extra build steps in a certain CI system also makes it harder to switch to a different CI system. Gradle tasks can also easily be ported to different projects. In this section, we will look at a few ways to further automate building and deploying apps and libraries, using Gradle tasks and plugins.</p><div class="section" title="The SDK manager plugin"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec78"/>The SDK manager plugin</h2></div></div></div><p>An issue you<a id="id319" class="indexterm"/> might run into at<a id="id320" class="indexterm"/> some point is that the Android SDK on the build server is not up to date. When you update the SDK version for your app or library, you also need to install the new SDK on the build server. If you have multiple build agents, this becomes a real hassle.</p><p>Thanks to community efforts, there is a Gradle plugin that takes care of checking whether the build depends on an Android SDK version that is not present. If the SDK is not present, the plugin will download it automatically.</p><p>The SDK manager plugin will download not only the compilation SDK specified in the build configuration file, but also the correct version of the build tools and platform tools. If your project has a dependency on the support library or Google Play Services, the plugin will download the specified version of those as well.</p><p>The SDK manager <a id="id321" class="indexterm"/>plugin is an open source plugin, you can find the source code for it on GitHub (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin">https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin</a>).</p></div><div class="section" title="Running tests"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec79"/>Running tests</h2></div></div></div><p>If you want to run <a id="id322" class="indexterm"/>unit tests (JUnit or Robolectric) during the build process on the build server, you simply need to add the corresponding tasks to the Gradle execution. If you want to run any functional tests, you will need an emulator to install your app on, so you can run the tests with <code class="literal">gradlew connectedAndroidTest</code>.</p><p>The simplest option for running an emulator is to just launch an emulator on the build server, and keep it open all the time. Unfortunately, this is not an optimal solution, because the Android emulators are quite prone to random crashes, especially when you keep them open for multiple days.</p><p>If you are using Jenkins, there is a plugin called<a id="id323" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Android Emulator Plugin</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Android+Emulator+Plugin">https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Android+Emulator+Plugin</a>) that can be configured to launch an emulator for every build of your app or library. TeamCity also has a lively plugin ecosystem, and there is a plugin called <a id="id324" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Android Emulator</strong></span> that helps setting up an emulator in the same way as the Jenkins plugin. You can find it, along with other TeamCity plugins, on the official TeamCity plugins page<a id="id325" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TW/TeamCity+Plugins">https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TW/TeamCity+Plugins</a>).</p><p>Travis CI has the ability to start an emulator, but this is an experimental functionality. If you want to try it anyway, add this snippet to your <code class="literal">.travis.yml</code> configuration file to launch an Android emulator during your Travis builds:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"># Emulator Management: Create, Start and Wait
before_script:
  - echo no | android create avd --force -n test -t android-22 --abi armeabi-v7a
  - emulator -avd test -no-skin -no-audio -no-window &amp;
  - android-wait-for-emulator
  - adb shell input keyevent 82 &amp;</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">android-wait-for-emulator</code> instruction tells Travis to wait for the emulator to start. When the<a id="id326" class="indexterm"/> emulator is booted, <code class="literal">adb shell input keyevent 82 &amp;</code> is executed to unlock the screen. After that, you can just tell Gradle to run the tests.</p></div><div class="section" title="Continuous deployment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec80"/>Continuous deployment</h2></div></div></div><p>To help developers <a id="id327" class="indexterm"/>with automatic deployment of Android apps, Google released the Google Play Developer API, an API for pushing APKs to Google Play programmatically (<a class="ulink" href="https://developers.google.com/android-publisher">https://developers.google.com/android-publisher</a>). This API removes the need for you to open a browser, log in to Google Play, and upload APKs using the web interface. Instead of creating your own publishing script based on the Google Play Developer API, you can use one of the many plugins to push APKs to Google Play directly after a successful build, straight from the build system.</p><p>There is a Jenkins plugin called<a id="id328" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Google Play Android Publisher</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+Play+Android+Publisher+Plugin">https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+Play+Android+Publisher+Plugin</a>) that can handle this for you. A better option, though, is to use a Gradle plugin, so that you can execute the publishing task from any device and any kind of continuous integration system. Some people in the Android community created a Gradle plugin built around the Google Play Developer API that enables you to configure the entire publishing process. You can find the Gradle Play Publisher Gradle plugin<a id="id329" class="indexterm"/> source code on GitHub (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher">https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher</a>). It is also available through Maven Central or<a id="id330" class="indexterm"/> JCenter.</p><p>To start using this plugin, add this to your main <code class="literal">build.gradle</code> file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.triplet.gradle:play-publisher:1.0.4'
    }
}</pre></div><p>Then apply the plugin in your Android module's <code class="literal">build.gradle</code> file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">apply plugin: 'play'</pre></div><p>When you apply the Gradle Play Publisher plugin to your build, you will have a few new tasks to your availability:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">publishApkRelease</code> uploads the APK and the recent changes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">publishListingRelease</code> uploads the descriptions and images</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">publishRelease</code> uploads everything</li></ul></div><p>If you have different build variants, you can also execute a variant-specific version of these tasks, for example, <code class="literal">publishApkFreeRelease</code> and <code class="literal">publishApkPaidRelease</code>.</p><p>To get access to the Google Play Developer API, you need to set up a service account. This setup is out of the scope of this book, but it is required if you want to use the Gradle Play Publisher plugin. To get started, follow the steps in the documentation for the Google Play Developer API<a id="id331" class="indexterm"/> at <a class="ulink" href="https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started">https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started</a>.</p><p>Once you have created a service account, you can enter the credentials in your build configuration file like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">play {
    serviceAccountEmail = 'serviceaccount'
    pk12File = file('key.p12')
}</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">play</code> block is for properties that are specific for the Gradle Play Publisher plugin. In addition to the service account credentials, you can also specify the track the APK should push to:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">play {
    track = 'production'
}</pre></div><p>The default track <a id="id332" class="indexterm"/>is <code class="literal">alpha</code>, but you can change it to <code class="literal">beta</code> or <code class="literal">production</code> instead.</p></div><div class="section" title="Beta distribution"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec81"/>Beta distribution</h2></div></div></div><p>There are a lot of<a id="id333" class="indexterm"/> options for beta testing of Android apps, such as the beta track on the Google Play store itself. Another option is<a id="id334" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Crashlytics</strong></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://crashlytics.com">https://crashlytics.com</a>), which<a id="id335" class="indexterm"/> has a very nice integration with Gradle. The team at Crashlytics created a custom plugin that not only creates new Gradle tasks to publish builds to their platform, but also hooks into the Android plugin's tasks to handle ProGuard mapping.</p><p>To get started with Crashlytics, follow the steps on their website. Once you have set it up, it will start hooking into your builds. The Crashlytics plugin exposes a new task called <code class="literal">crashlyticsUploadDistributionInternal</code> that can be used to upload APKs to Crashlytics. To push a new version of your app, you first need to build it using the <code class="literal">build</code> or <code class="literal">assemble</code> tasks. Once the APK is ready, you can upload it to Crashlytics using the <code class="literal">crashlyticsUploadDistributionInternal</code> task. The Crashlytics plugin creates an upload task for every build variant in your project.</p><p>Thanks to the custom Gradle plugin, it is very easy for developers to get started with Crashlytics. It also makes it a breeze to upload your test builds to Crashlytics, because you just need to execute one extra task during the build process. This is a great example of how powerful the proper use of Gradle can be, and how a good Gradle plugin can make developers' lives a lot easier.</p></div></div>
