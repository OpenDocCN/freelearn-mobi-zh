- en: When directly comparing Arduino and Android, one can see that they are two incredibly
    different platforms with different targets. Arduino is mostly focused on connecting
    physical everyday objects to embedded microcontrollers. On the other hand, Android
    intends to provide the necessary operating system and framework to operate countless
    smartphones around the world.

- en: This reality also reflects the contrasting realities of the authors, who come
    from very different backgrounds and cultures; Stefan hails from the Island of
    Malta, and he brings with him a medical background and passion for the intersection
    of technology and medicine, whereas Marco originates from France and has an electrical
    engineering background.

- en: The power of combining the efforts of Arduino and Android platforms bring about
    incredibly implemented practical projects that enhance daily life. Keeping this
    motivation in mind is what brought two authors from contrasting backgrounds together
    to work on this book. We believe in the intersection of technology and real life
    and visualize a future where technology will keep on forming an integral part
    of our day-to-day life.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Setting Up Your Workspace"), *Setting Up
    Your Workspace*, covers the necessary steps that you will have to take in order
    to build all the projects of the book. You will learn how to set up the Android
    development environment. We will also build our first Arduino project.'

    *Controlling an Arduino Board via Bluetooth*, teaches us how to link Arduino and
    Android for the first time. We will build an Arduino system with a Bluetooth Low
    Energy module, and control a simple LED from an Android application.'
