<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec03"/>Time for action — enabling ads</h1></div></div></div><p>With an active iAd Contract with Apple we're able to begin serving live iAd campaigns on a per-app basis. To enable ads, follow the ensuing steps:<a class="indexterm" id="id411"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Log in to iTunes Connect using your Apple ID. Select<strong> Manage Your Applications</strong>. Find and open the application you'd like to enable ads for.</li><li class="listitem">From the right-hand menu, select<strong> Set Up iAd Network</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="Time for action — enabling ads" src="img/1321_11_02.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Select whether your primary audience is for under 17 year olds.

This means you risk test advertisements being delivered in your live app, which by their very nature don't generate any revenue! Once enabled, the only way to stop the delivery of ads to your application is to submit an app update without any banner views. You can't remove your app from the iAd Network from iTunes Connect.</p><p>Apple limits live banners from appearing in your development apps to prevent falsely earning revenue while testing your app, and to stop taps being exploited with<strong> click fraud</strong>. Click fraud is when taps or clicks are artificially generated to falsely increase revenue from the iAd Network.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec04"/>Monitoring your income</h1></div></div></div><p>Similar to tracking your own iAd campaign, displaying and monitoring the ads in your app requires you to understand the metrics and terminology. The key terms used that we'll be looking at when monitoring income are:<a class="indexterm" id="id413"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Revenue</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Impressions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Requests</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Fill-rate</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">eCPM</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Click-through rate</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec05"/>Revenue</h2></div></div></div><p>This is the key metric—how much money your apps are making! Apple splits their earnings from ads 60/40 in your favor; so for every $100 they generate, you'll receive $60 of it. The revenue shown is your actual take home earnings. Revenue is calculated from a mixture of impressions and clicks the banners in your app receive.<a class="indexterm" id="id414"/>
</p><p>Apple transfers your generated income to you by check or bank transfer once your accumulated revenue reaches a certain threshold.<a class="indexterm" id="id415"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec06"/>Impressions</h2></div></div></div><p>An<strong> impression</strong> is when a banner is loaded and appears in your application. Therefore, the impressions shown are the total amount of banners that have appeared in your app for a given time period.<a class="indexterm" id="id416"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec07"/>Requests</h2></div></div></div><p>Each time your app requests a new banner from the iAd Network to display within your app, this is logged by Apple as a<strong> request</strong>. Each use of your app by a user will typically result in many requests, as the banners in your app will only be displayed for a set period of time before being cycled with fresh content.<a class="indexterm" id="id417"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec08"/>Fill-rate</h2></div></div></div><p>The<strong> fill-rate</strong> is the percentage of requests sent from your app that are successfully filled and return an ad for display. The higher the fill-rate, the better because it means your app is displaying as many ads as possible. A low fill-rate can occur when your app is used heavily in markets that are not yet in the iAd Network.<a class="indexterm" id="id418"/>
</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note143"/>Note</h3><p>To find out the countries and territories currently served by the iAd Network, visit<a class="ulink" href="http://developer.apple.com/iad/">http://developer.apple.com/iad/</a>.</p></div><p>If your fill-rate is zero percent, consider contacting Apple; occasionally they can disable ad delivery if they have concerns about the content of your app or don't have any advertisers currently offering ads for your app's genre.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec09"/>eCPM</h2></div></div></div><p>eCPM, or effective cost per mille (thousand), is your revenue divided by how many thousand impressions of banners your app shows. It allows you to extrapolate your earnings if the usage of your app, therefore the impressions, were to increase.<a class="indexterm" id="id419"/>
</p><p>If your combined revenue from impressions and clicks is at $2000, and your app's banner impressions are 100 thousand, then your eCPM would be $20. This means for every 1000 impressions, your average earnings would be $20. You can then estimate your earnings; say your app receives 200 thousand impressions, then you'd likely earn 200 multiplied by $20, or $4000.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec10"/>Click-through rate</h2></div></div></div><p>The<strong> click-through rate</strong> is the percentage of banner views that result in the user clicking, or tapping it to reveal the core ad unit. Clicks generate more revenue than simple impressions, so having a high click-through rate is ideal. If your click through rate is low, it could be due to the positioning of your banner not being easily accessible to users of your app. Make sure your banner view is added and visible throughout your app, either at the top or the bottom of the screen.<a class="indexterm" id="id420"/>
</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec05"/>Time for action — analysing earnings</h1></div></div></div><p>The iAd Network provides a rich visual interface with data and graphs for you to track your app's earnings. You'll need an active app that is live on the store and generating revenue to continue.<a class="indexterm" id="id421"/>
