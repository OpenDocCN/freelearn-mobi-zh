Swift is a very modern and powerful language. In the last year, Swift has become a very popular programming language. It has evolved and changed. Since Swift is fairly new, there are many questions related to its performance characteristics and best practice for achieving high performance in it.</p><p class="calibre8">
<em class="calibre10">Swift High Performance</em> provides an overview of the important features of Swift, its performance characteristics, and sets of advices and techniques that allow you to build solid and sustainable applications in Swift with great performance.</p><p class="calibre8">This book also provides an overview of different tools that help you debug, investigate, and improve your code.</p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div>
