- en: In this final part, you will learn to create a video streaming app called Packtflix.
    You will start by setting up the appâ€™s structure, implementing secure user authentication
    using OAuth2, and building dynamic UI components with Jetpack Compose to browse
    movie lists and details. Then, you will master video playback by integrating ExoPlayer,
    creating an intuitive playback UI, managing media controls, and adding subtitles
    for accessibility. Finally, you will enhance the app with extended video playback
    functionalities, including **Picture-in-Picture** (**PiP**) mode and media casting,
    enabling seamless multitasking and streaming to larger screens.
