            <p>Throughout this book we've come a long way, from learning about Xcode to how to build
               an entire app. This process would not be complete, however, without actually learning
               how to submit the app to the App Store. This process may seem like a lot when doing
               it for the first time, but it becomes easier and even second nature after a while.
            </p>
            
            <p>When I submitted my first app, I was extremely nervous. I remember the relief I felt
               after submitting the app, but I was soon repeatedly checking the site and my inbox
               for that approval email. I'd heard many stories of people who spent a lot of time
               working on an app only to have it rejected; these fears are understandable, but know
               that Apple wants you to succeed. Even if your app gets rejected (and my first one
               did), it's not necessarily a bad thing.
            </p>
            
            <p>My first app was a sports app, and it was rejected for two reasons. First, in Apple's
               eyes, the logo for my app was too similar to the NFL logo. To address this, I simply
               made a generic logo with the initials of the app. Second, the quality of my images
               was considered not up to standard; therefore, I obtained better images. I then resubmitted
               my app, and within a couple of days my app was approved. It is almost a certainty
               that you will encounter rejections, even if you have been doing this for a while.
               Take comfort in the fact that you can address any issues with your app and resubmit
               it for approval from the App Store.
            </p>
            
            <p>In this chapter, we will cover everything you need to know about getting your app
               into the App Store. In Xcode 9, a lot of things are done for you behind the scenes;
               however, the goal of this chapter is to show you how you can set up things on your
               own. You will need a developer account in order to follow along with these steps.
               Go to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">https://developer.apple.com/programs/</a> if you would like to purchase a developer account.
            </p>
            
            <p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Creating a bundle identifier</li>
               
               <li>Creating a certificate signing request</li>
               
               <li>Creating production and development certificates</li>
               
               <li>Creating production and development provisioning profiles</li>
               
               <li>Creating an App Store listing</li>
               
               <li>Making the release build and submitting to the App Store</li>
               
               <li>Conducting internal and external testing</li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>This chapter is set up for you to use as you need it. It is not meant for you to follow
               in order, as with the other chapters in this book. For example, you may need to create
               a bundle identifier and then need to know how to add external testers. Use this chapter
               as a resource for when you need to do one of these tasks.

            <p>When we created our project, we talked about the bundle identifier (also known as
               your App ID). This bundle identifier is used to identify your app, and therefore must
               be unique. Let's proceed with the following steps:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>Log in to your Apple developer account, and you will see the following screen:</li>

            <p>Whenever you work on a project, you will need to create a <strong>certificate signing request</strong> (<strong>CSR</strong>). You create this certificate on your computer and then upload it into the Apple
               developer account. You then download this file and open it into <strong>Keychain Access</strong> when you're done. Let's create one certificate for production (for the App Store)
               and one certificate for development (for building locally):
            </p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>Open Keychain Access (which you can find by clicking on the search icon in the upper-right
                  corner of your menu bar and typing <kbd>Keychain Access</kbd>):

            <p>We need to create production and development certificates. Production certificates
               are used for the App Store, while development certificates are used to verify that
               you are a team member who allows apps signed by you to launch on a device. Remember
               that Xcode 9 can now handle this for you, but knowing the process is still useful.
               Let's start by creating a production certificate first:

            <p>Now let's create a production provisioning profile, which is used for distributing
               your application. Xcode 9 creates these for you, but, again, it is still good to know

            <p>When you submit your app to the App Store, you need to create an archive. This archive
               will also be used for internal and external testing, which we will address shortly.
               When your archive is complete, you will upload it to the App Store. Let's create an
               archive now:

This is all based on your business and how you want to handle <span class="packt_screen">Version numbers</span>.

            <p>Internal and external testing use what is known as <strong>TestFlight</strong>. The <em>TestFlight</em> app can be downloaded from the App Store. Email addresses are required to sign people
               up to <em>TestFlight</em>. Let's look at how to create each type of testing.

            <p>You have now completed the entire process of building an app and submitting it to
               the App Store. If you have gone from beginning to end, congratulate yourself, because
               it is truly a big feat.
            </p>
            
            <p>At this point, all you can do is wait for Apple to review your project. The next week
               or so will be the most nerve-wracking (at least it was for me). Don't worry if your
               app gets rejected, because it happens to the most experienced of developers and is
               often fixable. Apps can be rejected for minor reasons that are easy to fix; however,
               you do not want to work for months on a project and miss something big that Apple
               will never approve. So, do your research as to what is and is not acceptable to Apple.
               When you submit your apps to the App Store, please reach out to me on Twitter (<kbd>@thedevme</kbd>) to let me know—I would love to see what you have built.
