- en: We still believed in the original vision, and it's possible that persevering
    and keeping this going out there in the wild may have yielded something. However,
    we were invalidated conclusively and decided to pivot away and explore other ideas.
    In hindsight, it was a good decision and likely saved us from the clutches of
    the sunken cost fallacy.

    The example we saw in this chapter involved a non-refundable sporting event ticket.
    Many people would feel obliged to go to the event despite not really wanting to,
    because doing otherwise would be wasting the ticket price; they feel they've passed
    the point of no return.
