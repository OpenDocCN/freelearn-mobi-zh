</p><div class="section" title="Launch screen"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec02"/>Launch screen</h2></div></div></div><p>When you first open iAd Producer, you'll be able to start a new iPhone or iPad project from the project selector, as shown in the following screenshot. As the screen size and experience is so different between the two devices, we have to design and build ads specifically for each one:<a class="indexterm" id="id90"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Launch screen" src="graphics/1321_03_02.jpg"/></div><p>From the launch screen, you can also open existing projects you've been working on.<a class="indexterm" id="id91"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Default ad"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec03"/>Default ad</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you have chosen to create either an iPad or iPhone iAd, a placeholder ad is created for you, showing the visual flow. This is the overview of your ad, which you'll be using to piece the sections of your ad together. The following screenshot shows the default overview:<a class="indexterm" id="id92"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Default ad" src="graphics/1321_03_03.jpg"/></div><p>Double-clicking on any of the screens in your ad flow will ask you to pick a template for that page; once assigned, you're then able to design the iAd using the canvas editor.<a class="indexterm" id="id93"/>
</p></div><div class="section" title="Template selector"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec04"/>Template selector</h2></div></div></div><p>Before we edit any page of an ad, we have to apply a template to it, even if it's just a blank canvas to build upon. iAd Producer automatically shows the relevant templates to the current page you're editing. This means your ad follows a structure that the users expect. Templates provide some great starting points for your iAd, whether it's for a simple banner with an image and text or a 3D image carousel that the user can flick and manipulate, all created with easy point and click. The following screenshot is an example of the template chooser:<a class="indexterm" id="id94"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Template selector" src="graphics/1321_03_04.jpg"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Asset Library"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec05"/>Asset Library</h2></div></div></div><p>The Asset Library holds all the media and content for your iAd, such as the images, videos, and audio. When adding media to your<span class="strong"><strong> Asset Library</strong></span>, make sure you're using high-resolution images for the high-resolution Retina display. iAd Producer automatically generates the lower-resolution images for your ad, whenever you import resources.<a class="indexterm" id="id95"/>
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note29"/>Note</h3><p>If you wanted an image to be 200px wide and 300px high, you should double the horizontal and vertical pixels to 400px wide and 600px high.

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">If you're continuing on from the last exercise, click on the<span class="strong"><strong> Overview</strong></span> back button in the top-left of iAd Producer. If you aren't, then open iAd Producer and choose<span class="strong"><strong> Open Project</strong></span>; find the<code class="literal"> Dino Stores</code> project we've been using so far.</li><li class="listitem">You should now see the overview of your iAd and the flow between each component. Double-click the<span class="strong"><strong> Splash</strong></span> page to open the template selector. For this splash page, we'll be using the<span class="strong"><strong> Bouncing Logo</strong></span> template. Double-click the page again to open it on the canvas.</li><li class="listitem">Open the<span class="strong"><strong> Asset Library</strong></span> pane from the<span class="strong"><strong> Assets</strong></span> option, on the right of the bottom bar. This should show all the assets we imported earlier. Drag<span class="strong"><strong> Pterodactyl.png</strong></span> to the large image placeholder box on our splash's canvas.</li><li class="listitem">You may have noticed our pterodactyl's wings and head have got cut off. We can fix this by resizing the image box using the drag handles. Once you've changed the size of the image box to show the entire image, make sure it is still centered by dragging the entire image, so that a yellow line appears down the middle of the canvas and the image snaps to it. This is iAd Producer suggesting the ideal position for it. The following screenshot is an example of the yellowlined, suggested positioning in iAd Producer:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — making the splash screen" src="graphics/1321_03_13.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">We've added the image into our splash; now, we'll customize the text. The<span class="strong"><strong> Bouncing Logo</strong></span> template comes with a<code class="literal"> Multi-Label</code> object, similar to a standard label, but it let's us change between different messages with a transition.<a class="indexterm" id="id117"/></li><li class="listitem">Double-click on the<span class="strong"><strong> multi-label</strong></span>; at the moment, it should say<span class="strong"><strong> Loading Message 1</strong></span>.

In the following screenshot, this cell navigation arrow is highlighted:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — making the splash screen" src="graphics/1321_03_14.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now, enter the text for the second cell, say<code class="literal"> but finally..</code>. Move on to the third cell and add the final message, for example,<code class="literal"> they're here</code>.</li><li class="listitem">iAd Producer will now automatically transition between these cells, while our ad is loading. To ensure our message gets a chance to complete a full cycle, we need to adjust the timing of the multi-label. We'll change the time each cell is visible for and the length of the transition, and make sure the splash is visible for a certain time.</li><li class="listitem">To change the multi-label duration, click anywhere outside of the cell to exit the editing mode. Now single-click back on the multi-label to select it, but don't enter back into the editing mode. If the inspector pane isn't visible, open it up and find the<span class="strong"><strong> Effects</strong></span> section. We'll want to change the<span class="strong"><strong> By Letter</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> Line</strong></span>. This means the effect is applied to an entire line at a time, instead of each individual letter. Check that the<span class="strong"><strong> Show For</strong></span> is<span class="strong"><strong> 2s</strong></span> and the<span class="strong"><strong> Hide For</strong></span> is<span class="strong"><strong> 0.5s</strong></span>; change these if they're not. Your final effects should look like the following screenshot:<a class="indexterm" id="id118"/><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — making the splash screen" src="graphics/1321_03_15.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now let's change the minimum duration of the splash to<span class="strong"><strong> 7.5s</strong></span>. Click the background of the iAd to modify the main splash properties. In the inspector pane, change the<span class="strong"><strong> Show Page for at Least</strong></span> value to<span class="strong"><strong> 7.5s</strong></span>, by dragging the slider to the right.<a class="indexterm" id="id119"/><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note38"/>Note</h3><p>We chose a minimum duration of<span class="strong"><strong> 7.5s</strong></span> , as this allows the entire effect animation on the multi-label cell to complete. Each cell is visible for 2 seconds and hidden for 0.5 seconds, making a total of 2.5 seconds. Then we have three cells in total, making a total duration of 3 x 2.5 seconds, or 7.5 seconds. It's important to keep the splash screen visible for as little time as possible, to prevent the user from closing your ad before they even reach the content!</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Finally, we'll add a background gradient to our splash. Under the<span class="strong"><strong> Show Page for at Least</strong></span>, find the<span class="strong"><strong> Background</strong></span> section. Just as we did with the background of our banner, we'll use a radial gradient. We're going to click on the first color on the gradient strip and select<span class="emphasis"><em> Snow</em></span>, the white crayon on the bottom right. Now click the second color box on the gradient strip and choose<span class="emphasis"><em> Cantaloupe</em></span> from the bottom left.</li><li class="listitem">Save your project from the<span class="strong"><strong> File</strong></span> menu. That's our final splash, and it'll look similar to the following screenshot:<a class="indexterm" id="id120"/><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — making the splash screen" src="graphics/1321_03_16.jpg"/></div></li></ol></div><div class="section" title="What just happened?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec15"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>We've now made our first splash screen, transitioning the user into the core ad unit. You modified the animation effect timings to ensure the full splash animation gets viewed by the user.</p><p>As our splash page includes animations that can't be previewed in iAd Producer, let's take a quick look at how to simulate them using Safari.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Previewing the ad"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec14"/>Previewing the ad</h1></div></div></div><p>Whilst iAd Producer gives a great overview of the positions, styling, and flow of your iAd, it doesn't show us animations or let us interact with our ad. Fortunately, as each iAd is built using the latest web technologies, we're able to use<span class="strong"><strong> Safari</strong></span>, the built-in web browser on your Mac. Safari uses the same engine to display web pages as the iPhone, so the representation should be accurate; however, remember your Mac is a lot faster than your iPhone, so performance may be worse on that device.<a class="indexterm" id="id121"/>

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">If it isn't open already, open the<code class="literal"> Dino Stores</code> project that we've been working on and open up the banner on the canvas editor. You might need to return to the overview to find the banner.</li><li class="listitem">From the menu bar, select<span class="strong"><strong> Export</strong></span> then<span class="strong"><strong> Preview in Safari</strong></span>. This will open Safari, with your banner in it. You should see the text slide in from the right and the image fade up. Don't worry if you can see the text before it enters the main banner area, which would be out of the visible frame on the iPhone.<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note39"/>Note</h3><p>You might have noticed that the iAd logo and frame is missing from the preview in Safari, this is added by the iAd system on the iOS devices and is not available in Safari.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Let's view the animation again by refreshing the page. From the menu bar in Safari, choose<span class="strong"><strong> View</strong></span> and then<span class="strong"><strong> Reload page</strong></span>.

</p><p>Now that we've seen how our banner and splash page are going to look, let's continue building the rest of our ad.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Adding a menu"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec16"/>Adding a menu</h1></div></div></div><p>The menu is the root view of our core ad unit and is used as the primary navigation between the subviews of our iAd.

<div class="section" title="Time for action &#x2014; making a menu"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec17"/>Time for action — making a menu</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's make a menu for our iAd that will allow access to the three pages in our ad—an image gallery, a shakeable image view, and a store finder. To make the menu, follow the ensuing steps:<a class="indexterm" id="id125"/>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">If you haven't done so already, open up iAd Producer and the<code class="literal"> Dino Stores</code> project we've been working on. From the overview screen, double-click the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> page in the app. Then, flow to open the template chooser.</li><li class="listitem">For this menu, we'll use the<code class="literal"> Hide-Reveal</code> template, which gives us a menu that slides out to the bottom when we change pages and that can slide back in when the user wants to get back to the main menu. Select this template and click<span class="strong"><strong> choose</strong></span>. Double-click the<span class="strong"><strong> Hide-Reveal</strong></span> menu in the ad flow to open up the menu canvas.</li><li class="listitem">Double-click the menu area to open its editing mode. Then, double-click on<span class="strong"><strong> Page 1</strong></span> to change the text. The first page of our ad will be the image gallery, so enter some text, say<span class="strong"><strong> View our pets</strong></span>. Repeat this for the next two items, the shakable image view and the store finder. You could use<span class="strong"><strong> All shapes and sizes</strong></span>, and<span class="strong"><strong> Find us!</strong></span> for these items. With the new text, your selected menu will look similar to the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — making a menu" src="graphics/1321_03_18.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">The default style of the menu isn't very compelling, so let's restyle it. Exit the editing mode of the menu by clicking the background of the ad, and then single-click the menu again to select it. However, don't enter edit mode. Expand the background section of the inspector pane to reveal the gradient strip and click on the first color box to open the color picker.<a class="indexterm" id="id126"/></li><li class="listitem">This time, we're not going to use the crayons to select our color because they offer a very limited choice. On the color picker, click the rainbow-filled circle to open the<span class="strong"><strong> color wheel</strong></span>. The color wheel gives us a large circle with the color spectrum in it, allowing selection of any color that we want. The following screenshot shows what each part of the color wheel selector is for:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — making a menu" src="graphics/1321_03_19.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">For our first color, select a light, orangey yellow by clicking the color you want on the color wheel. The preview area and iAd canvas should update to show your selection. You can click-and-drag on the color wheel to get a live update of the color you're selecting.</li><li class="listitem">Once you've found a color you like, select the second color by clicking the second color box on the gradient strip in iAd Producer to open that color in the color picker. This time choose a darker, deeper orange that complements the first. You can use the lightness slider to change between lighter or darker colors to select from.</li><li class="listitem">Now that you've selected the colors for the menu, let's make sure it's a linear gradient. A linear gradient has a start and finish color, and fades from the first to the second color. In the<span class="strong"><strong> Background</strong></span> section of the inspector pane, check whether the type under the gradient strip is<span class="strong"><strong> Linear</strong></span> and not<span class="strong"><strong> Radial</strong></span>.<a class="indexterm" id="id127"/><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note41"/>Note</h3><p>When creating linear gradients for tappable items, you should keep the top color lighter than the bottom, to create the illusion of depth. A light-to-dark gradient gives a pushed-out effect, which gives the button that realistic, tappable feel. If you need to swap around your colors, there is a button in the<span class="strong"><strong> Background</strong></span> section with two arrows on it. Clicking that will reverse the direction of the gradient.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">We've styled the inside of our menu; let's now change the border. Under the<span class="strong"><strong> Background</strong></span> section, you should see a border section; if it's not expanded, click it to reveal the border settings. Click the color box to open the color picker. Change the default white to another color, such as deep brown. We can increase the width of the border to<span class="strong"><strong> 3px</strong></span> to make it more pronounced. If you want, change the radius to<span class="strong"><strong> 20px</strong></span>, to increase the rounded corners of the menu. The border style can be changed from a solid line to dotted or dashed; however, if you try changing it you'll quickly see these don't suit the menu we're making.<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note42"/>Note</h3><p>If you've made a custom color that you'd like to save in order to access easily later, you can drag the big block of the color in the preview area to the strip of empty boxes along the bottom color picker. This is useful when you use the same custom colors throughout your ad and want to keep them consistent.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">You may have noticed the main<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> tab at the top hasn't had any styling applied to it, so let's change it to match the rest of the menu. Double-click inside the main area of the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span>, then single-click on the top part of the menu, where it says<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span>. Selecting the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> tab can be quite difficult, so don't worry if you have to try this a few times before you can select it.</li><li class="listitem">Firstly, let's get the background color of the menu tab to match the border, so it looks like one complete unit. In the inspector pane, find the<span class="strong"><strong> Background</strong></span> section, change it to a solid fill and replicate the same red we used for the border.<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note43"/>Note</h3><p>iAd Producer unfortunately hides the area on the canvas we're editing behind a dark grey mask, so you might need to deselect the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> tab occasionally to see the changes you're making.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">The darker background of the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> tab has meant the text is no longer readable, so let's change the text color. From the inspector pane, find the<span class="strong"><strong> Text</strong></span> section and expand it if you need to. Click on the block of grey color and change it to white. Here, we can see the selection of the<span class="strong"><strong> Menu</strong></span> tab with its colors adjusted:<a class="indexterm" id="id128"/><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — making a menu" src="graphics/1321_03_20.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Click back on the main ad canvas to see how the menu looks and edit any part you think needs tweaking, The menu is done!</li><li class="listitem">We've added the menu, let's now change the background of our page. Click the background on the ad canvas and open the<span class="strong"><strong> Background</strong></span> section in the inspector pane.</li><li class="listitem">We'll want the background to match the splash screen to ease the transition into our core ad unit. If you used the suggested colors for the splash screen, you'll want to change the first color to white (<span class="emphasis"><em>Snow</em></span>) from the crayon section of the color picker, and the second to orange (<span class="emphasis"><em>Cantaloupe</em></span>). The default template should have a radial gradient already applied. Check whether it does and change it if you need to.<a class="indexterm" id="id129"/><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note44"/>Note</h3><p>If you're using iAd Producer 2.0 or later, (released Q4 2011) then you can set the<span class="strong"><strong> Shared Background project</strong></span> property from the inspector pane on the ad overview. This will cause all future page backgrounds to share the same default.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">That was easy; let's add a couple of images to our advert's menu. Open up the<span class="strong"><strong> Asset Library</strong></span> by clicking the<span class="strong"><strong> Assets</strong></span> icon in the bottom-right corner of the iAd Producer window. Drag the<span class="strong"><strong> t-rex.png</strong></span> image from the<span class="strong"><strong> Asset Library</strong></span> onto the placeholder image area on the canvas. Reposition the image on the right of the canvas, so it slightly overlaps the edge of the screen.</li><li class="listitem">Now drag the<span class="strong"><strong> dino-stores-title.png</strong></span> image onto the canvas and reposition it so it is sitting next to the dinosaur. You might want to position the logo image in between the teeth of the dinosaur, as shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — making a menu" src="graphics/1321_03_21.jpg"/></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note45"/>Note</h3><p>When dragging an image onto the canvas, if you put it over the top of an existing image, the existing image will be replaced.

Select the<span class="strong"><strong> Dino Stores</strong></span> image on the canvas, and then click on the inspector pane. Find the<span class="strong"><strong> Reflection</strong></span> section and expand it, if you need to. Tick the checkbox to enable the reflection. Now, we can tweak the reflection settings to improve its appearance. Changing the<span class="strong"><strong> offset</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> 0px</strong></span> means the reflection will start precisely where the image ends, it's generally a good idea to do this. We'll leave the size at<span class="strong"><strong> 100%</strong></span>, but you can use it to crop the reflection if you don't want the whole image mirrored underneath it. The<span class="strong"><strong> strength</strong></span> is how transparent the reflection is; try a value around<span class="strong"><strong> 15%</strong></span> for a subtle and stylish reflection, similar to the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — making a menu" src="graphics/1321_03_23.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">If you haven't done so already, make sure to save your iAd.<a class="indexterm" id="id130"/></li></ol></div><div class="section" title="What just happened?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec17"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>Congratulations, you just made your first-ever menu page for an iAd.

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">We'll be adding the gallery to our existing<code class="literal"> Dino Stores</code> project.

Open the<span class="strong"><strong> Asset Library</strong></span> from the bottom bar and find the group of images labeled<span class="strong"><strong> gallery-image-1.jpg, gallery-image-2.jpg</strong></span>, and so on. Single-click the first image,<span class="strong"><strong> gallery-image-1.jpg</strong></span>; it should become highlighted. Now hold down the<span class="emphasis"><em> Shift</em></span> key on your keyboard while clicking the last image,<span class="strong"><strong> gallery-image-6.jpg</strong></span>. This will select all the images in between the two selections. With the selected group of images, drag them onto the image gallery object on the canvas.<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note47"/>Note</h3><p>Note that we're using JPG images in the gallery. Our images don't have areas of transparency, so we can use JPG and benefit from the smaller file size. If you're using your own images, the image carousel requires high-resolution images that are 304px wide and 440px high. iAd Producer automatically generates the lower-resolution resources for you.</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none">The gallery should now fill up with our images and add a 3D perspective to them.

Click the background of the ad canvas; then, open the inspector to change the background of the page.

Choose the image you want to use, for example<span class="strong"><strong> map-pin-footprint.png</strong></span>; this is a red icon, as red is used to signify destinations on iOS maps. Depending on the image, you may need to adjust the offset to center the pin over the location; for example, try pin values of<span class="strong"><strong> -9px</strong></span> for<span class="strong"><strong> Offset X</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> 5px</strong></span> for<span class="strong"><strong> Offset Y</strong></span>.
