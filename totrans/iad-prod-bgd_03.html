<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec03"/>Working with iAd Producer</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's take a look at some of the main parts of iAd Producer that you'll be using regularly, to familiarize yourself with the interface.<a class="indexterm" id="id89"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec02"/>Launch screen</h2></div></div></div><p>When you first open iAd Producer, you'll be able to start a new iPhone or iPad project from the project selector, as shown in the following screenshot. As the screen size and experience is so different between the two devices, we have to design and build ads specifically for each one:<a class="indexterm" id="id90"/>
</p><div><img alt="Launch screen" src="img/1321_03_02.jpg"/></div><p>From the launch screen, you can also open existing projects you've been working on.<a class="indexterm" id="id91"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec03"/>Default ad</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you have chosen to create either an iPad or iPhone iAd, a placeholder ad is created for you, showing the visual flow. This is the overview of your ad, which you'll be using to piece the sections of your ad together. The following screenshot shows the default overview:<a class="indexterm" id="id92"/>
</p><div><img alt="Default ad" src="img/1321_03_03.jpg"/></div><p>Double-clicking on any of the screens in your ad flow will ask you to pick a template for that page; once assigned, you're then able to design the iAd using the canvas editor.<a class="indexterm" id="id93"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec04"/>Template selector</h2></div></div></div><p>Before we edit any page of an ad, we have to apply a template to it, even if it's just a blank canvas to build upon. iAd Producer automatically shows the relevant templates to the current page you're editing. This means your ad follows a structure that the users expect. Templates provide some great starting points for your iAd, whether it's for a simple banner with an image and text or a 3D image carousel that the user can flick and manipulate, all created with easy point and click. The following screenshot is an example of the template chooser:<a class="indexterm" id="id94"/>
</p><div><img alt="Template selector" src="img/1321_03_04.jpg"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec05"/>Asset Library</h2></div></div></div><p>The Asset Library holds all the media and content for your iAd, such as the images, videos, and audio. When adding media to your<strong> Asset Library</strong>, make sure you're using high-resolution images for the high-resolution Retina display. iAd Producer automatically generates the lower-resolution images for your ad, whenever you import resources.<a class="indexterm" id="id95"/>
</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note29"/>Note</h3><p>If you wanted an image to be 200px wide and 300px high, you should double the horizontal and vertical pixels to 400px wide and 600px high. This will mean your graphics look crisp and awesome on the high-resolution screens.</p></div><p>The following screenshot shows an example of media in the<strong> Asset Library:</strong>
<a class="indexterm" id="id96"/>
</p><div><img alt="Asset Library" src="img/1321_03_05.jpg"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec06"/>Ad canvas</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you've selected a template, you can double-click on the item in the<strong> Overview</strong> to open up the canvas for that page. The ad canvas is where you customize your iAd with a powerful visual editor to manipulate each page of your ad. Here's an example of the ad canvas with a video carousel added to it:<a class="indexterm" id="id97"/>
</p><div><img alt="Ad canvas" src="img/1321_03_06.jpg"/></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec04"/>Setting up your ad</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's create and save an empty project to use as we create our iAd; you'll only need to do this once for each ad.<a class="indexterm" id="id98"/>
</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note30"/>Note</h3><p>Whenever you're working with something digital, it's important to save your iAd whenever you make a significant change, in case iAd Producer closes unexpectedly. Try to get into the habit of saving regularly, to avoid losing your ad.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec05"/>Time for action — creating a new project</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to create a new project, follow the ensuing steps:<a class="indexterm" id="id99"/>

If you quit this project you can now open the project from within iAd Producer by clicking on<strong> File</strong> |<strong> Open</strong>, from the menu bar; or, simply double-click the<code class="literal"> project</code> file in Finder to automatically open it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec06"/>Getting the resources</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we'll be using the<code class="literal"> Dino Stores</code> example resources that are available to download with this book. If you want to use your own assets, you'll need the following media:<a class="indexterm" id="id100"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An image for your banner, approximately 120px wide and 100px high</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An image of your company logo or name, around 420px wide and 45px high</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An 80px square image, with transparency, to be used as a map pin</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A loading image, approximately 600px wide and 400px high</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Between six and 10 images for a gallery, each around 304px wide and 440px high</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Two or more images that will change when the iPhone is shaken, each around 600px wide and 800px high</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An image related to your product or service, at least 300px wide, to use on the main menu page</li></ul></div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note31"/>Note</h3><p>These pixel sizes are at double-size to account for the high-resolution Retina display found on the iPhone 4 and later. iAd Producer will automatically create the lower-resolution versions for older devices.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec07"/>Building your banner</h1></div></div></div><p>The banner is the hook to encourage the viewer to click and explore your iAd.

</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec08"/>Time for action — making the banner</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to make the banner, follow the ensuing steps:<a class="indexterm" id="id102"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Open up the<code class="literal"> Dino Stores</code> project and double-click on the<strong> Banner</strong> in the ad overview. It should be the first item on screen.</li><li class="listitem">Before you're able to edit any page of your ad, you need to assign a template to it. From the template chooser, you should see the available templates for banners. In this banner, we'll be using<strong> Image and Text</strong>; select this template and click on<strong> Choose</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">After choosing the banner type, select the banner again, from the iAd overview. You should now have the banner canvas open, ready to customize the banner, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="Time for action — making the banner" src="img/1321_03_07.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">The first item that we'll change is the<strong> Banner Message</strong>.

They're called this because the user of the iAd cannot edit them. For editable areas of text, we can use a text box.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Now let's make the text slightly bigger and center it, so it sits correctly in the banner. Click on the text again, so a selection box appears around it, and then click on the<strong> Inspector</strong> option in the lower-right corner of iAd Producer. This opens the<strong> inspector pane</strong>, which is used to adjust the appearance and styling of elements in your iAd.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="note32"/>Note</h3><p>The inspector pane can be toggled to open and closed by clicking on the icon again. You can use this to enlarge the maximum area available to the canvas so that you can edit your ad with more precision.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">In the inspector pane, click on the<strong> Text</strong> section to expand the text formatting options. We can center the text with the middle button in the alignment setting, then increase the font size to around<strong> 25</strong>. You can see the font size and alignment highlighted in the following screenshot:<a class="indexterm" id="id104"/></li></ol></div><div><img alt="Time for action — making the banner" src="img/1321_03_08.jpg"/></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec08"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>We selected the<strong> Image and Text</strong> template to create the base layout of our banner. Then, we used the ad canvas for the first time, to edit the default. Now you know how to select a template, then edit and adjust its text and appearance.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec09"/>Have a go hero — writing good banner text</h2></div></div></div><p>When writing the text for your banner, you can use certain language and words to entice and grab your user's attention so they'll tap your banner. Consider updating your banner to use a call to action, where you combine the following:<a class="indexterm" id="id105"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An actioning verb to encourage the user to tap the banner, such as, "try", "join", "take", "find out", "create", or "play"</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A word to add value or importance in order to motivate the tap action, such as free, now, or fast</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Keep content to a minimum, so as to not deter the user from reading it</li></ul></div><p>The following screenshot shows an example of a complete call to action:</p><div><img alt="Have a go hero — writing good banner text" src="img/1321_03_09.jpg"/></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec09"/>Time for action — changing the background</h1></div></div></div><p>We have edited the text on our banner; let's now change the background to make it more prominent in the applications that it will appear in. We'll use a gradient to fill the background, fading between two colors.<a class="indexterm" id="id106"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Click away from the label on the grey background to select the background properties in the inspector pane. Now click<strong> Background</strong>, to open the background properties section.</li><li class="listitem">A<strong> radial gradient</strong> had already been selected for us when we chose the banner template, so we only need to change the two colors that make the background.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="note33"/>Note</h3><p>A radial gradient is a smooth transition between two colors; think of them as blending two colored circles into one, from the center of the area they are filling.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">You should see a white-to-grey gradient strip with a small arrow and box at each end; click the box on the left to open the color selector. The color selector has a variety of ways to choose a color. We'll be using the simplest—the crayon selector. Select this by clicking the crayon box on the color selector. In the following screenshot, we can see the<strong> Background</strong> section along with the crayon color selector:<a class="indexterm" id="id107"/><div><img alt="Time for action — changing the background" src="img/1321_03_09(2).jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">We now have a selection of crayons to pick our color from. The first color we select is the inside of your radial gradient; select the naturally prehistoric orange (named<em> Cantaloupe)</em> from the bottom-left of the colors. You should see the inside of your banner turn to that color. If it hasn't, make sure that the first box on the gradient strip is selected and try again.</li><li class="listitem">Next, select the small gray box on the right of the gradient strip to change the outside color of the radial gradient. We'll change the outer color to white (named<em> Snow)</em>, the far-right crayon on the bottom. Once both the colors have been selected, you can close the color picker.</li><li class="listitem">We can now fine tune the gradient by dragging the orange box on the left about one quarter of the way towards the right. This changes the start point of where the gradient fades, so more of the orange is visible in the center.</li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec10"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>We just used the inbuilt gradients in iAd Producer to create a gradient with code instead of images, meaning they can scale to the high-or low-resolution screens with no loss of quality, while having a significantly smaller file size. iAd Producer automatically produces the CSS.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec11"/>Have a go hero — learning about CSS3 gradients</h2></div></div></div><p>

</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">To add an image into our iAd, we need to add our media into the<strong> Asset Library</strong> of iAd Producer.

</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">To see how the current banner looks in landscape, select<strong> View</strong> then<strong> Landscape</strong> from the menu bar.

Double-click the page again to open it on the canvas.</li><li class="listitem">Open the<strong> Asset Library</strong> pane from the<strong> Assets</strong> option, on the right of the bottom bar. This should show all the assets we imported earlier. Drag<strong> Pterodactyl.png</strong> to the large image placeholder box on our splash's canvas.</li><li class="listitem">You may have noticed our pterodactyl's wings and head have got cut off. We can fix this by resizing the image box using the drag handles. Once you've changed the size of the image box to show the entire image, make sure it is still centered by dragging the entire image, so that a yellow line appears down the middle of the canvas and the image snaps to it. This is iAd Producer suggesting the ideal position for it. The following screenshot is an example of the yellowlined, suggested positioning in iAd Producer:<div><img alt="Time for action — making the splash screen" src="img/1321_03_13.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">We've added the image into our splash; now, we'll customize the text. The<strong> Bouncing Logo</strong> template comes with a<code class="literal"> Multi-Label</code> object, similar to a standard label, but it let's us change between different messages with a transition.<a class="indexterm" id="id117"/></li><li class="listitem">Double-click on the<strong> multi-label</strong>; at the moment, it should say<strong> Loading Message 1</strong>. This opens the multi-label editor and fades out the rest of the canvas while we edit it.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the text again to highlight it and replace it with your own message, say<strong> It's taken 180 million years</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">To move the message to the next cell, the sub-label of the multi-label, click the down arrow to the right of<strong> 1 of 3 cells</strong>. In the following screenshot, this cell navigation arrow is highlighted:<div><img alt="Time for action — making the splash screen" src="img/1321_03_14.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now, enter the text for the second cell, say<code class="literal"> but finally..</code>. Move on to the third cell and add the final message, for example,<code class="literal"> they're here</code>.</li><li class="listitem">iAd Producer will now automatically transition between these cells, while our ad is loading. To ensure our message gets a chance to complete a full cycle, we need to adjust the timing of the multi-label. We'll change the time each cell is visible for and the length of the transition, and make sure the splash is visible for a certain time.</li><li class="listitem">To change the multi-label duration, click anywhere outside of the cell to exit the editing mode. Now single-click back on the multi-label to select it, but don't enter back into the editing mode. If the inspector pane isn't visible, open it up and find the<strong> Effects</strong> section. We'll want to change the<strong> By Letter</strong> to<strong> Line</strong>. This means the effect is applied to an entire line at a time, instead of each individual letter. Check that the<strong> Show For</strong> is<strong> 2s</strong> and the<strong> Hide For</strong> is<strong> 0.5s</strong>; change these if they're not. Your final effects should look like the following screenshot:<a class="indexterm" id="id118"/><div><img alt="Time for action — making the splash screen" src="img/1321_03_15.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now let's change the minimum duration of the splash to<strong> 7.5s</strong>. Click the background of the iAd to modify the main splash properties. In the inspector pane, change the<strong> Show Page for at Least</strong> value to<strong> 7.5s</strong>, by dragging the slider to the right.<a class="indexterm" id="id119"/><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note38"/>Note</h3><p>We chose a minimum duration of<strong> 7.5s</strong> , as this allows the entire effect animation on the multi-label cell to complete. Each cell is visible for 2 seconds and hidden for 0.5 seconds, making a total of 2.5 seconds. Then we have three cells in total, making a total duration of 3 x 2.5 seconds, or 7.5 seconds. It's important to keep the splash screen visible for as little time as possible, to prevent the user from closing your ad before they even reach the content!</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Finally, we'll add a background gradient to our splash. Under the<strong> Show Page for at Least</strong>, find the<strong> Background</strong> section. Just as we did with the background of our banner, we'll use a radial gradient. We're going to click on the first color on the gradient strip and select<em> Snow</em>, the white crayon on the bottom right. Now click the second color box on the gradient strip and choose<em> Cantaloupe</em> from the bottom left.</li><li class="listitem">Save your project from the<strong> File</strong> menu. That's our final splash, and it'll look similar to the following screenshot:<a class="indexterm" id="id120"/><div><img alt="Time for action — making the splash screen" src="img/1321_03_16.jpg"/></div></li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec15"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>We've now made our first splash screen, transitioning the user into the core ad unit. You modified the animation effect timings to ensure the full splash animation gets viewed by the user.</p><p>As our splash page includes animations that can't be previewed in iAd Producer, let's take a quick look at how to simulate them using Safari.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec14"/>Previewing the ad</h1></div></div></div><p>Whilst iAd Producer gives a great overview of the positions, styling, and flow of your iAd, it doesn't show us animations or let us interact with our ad. Fortunately, as each iAd is built using the latest web technologies, we're able to use<strong> Safari</strong>, the built-in web browser on your Mac. Safari uses the same engine to display web pages as the iPhone, so the representation should be accurate; however, remember your Mac is a lot faster than your iPhone, so performance may be worse on that device.<a class="indexterm" id="id121"/>
</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec15"/>Time for action — testing your iAd</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's take a moment from building our iAd to check over the<code class="literal"> Dino Stores</code> ad that we've been creating so far to check that the animations provided by the templates and multi-labels are working:<a class="indexterm" id="id122"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">If it isn't open already, open the<code class="literal"> Dino Stores</code> project that we've been working on and open up the banner on the canvas editor. You might need to return to the overview to find the banner.</li><li class="listitem">From the menu bar, select<strong> Export</strong> then<strong> Preview in Safari</strong>. This will open Safari, with your banner in it. You should see the text slide in from the right and the image fade up. Don't worry if you can see the text before it enters the main banner area, which would be out of the visible frame on the iPhone.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="note39"/>Note</h3><p>You might have noticed that the iAd logo and frame is missing from the preview in Safari, this is added by the iAd system on the iOS devices and is not available in Safari.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Let's view the animation again by refreshing the page. From the menu bar in Safari, choose<strong> View</strong> and then<strong> Reload page</strong>. If you make changes to your iAd in iAd Producer, reloading the page won't show the updated iAd, so you'll have to go back into iAd Producer and choose<strong> Preview in Safari</strong>, again, to update it.</li><li class="listitem">If you're happy with the banner, open the splash in iAd Producer and select<strong> Export</strong> and then<strong> Preview in Safari</strong>, from the menu bar.</li></ol></div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note40"/>Note</h3><p>Whenever you're working on an iAd with animations or effects in it, you can preview the iAd at any time to see how it will look when using this technique.</p></div><div><img alt="Time for action — testing your iAd" src="img/1321_03_17.jpg"/></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec16"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>You just previewed what your ad looks like running in Safari—just like in the previous screenshot. In the next chapter, we'll look at device testing being able to touch our ads and immerse ourselves, which makes it much easier to get a feel of what our iAd experience will be like.<a class="indexterm" id="id123"/>
</p><p>Now that we've seen how our banner and splash page are going to look, let's continue building the rest of our ad.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec16"/>Adding a menu</h1></div></div></div><p>The menu is the root view of our core ad unit and is used as the primary navigation between the subviews of our iAd. The flow of the ad typically means users will go from the menu to a page, then back to the menu and on to another page.<a class="indexterm" id="id124"/>
</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec17"/>Time for action — making a menu</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's make a menu for our iAd that will allow access to the three pages in our ad—an image gallery, a shakeable image view, and a store finder. To make the menu, follow the ensuing steps:<a class="indexterm" id="id125"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">If you haven't done so already, open up iAd Producer and the<code class="literal"> Dino Stores</code> project we've been working on. From the overview screen, double-click the<strong> Menu</strong> page in the app. Then, flow to open the template chooser.</li><li class="listitem">For this menu, we'll use the<code class="literal"> Hide-Reveal</code> template, which gives us a menu that slides out to the bottom when we change pages and that can slide back in when the user wants to get back to the main menu. Select this template and click<strong> choose</strong>. Double-click the<strong> Hide-Reveal</strong> menu in the ad flow to open up the menu canvas.</li><li class="listitem">Double-click the menu area to open its editing mode. Then, double-click on<strong> Page 1</strong> to change the text. The first page of our ad will be the image gallery, so enter some text, say<strong> View our pets</strong>. Repeat this for the next two items, the shakable image view and the store finder. You could use<strong> All shapes and sizes</strong>, and<strong> Find us!</strong> for these items. With the new text, your selected menu will look similar to the following screenshot:<div><img alt="Time for action — making a menu" src="img/1321_03_18.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">The default style of the menu isn't very compelling, so let's restyle it. Exit the editing mode of the menu by clicking the background of the ad, and then single-click the menu again to select it. However, don't enter edit mode. Expand the background section of the inspector pane to reveal the gradient strip and click on the first color box to open the color picker.<a class="indexterm" id="id126"/></li><li class="listitem">This time, we're not going to use the crayons to select our color because they offer a very limited choice. On the color picker, click the rainbow-filled circle to open the<strong> color wheel</strong>. The color wheel gives us a large circle with the color spectrum in it, allowing selection of any color that we want. The following screenshot shows what each part of the color wheel selector is for:<div><img alt="Time for action — making a menu" src="img/1321_03_19.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">For our first color, select a light, orangey yellow by clicking the color you want on the color wheel. The preview area and iAd canvas should update to show your selection. You can click-and-drag on the color wheel to get a live update of the color you're selecting.</li><li class="listitem">Once you've found a color you like, select the second color by clicking the second color box on the gradient strip in iAd Producer to open that color in the color picker. This time choose a darker, deeper orange that complements the first. You can use the lightness slider to change between lighter or darker colors to select from.</li><li class="listitem">Now that you've selected the colors for the menu, let's make sure it's a linear gradient. A linear gradient has a start and finish color, and fades from the first to the second color. In the<strong> Background</strong> section of the inspector pane, check whether the type under the gradient strip is<strong> Linear</strong> and not<strong> Radial</strong>.<a class="indexterm" id="id127"/><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note41"/>Note</h3><p>When creating linear gradients for tappable items, you should keep the top color lighter than the bottom, to create the illusion of depth. A light-to-dark gradient gives a pushed-out effect, which gives the button that realistic, tappable feel. If you need to swap around your colors, there is a button in the<strong> Background</strong> section with two arrows on it. Clicking that will reverse the direction of the gradient.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">We've styled the inside of our menu; let's now change the border. Under the<strong> Background</strong> section, you should see a border section; if it's not expanded, click it to reveal the border settings. Click the color box to open the color picker. Change the default white to another color, such as deep brown. We can increase the width of the border to<strong> 3px</strong> to make it more pronounced. If you want, change the radius to<strong> 20px</strong>, to increase the rounded corners of the menu. The border style can be changed from a solid line to dotted or dashed; however, if you try changing it you'll quickly see these don't suit the menu we're making.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="note42"/>Note</h3><p>If you've made a custom color that you'd like to save in order to access easily later, you can drag the big block of the color in the preview area to the strip of empty boxes along the bottom color picker. This is useful when you use the same custom colors throughout your ad and want to keep them consistent.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">You may have noticed the main<strong> Menu</strong> tab at the top hasn't had any styling applied to it, so let's change it to match the rest of the menu. Double-click inside the main area of the<strong> Menu</strong>, then single-click on the top part of the menu, where it says<strong> Menu</strong>. Selecting the<strong> Menu</strong> tab can be quite difficult, so don't worry if you have to try this a few times before you can select it.</li><li class="listitem">Firstly, let's get the background color of the menu tab to match the border, so it looks like one complete unit. In the inspector pane, find the<strong> Background</strong> section, change it to a solid fill and replicate the same red we used for the border.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="note43"/>Note</h3><p>iAd Producer unfortunately hides the area on the canvas we're editing behind a dark grey mask, so you might need to deselect the<strong> Menu</strong> tab occasionally to see the changes you're making.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">The darker background of the<strong> Menu</strong> tab has meant the text is no longer readable, so let's change the text color. From the inspector pane, find the<strong> Text</strong> section and expand it if you need to. Click on the block of grey color and change it to white. Here, we can see the selection of the<strong> Menu</strong> tab with its colors adjusted:<a class="indexterm" id="id128"/><div><img alt="Time for action — making a menu" src="img/1321_03_20.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Click back on the main ad canvas to see how the menu looks and edit any part you think needs tweaking, The menu is done!</li><li class="listitem">We've added the menu, let's now change the background of our page. Click the background on the ad canvas and open the<strong> Background</strong> section in the inspector pane.</li><li class="listitem">We'll want the background to match the splash screen to ease the transition into our core ad unit. If you used the suggested colors for the splash screen, you'll want to change the first color to white (<em>Snow</em>) from the crayon section of the color picker, and the second to orange (<em>Cantaloupe</em>). The default template should have a radial gradient already applied. Check whether it does and change it if you need to.<a class="indexterm" id="id129"/><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note44"/>Note</h3><p>If you're using iAd Producer 2.0 or later, (released Q4 2011) then you can set the<strong> Shared Background project</strong> property from the inspector pane on the ad overview. This will cause all future page backgrounds to share the same default.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">That was easy; let's add a couple of images to our advert's menu. Open up the<strong> Asset Library</strong> by clicking the<strong> Assets</strong> icon in the bottom-right corner of the iAd Producer window. Drag the<strong> t-rex.png</strong> image from the<strong> Asset Library</strong> onto the placeholder image area on the canvas. Reposition the image on the right of the canvas, so it slightly overlaps the edge of the screen.</li><li class="listitem">Now drag the<strong> dino-stores-title.png</strong> image onto the canvas and reposition it so it is sitting next to the dinosaur. You might want to position the logo image in between the teeth of the dinosaur, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="Time for action — making a menu" src="img/1321_03_21.jpg"/></div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note45"/>Note</h3><p>When dragging an image onto the canvas, if you put it over the top of an existing image, the existing image will be replaced. If you want to have overlapping images you need to drag the new image to a place on the canvas that doesn't already have one, then reposition it.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Let's add a reflection to the<code class="literal"> dino-stores-title.png</code> image. Select the<strong> Dino Stores</strong> image on the canvas, and then click on the inspector pane. Find the<strong> Reflection</strong> section and expand it, if you need to. Tick the checkbox to enable the reflection. Now, we can tweak the reflection settings to improve its appearance. Changing the<strong> offset</strong> to<strong> 0px</strong> means the reflection will start precisely where the image ends, it's generally a good idea to do this. We'll leave the size at<strong> 100%</strong>, but you can use it to crop the reflection if you don't want the whole image mirrored underneath it. The<strong> strength</strong> is how transparent the reflection is; try a value around<strong> 15%</strong> for a subtle and stylish reflection, similar to the following screenshot:<div><img alt="Time for action — making a menu" src="img/1321_03_23.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">If you haven't done so already, make sure to save your iAd.<a class="indexterm" id="id130"/></li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec17"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>Congratulations, you just made your first-ever menu page for an iAd.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec21"/>Time for action — store finder</h1></div></div></div><p>This will be the final page of our<code class="literal"> Dino Stores</code> iAd; we'll be using nearby Apple Stores as an example location set.<a class="indexterm" id="id141"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">If you're not continuing on from the last exercise, open iAd Producer and select the project that we've been working on. Go to the ad overview There should still be one page without a template; this is the final page in our iAd. Double-click<strong> Page 3</strong> and select the<strong> Map</strong> template.</li><li class="listitem">Once you've selected the template, double-click the page to open it in the canvas editor. Let's start by customizing the map; click the placeholder map area in the center of the canvas and open it in the inspector pane.</li><li class="listitem">In the<strong> Properties</strong> section, find the<strong> Site ID</strong>. By default, this is set to<strong> demo</strong>; it is the example ID used by Apple and shows the location of their Apple retail stores. You'd typically update this to your own<strong> Site ID</strong>, which needs to be set up by Apple. When you partner with Apple for the iAd Program, you can contact them to request one.</li><li class="listitem">The<strong> Radius</strong> value defines how far from the user's location the ad should look for stores. Depending on how many stores you have, you might want to change this; the higher number or density of your stores, the lower the search radius should be. For the demo<strong> Site ID</strong>, set this to<strong> 50mi</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Still in the properties section, click the drop-down file selector in the<strong> Custom Pin</strong> to select a custom image to show each store location. Choose the image you want to use, for example<strong> map-pin-footprint.png</strong>; this is a red icon, as red is used to signify destinations on iOS maps. Depending on the image, you may need to adjust the offset to center the pin over the location; for example, try pin values of<strong> -9px</strong> for<strong> Offset X</strong> and<strong> 5px</strong> for<strong> Offset Y</strong>. Your pin should appear centered in the map on canvas, such as the one shown in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="Time for action — store finder" src="img/1321_03_26.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">That's the<strong> Map</strong> view finished, but let's add a couple of visual tweaks to it so that it looks even better. With the<strong> Map</strong> view selected, scroll down to the border section of the inspector pane and add a<strong> 4px</strong>, solid-white border to frame the map.<a class="indexterm" id="id142"/></li><li class="listitem">Let's also add some shadow to pop the map out from the background. Below the border section, enable<strong> Drop Shadow</strong> by ticking the checkbox and click the color to open the color picker. Change the opacity slider to a lower setting, around<strong> 40%</strong> or so, to reduce the transparency of the shadow and make it less harsh on the screen.</li><li class="listitem">With the map view styling finished, let's now add radial gradient to the page background. Click the canvas and expand the<strong> Background</strong> section in the inspector pane. Add the gradient you've been using throughout the ad. If you've been using the suggested gradient, choose<em> Snow</em> and<em> Cantaloupe</em> as the colors from the crayon color picker.</li><li class="listitem">Let's change the<strong> Locations</strong> text to something like<code class="literal"> Find a store ..</code>. by double-clicking on the label to enter editing mode.</li><li class="listitem">Let's also add the number for our head office. The template doesn't provide any other labels with this template, so we need to add our own. On the left of the bottom bar, click on the<strong> Objects</strong> icon to open the<code class="literal"> object</code> library, and scroll down till you find the<strong> Label</strong> object, as shown in the following screenshot. Select it to add an empty label onto the canvas;<div><img alt="Time for action — store finder" src="img/1321_03_27.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Double-click the new label on the canvas to enter editing mode. Enter some text, say<code class="literal"> Call us: 555-1051</code>. You might need to resize the width of the text area to fit the whole message. Now, move the text area to the bottom of the screen.<div><h3 class="title"><a id="note51"/>Note</h3><p>You might have to make the map smaller and move the label away from the bottom of the screen. The slide-reveal menu template we're using adds the top part of the menu to each page of the ad, so that the user can get back to the main page. Preview the ad in Safari to see if you need to reposition it—navigate to the ad overview and choose<strong> Export</strong> |<strong> Preview in Safari</strong> from the menu bar. The menu will only show up if you start the preview from the overview and then click the<strong> menu</strong> to navigate to that page.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Once you're happy with the positioning of the label, save your completed iAd!</li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec25"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>We just added the last page to our iAd so customers can find our nearest stores.
