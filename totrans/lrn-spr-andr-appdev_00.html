<p>This book is designed to develop both server and client for an application. We have used the Kotlin language for both the server and client sides. In this book, Spring will be the server-side application, and Android the client-side application. Our primary focus is on those areas that will be able to help a developer develop a secure application with the latest architecture. This book describes the basics of Kotlin and Spring, which will be of benefit if you are unfamiliar with these platforms. We also designed the chapters for implementing security and database in a project. This book delves into the use of Retrofit for handling HTTP requests and SQLite Room for storing data in an Android device. You will also be able to find a way of how to develop a robust, reactive project. Then, you will learn how to test a project using JUnit and Espresso for developing a less bug-prone and stable project.</p>

<p>This book is designed for those developers who are new to Kotlin who wish to develop projects with Spring and Android. Spring for Android provides a functional REST client that supports marshaling objects from JSON. Developers depend on other language platforms, such as PHP and Python for REST API, but Spring comes with Java/Kotlin and a rich content that helps developers to use REST API with the maximum security. There are some dependencies in the application code and Spring removes these dependencies. Nowadays, Java is being replaced by Kotlin, which is lighter and requires fewer lines of code to finish the job.</p>

<p><a href="bfdcd6b3-5a5a-4fc7-af79-67e780f46ccb.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>About the Environment</em><span>, creates an environment for both the server side and client side. We will also look into the types of tools that will be needed for the project. We will also understand what we can create with a platform using Spring and Android.</span></p>
<p><a href="ec547467-06b8-4f0c-a4be-ba38ff1eac1b.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Overview of Kotlin</em><span>, covers the basics of Kotlin and examines how to set up the environment and which tools or IDEs are available for Kotlin, including basic syntax and types. We will see the flow structures, including <kbd>if-else</kbd> statements, <kbd>for</kbd> loops, and <kbd>while</kbd> loops. We will also look into the object-oriented programming for Kotlin and cover classes, interfaces, objects, and so on. Functions will also be covered, along with parameters, constructors, and syntax. We will also explain null safety, reflection, and annotations, which are the core features of Kotlin.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><a href="5bf1668f-e909-4dff-837b-49e441bd0f47.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Overview of Spring Framework</em><span>, covers the basics of Spring Framework and readers will learn how to configure Spring and beans. Dependency injection will be explained in this chapter, along with the architecture of Spring. Readers will learn about Spring MVC and Spring Boot, which are helpful for developing the application as quickly as possible. Spring Data modules will also be explained. We will also cover Spring Security, which provides authentication and other securities for the applications.</span></p>
<p><a href="ee961da7-427b-4435-b7aa-6c5c541c89a6.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Spring Modules for Android</em><span>, covers the RestTemplate and Retrofit modules that are connected to the Android projects. An explanation of HTTP clients is provided. Objects to JSON marshaling will also be covered. We will learn how to start and set up the environment. HTTP request methods for both the RestTemplate and Retrofit modules, such as <kbd>POST</kbd>, <kbd>GET</kbd>, <kbd>UPDATE</kbd>, and <kbd>DELETE</kbd>, will also be covered, along with the common functionality of other Spring modules and Maven dependency management.</span></p>
<p><a href="d27e39f7-8dea-4796-9025-cfb8bc345283.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Securing Applications with Spring Security</em><span>, covers the requirements for Spring Security. We will learn how to register and configure security and authentication in the web server. We will also learn about the architecture of Spring Security and how to use it for clients. We will see the approach to securing an API for Android application and what the security flow will be. We will learn how to use Spring Security in relation to the REST API. Use of the basic authentication, OAuth2, implicit flow, and the authorization code flow will also be discussed. We will also learn how to connect with Android projects and use basic authentication.</span></p>
<p><a href="1f77948f-747b-42f1-b15b-fec3910d97d6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Accessing the Database</em><span>, covers the existing Spring data modules. We will also cover JDBC, JPA, H2, MySQL for Spring, and SQLite Room for Android. We will also learn about the use of JPA to create REST API in Spring and fetch the APIs and handle the contents in Android.</span></p>
<p><a href="a91260f3-1e05-4cec-9fc6-b459de9b9eb7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Concurrency</em><span>, </span><span>covers coroutines, including topics such as concurrency, parallelism, and thread pools.</span> <span>We will also learn about</span> <span>sequential operations and callback hell.</span></p>

<p><a href="7f273ca8-ce1d-4577-b24c-26d0957f1c74.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Creating an Application</em><span>, starts with the installation of the Android environment. We will then configure Spring on the web server and make a project design. We will then create UI, layout, and RESTful web services and retrieve JSON from the APIs. We will also learn to use Spring Boot and Spring Security for the app. We will then learn how to use Basic Auth to secure the data and give access to users. We will use secured REST API for an Android app and how to handle contents in Android. This application will be based on Kotlin, and we will be taking advantage of the features of Kotlin features, features including null safety, reflection, and annotation, in this application.</span></p>
<p><a href="9ce60363-adfb-4e1c-89f4-ec573a89657d.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Testing an Application</em>, <span>deals with Spring testing. This includes unit, integration, and UI testing, and their uses. We will get to know the test structure for the project, along with the testing tools such as JUnit and Espresso. Test cases for JUnit and JPA will also be discussed. We will learn how to write UI test cases for the Android application. We will also learn to execute these tests via Android Studio. We will also learn how to test UI using Espresso in Kotlin, and its uses in relation to Kotlin in the Android app. We will also look into</span> <span>concurrency and reactive programming in the application.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Conventions used</h1>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>The </span><kbd>switch { ... }</kbd><span> control flow element is replaced by </span><kbd>when { ... }</kbd><span>.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre><span>fun </span><span>test</span>() {<br/>    Bar.<span>NAME<br/></span><span>    </span>Bar.printName()<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>&lt;!-- A bean example with singleton scope --&gt;<br/>&lt;bean id = "..." class = "..." <strong>scope = "singleton"</strong>/&gt;<br/>&lt;!-- You can remove the scope for the singleton --&gt;<br/>&lt;bean id = "..." class = "..."/&gt;</pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ mkdir css</strong><br/><strong>$ cd css</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
