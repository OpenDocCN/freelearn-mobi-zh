This book shows you how to obtain the certificates that ensure payment information is securely transmitted between the user's iOS device, your payment gateway, and the banks involved in an Apple Pay transaction. The book teaches you how to provide a simple and consistent user experience, which expedites the time between desire and acquire. You learn how to respond to changes that the user makes to your preconfigured payment sheet, which is where the user confirms or modifies order and payment details. This book guides you through the interactions that your app makes with your payment gateway and your order-processing system. Finally, this book shows you how to design a simple order-processing web app that processes orders and payments submitted by client apps.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with Apple Pay">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Apple Pay</em></span>, describes how online payments work in general, and it introduces Apple Pay—a simpler and more secure online payment model. This chapter also shows you how to obtain the Apple Pay merchant certificates that ensure that only the appropriate entities have access to sensitive payment information.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Payment Request Workflow">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Payment Request Workflow</em></span>, describes how to create a payment request, which is an object that stores information that is critical to payment processing (such as currency and payment network requirements) and details about the customer's order. It also shows you how to manage the main elements of the Apple Pay user experience: the <span class="strong"><strong>Apple </strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Pay</strong></span> button, and the payment sheet. This chapter also explains how to get inventory details from an order-processing web app, and how to present product information to the user.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Payment Authorization Workflow">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Payment Authorization Workflow</em></span>, shows you how your app should respond to payment sheet events, such as shipping address change, and user authorization of the payment.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Payment Processing Workflow">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Payment Processing Workflow</em></span>, describes the actors and operations involved in processing a payment, including your order processing web app.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Designing an Order Management Server">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Designing an Order Management Server</em></span>, describes the main components of an order management server, including its data structure, and client API.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Apple Pay API Summary">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Apple Pay API Summary</em></span>, summarizes the API that is used for Apple Pay transactions.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>To follow along with the content presented in this book, which is based on the book's example code, you need the hardware and software needed for iOS development: a development Mac, an iOS device that supports Apple Pay, and a recent version of the Xcode developer tools. You need to be able to build apps on your Mac and run them on the iOS device, which requires a wired connection between the computer and the device (so that Xcode can install the app on the device). When running the example app on iOS Simulator, the example app connects to the order management web app running on the computer through a URI that targets the appropriate process. When running the app on the iOS device, however, the connection must be done wirelessly. Therefore, you need to configure your development Mac as a proxy server so that HTTP requests to the order management web app from the iOS device are resolved by the web app on the computer and do not go to the wider network. The documentation in the example code explains how to configure your development Mac as a proxy server using the SquidMan proxy-server software.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended for people who want to learn how to incorporate Apple Pay into their iOS apps so that their customers can pay for goods and services quickly and securely.
