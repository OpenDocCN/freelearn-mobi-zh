                    <h1 class="header-title">Native, Hybrid, or Cross-Platform</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Most developers are well aware of the fact that when it comes to market share, bigger isn't necessarily better. That is, Android's larger market size doesn't make it the better choice for app development. Likewise, iOS's greater developer payouts in and of themselves shouldn't turn you into a convert. So, what should you focus on when choosing your platform?</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll take a pragmatic approach to answering this question. In short, we will explore the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The real-world factors that could have a large influence on your platform choice, such as your audience's needs, your technical needs, and your technical capabilities</li>
<li>The strengths and weaknesses of native apps and hybrid apps, and the pros and cons of each</li>
<li>Cross-platform development tools that could allow you to develop on both platforms simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start by looking at the most fundamental questions first.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Who is your audience?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<div><img class="image-border" height="216" src="img/8de15c8e-67da-4cc3-ac5f-a47577eef625.png" width="410"/></div>
<p>Your target audience may prefer one platform over the other or they may be spread evenly across both. Knowing as much as possible about your audience will help you determine many things about your app, including whether to go native or hybrid. When performing research, look beyond pre-existing concepts and stereotypes.</p>
<p>For instance, most of us are probably already aware of the superficial differences between iOS users and Android users. That is, iOS users are more affluent, better educated, and younger, while Android users are the opposite.</p>
<p>A number of studies also suggest that, despite Android's market penetration, iOS users are more willing to dish out money for apps. Apple reported that <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/01/app-store-shatters-records-on-new-years-day.html">$20 billion</a> was paid out to developers in 2016 (refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/01/app-store-shatters-records-on-new-years-day.html">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/01/app-store-shatters-records-on-new-years-day.html</a>), and App Annie reported that although the Google Play Store has twice as many downloads as the App Store, iOS apps turn out twice as much profit (refer to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bgr.com/2016/07/20/ios-vs-android-developers-profits-app-store-google-play/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1501582800060000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJYS1AAoGra88ceEN2y6y87UdA7g">https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bgr.com/2016/07/20/ios-vs-android-developers-profits-app-store-google-play/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1501582800060000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJYS1AAoGra88ceEN2y6y87UdA7g</a>).</p>
<p>Should these numbers make the decision for you? Maybe so, if your revenue model depends on earning money from your app. If not, then you need to focus on what matters to your audience. When exploring your potential audience, always look beneath the surface of such widespread reports. They are often too abstract to offer any real insight. Instead, do in-depth research using competitive intelligence tools, such as App Annie or Flurry, and work with market researchers to collect your own data.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Measure - don't guess or use intuition</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The numbers for a given market segment may not reflect the industry average, so you should drill well below the "Apple users are more affluent" stereotype and find out specifically about your industry and your existing user base. You should use any and all analytics available to learn about your audience's platform preferences.</p>
<p>For instance, collect and analyze the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytics services, such as Google Analytics for Mobile (<a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/analytics/#?modal_active=none">https://www.google.com/analytics/analytics/#?modal_active=none</a>), Yahoo's Flurry Pulse (<a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry-pulse/">https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry-pulse/</a>), Localytics (<a href="https://www.localytics.com">https://www.localytics.com</a>), and Adobe (<a href="https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/web-analytics/mobile-web-apps-analytics.html">https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/web-analytics/mobile-web-apps-analytics.html</a>)</li>
<li>App store analytics</li>
<li>Mobile website consumption</li>
<li>Desktop website consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>After evaluating these numbers, as well as any other available data you have on your audience, you can determine whether or not they have a bias toward any one platform.</p>
<p>Most people tend to fall into either the iOS camp or the Android camp, which then determines the devices they purchase, which app stores they use, and so on.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What are your technical requirements?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<div><img class="image-border" height="225" src="img/11b50e69-2e6c-4c28-8dca-6ccba6128553.png" width="503"/></div>
<p>Not every app is an island. In some cases, apps are required to integrate with other platform-specific services or apps. In such cases, you are presented with firm restrictions that could limit your development options. At a minimum, it will help you get your development priorities straight.</p>
<p>As we'll see next, cross-platform toolkits exist that allow you to release across multiple platforms. Though these tools open up certain courses of action, they restrict others and may hinder compatibility with other native apps. Depending on your technical requirements and integration needs, this particular problem could trump all other issues completely.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What are your technical capabilities?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Sometimes, it's not critical to choose one operating system over the other. When your team's strengths lie in one platform, be practical and choose based on what you can do. After all, developing on an unfamiliar platform has risks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased time to market</li>
<li>Higher technical costs</li>
<li>Higher risks of rework through bugs or other errors</li>
</ul>
<p>The impact of these problems can delay valid data collection and learning.</p>
<p>Developing on a platform that you already know has corresponding benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower technical costs</li>
<li>Lower risks of mistakes</li>
<li>Decreased time to market</li>
<li>Decreased learning cycle time.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are always exceptions to the rule, however. For example, if you have an energetic team with a track record of success, and they want to learn a specific platform, it may be wise to let them run with it. This is a judgment call. Only consider this if you have a team of veterans who know how to build according to best practices.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Native versus hybrid - the strengths and weaknesses</h1>
                
            
            
                
<div><img class="image-border" height="282" src="img/c458bf32-a999-4c63-8795-289ec977a97b.png" width="585"/></div>
<p>Now that we have covered the baseline requirements in terms of your audience, your technical requirements, and your technical capabilities, it's time to see how native and hybrid compare. Though most developers will be familiar with the basic differences between the two, it's important to examine the strengths and weaknesses of each. After that, we will be one step closer to determining the approach that best meets your needs. First, here is a brief overview:</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Native apps</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Native</strong> apps are developed specifically for one platform. In the mobile world, this usually means iOS or Android. The big selling point for native is that platform-specific apps make API calls directly to the OS, giving developers and designers much more flexibility and control over the user experience.</p>
<p>Going native gives you a full range of device features, but you have to pay the price. Native apps are more costly to create and require in-depth expertise... especially if you have to do native development on two different platforms.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Hybrid apps</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Hybrid</strong> apps are part native and part web. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to define the web portion of the app, which is executed via the device's rendering engine, usually Webkit. Mostly, these parts of the app are restricted to UI elements.</p>
<p>The advantage of hybrid apps over mobile web apps is that a hybrid app is still able to make native API calls. Hybrid apps fall on a spectrum between strictly web apps and native apps. They can be nothing more than web apps delivered in a native wrapper. Or they can also include native code in order to take advantage of OS-specific functions.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Pros and cons of going native</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Purists maintain the "all native all the time" philosophy, though this attitude has softened in recent years. All businesses have limited resources, however, so it's impossible to ignore some of the downsides to going native:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native apps are more costly to build and maintain</li>
<li>They take longer to create, which can be a problem if you need to launch soon</li>
<li>Their development requires more expertise, which, again, can be more costly and time-consuming</li>
<li>If you or your team doesn't have the requisite experience, you will have to get it</li>
</ul>
<p>Another potential concern for going native is the possibility that an idea developed for one platform could be copied to the other. The threat of someone attempting to steal your ideas is always a risk, but bear in mind that novel ideas will always be copied. In <a href="0f723563-efd8-45cf-81e7-273b0d9b07ab.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 19</a>, <em>Building an Unfair Advantage</em> we will look at ways to protect your IP from such possibilities.</p>
<p>Despite the downsides and potential risks, there are definite upsides to creating native apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native apps are platform and OS specific, so you will be able to directly take advantage of different levels of APIs, from the GUI toolkit to the filesystem</li>
<li>Finer control over the app and its interface to the device gives you a better handle over app details that can impact the user experience, such as loading time or other subtle UI elements</li>
<li>Integration with certain platform-specific apps or services is only possible when you build a native app</li>
</ul>
<p>These considerations in and of themselves should demonstrate that the choice between native and hybrid is not always so clear cut.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you really have no choice and there is nothing to debate about. If integration requirements force you to develop a platform-specific solution, for instance, the question will never arise. When you can afford to debate, however, it's important to take a user-centric approach to the issue, which is where native apps really shine.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The biggest benefits of going native</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Native apps offer finer control over the user experience. When viewing apps through the lens of Lean, it's vital to put the user experience front and center. Since smartphones have become ubiquitous, consumers have been demanding more and more of their mobile apps. Today, that experience often drives an app's success or failure. Since the early 2010s, study after study has shown that customers will quickly drop apps or sites that underperform:</p>
<ul>
<li>In late 2012, Equation Research surveyed over 3,000 mobile device users. 84% said that mobile app performance was at least somewhat important, and more than 50% felt that mobile apps should load in 2 seconds or less.</li>
<li>According to a frequently cited pair of surveys performed by Gomez.com and Akamai in 2011, a 1-second delay in page loading time can cause a 7% decrease in sales. They also found that 40% abandon a web page that loads in 3 seconds or more.</li>
<li>In July 2016, building on the results of the preceding pair of surveys, Think with Google assessed metrics from a large number of real-world e-commerce sites to create machine learning models that can analyze sites and predict conversion rates and bounce rates. The results were unsurprising: page complexity decreased conversion rates, and slow load times increased bounce rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Performance is only one factor that contributes to the overall user experience. It's possible to develop apps with attractive user interfaces, but the biggest complaint about cross-platform apps is that they don't have a truly native look and feel. However, hybrid apps have their own set of advantages that make them worth exploring.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Pros and cons of going hybrid</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Hybrid apps fall on a spectrum between pure web app and pure native app, and bring advantages from each domain. As with native apps, there is no right or wrong--it's just a matter of determining which is appropriate for your situation. Hybrid apps may not have the same performance or graphics potential as native, but they offer benefits of a different sort:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write once, run anywhere. Cross-platform tools (which we'll cover next), translate code, such as JavaScript or C#, into native language for multiple platforms. Even a simple native shell wrapped around some web code will allow you to list your app in both stores and gain access to both audiences.</li>
<li>Since you can develop a portion of the app as a single codebase, your overhead is much lower.</li>
<li>Shorter development time not only results in lower development costs, it also means your app can be released more quickly.</li>
<li>Hybrid apps, because they have a native component, can be listed in app stores, so you'll get the same exposure you would from developing a native app.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all these upsides, it's easy to see why many developers are taking a softer approach to hybrid, but apps created with cross-platform development tools do have their own set of drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since you won't have as much control over performance, hybrid apps can perform poorly, which can impact the user experience and user satisfaction.</li>
<li>Certain interface elements are difficult or impossible to reproduce with a cross-platform development tool.</li>
<li>Apps have a particular look and feel on each platform, and unless you take great care to mimic that, users will sense the difference.</li>
<li>As mentioned, integration with other native apps or services can be difficult, or impossible.</li>
<li>And, finally, as app complexity increases, it is likely that even a hybrid developer will need to have some degree of native-specific capabilities to effectively troubleshoot certain native issues when they arise.</li>
</ul>
<p>All things considered, there are a few practical realities that convince some developers to choose hybrid.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The ugly truth - a little hybrid doesn't hurt when you have clear goals</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Purists may not like this section, but the bottom line is that we're here to build great apps on whatever budget and timeframe we have. Though nativists may evangelize one platform or other, or both, that strategy doesn't cut it when you have deadlines and limited funds.</p>
<p>When it comes to creating an MVP, your most important constraint is the minimum, both in terms of viability and lovability. You need to meet a certain threshold in order to validate your hypothesis, win over your users, and learn from your experiences.</p>
<p>You can't do that if an impractical native or nothing mindset flushes your budget down the drain. This type of thinking actually opposes the Lean methodology. Perfectionism and purism can stall an app before launch, rack up costs, and even bomb it completely, all in the time it would take to put an MVP onto the market and start learning.</p>
<p>If you can get your app to market sooner by going hybrid, then you should. Downstream technical debt (which comes from converting your hybrid to pure native) is fine, as long as the debt is paid off before it burdens the app with problems.</p>
<p>If you want to build the best app you possibly can in the shortest amount of time possible, then you need to consider all possibilities, including hybrid. It is worth noting that hybrid apps can and do become successful. Twitter, EverNote, and TripCase are all well-known examples, demonstrating that hybrid can be a completely viable approach even in the long run.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Making the final decision - factors to consider</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Earlier, you came up with answers to baseline questions about your audience, your technical needs, and your technical capabilities. Then, we examined the benefits, drawbacks, and capabilities of both native apps and hybrid apps. We also busted the <em>native or nothing</em> myth, demonstrating that hybrid can offer some very real advantages. Now, it's time to answer specific, practical questions that will help you decide which choice is right for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical needs of app impact</strong>: Are native features critical to your app? If not, take a close look at the benefits you would gain from a hybrid approach, such as decreased time-to-market, savings, and access to multiple platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Speed-to-market requirements</strong>: Do you need to make it to the market in under 6 months? If so, then a native app may be out of the question.</li>
<li><strong>Usability and functionality</strong>: How much does customer experience of the app count? Usability enthusiasts and designers may disagree, but, again, practicality trumps ideology. Native certainly gives you an edge in what can be done, but if you can achieve 80% of the effort for 20% of the cost, keep your mind open.</li>
<li><strong>Resource capabilities and budget</strong>: This budget should include development as well as long-term maintenance and technical debt. Do you have the resources to do the work, and can you afford both iOS and Android developers?</li>
<li><strong>Long-term goals</strong>: Weigh your current needs and resources against your long-term goals. Will you need to go native in the future and rebuild your codebase from scratch? Map out possible courses of action and consider how these long-term and short-term overheads will impact your business goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practical decision-making should win out every time. Stick with the facts of what you need to do without forgetting what you actually can do. It's critical to not fixate on how an app is developed. Instead, focus on what matters--or what would matter--to shareholders, namely, marketplace advantages such as market share, market opportunity, disruption potential, and IP. Concentrate on building great apps and following best practices for usability, design, performance, and security.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Leveraging cross-platform development tools</h1>

<p>There are a variety of cross-platform development tools on the market. In this section, we will quickly scan a few of the most common, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adobe PhoneGap</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Adobe PhoneGap is an open source distribution of Apache Cordova. It is not a framework for app development, but serves to package and release apps that have been built in web technologies such as HTML 5, CSS, and JavaScript. It is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud and offers similar benefits to other hybrid options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a core codebase in client-side web languages, and release it natively on some of the most popular platforms</li>
<li>Developers with no native experience can turn a web app into a native app</li>
<li>There is a wide selection of additional tools that make it easy to preview, build, and download test apps</li>
</ul>
<p>PhoneGap's weaknesses are also in line with other cross-platform tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its performance is not on par with native apps.</li>
<li>The graphics capabilities are wanting, and it doesn't deliver a native look or feel.</li>
<li>As mentioned, PhoneGap is not a framework. Bear in mind that PhoneGap does not translate code into a native language, it just wraps up your app in a native package.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Xamarin</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Xamarin is specifically designed for building C# apps on Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac. The company was acquired by Microsoft in early 2016 and leverages their existing services to make it one of the most competitive cross-development tools. Since a large portion of your app will be built from a common codebase, you will definitely save time and money. However, some code, such as UI and platform-specific features, will need to be written natively, so do not expect to quadruple your efficiency.</p>
<p>Apps can be developed in Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio (its own IDE), and Visual Studio for Mac. According to Microsoft, Xamarin completely supports Android and iOS SDKs--as well as third party controls or tools that are developed for native SDKs--and the platform will continue to stay current with new OS releases.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, there is a free option for students, OSS, and independent developers, with pricier options available for professionals and enterprise clients.</p>

<p>Appcelerator allows you to build an app in JavaScript and run it natively on any device. Its toolbox includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A visual app designer</li>
<li>A framework for building APIs</li>
<li>Mobile analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the other tools mentioned here, it offers direct access to native APIs, but apps are still stuck with certain limitations in terms of performance and graphics. Though Appcelerator is reasonably priced, some developers don't feel that the bugs make it worth the effort.</p>
