    notice that the left and right drag handles are already at the full width of the
    page, even though our image is quite thin. This is due to **iAd Producer** adding
    **padding** to our image. Padding bulks out the area an object takes up by adding
    empty space around it. We can adjust the padding; with the object still selected,
    open the **inspector** pane and expand the **Layout** section. In the **Layout**
    section, we can change **Padding X**, the horizontal (or left and right) padding,

    the width, so try reducing **Padding X** to a smaller value, for example, *75*.

    adjust the height of the gallery to accommodate the dots. Our complete gallery
