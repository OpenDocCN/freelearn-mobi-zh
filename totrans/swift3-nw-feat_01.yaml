- en: Apple's release of Swift was a smashing hit from the very beginning. The language
    generated a lot of hype and it delivered. Of course, with the introduction of
    any new programming language, problems and issues will come along for the ride.
    Apple has carefully cultivated the young language, and has been steadily improving
    its base and introducing new features, support, and compatibility with its long
    mainstay incumbent, **Objective-C**. So, why would Apple open-source the language?
    What is Apple's objective and what does that tell us about the forthcoming release
    of Swift 3?

  zh: 苹果公司发布的 Swift 从一开始就取得了巨大的成功。这种语言产生了大量的炒作，并且它实现了承诺。当然，随着任何新编程语言的引入，问题和问题也会随之而来。苹果公司已经精心培养了这种年轻的语言，并且一直在稳步改进其基础，引入新的功能、支持和与长期主导的
    **Objective-C** 的兼容性。那么，为什么苹果要将语言开源？苹果的目标是什么，这又对我们关于即将发布的 Swift 3 的发布有什么启示？

- en: Swift is a general-purpose language that could and should run on any platform.
    Imagine running Swift on Linux or on the **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) you
    create or need to control. Apple believes that the Swift language is so capable
    that they removed the barriers that tied Swift to running on a Mac, opening endless
    possibilities for platform portability. Apple wants the community to find ways
    to get Swift to run on other platforms. Today, the Swift team is supporting a
    port to Linux. Tomorrow, the Swift team could have official support for a wide
    range of platforms.

    Swift 语言的能力如此之强，以至于他们移除了将 Swift 与在 Mac 上运行绑定的障碍，为平台可移植性打开了无限可能。苹果公司希望社区找到让 Swift
    在其他平台上运行的方法。今天，Swift 团队正在支持 Linux 的移植。明天，Swift 团队可能会对广泛的平台提供官方支持。
- en: In order to make the first two themes possible, the Swift team needs to get
    things right from the beginning with Swift 3\. Unfortunately, this means that
    the new changes in Swift 3 do not work well with previous releases of Swift. The
    Swift 3 release will fix and remove things that were awkward in Swift 2 (and its
    predecessors). Swift 3 also re-imagines how it interacts with Cocoa and Objective-C
    to make the APIs that bridge them feel more *Swifty*.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 为了使前两个主题成为可能，Swift 团队需要在 Swift 3 的开发初期就确保一切正确。不幸的是，这意味着 Swift 3 中的新变化与 Swift
    的先前版本不兼容。Swift 3 将修复和删除 Swift 2（及其前身）中不协调的部分。Swift 3 还重新构想了自己与 Cocoa 和 Objective-C
    的交互方式，使连接它们的 API 感觉更加 *Swift*。

    small incremental changes to large commits or long-term disconnected feature branches.
    The Swift team also encourages, but does not enforce, commit messages that describe
    in detail what your committed code changes include. Code quality is extremely
    important and is emphasized through mandatory code reviews and pull requests to
    ensure at least another set of eyes has reviewed all code changes. Think of it
    this way; your changes will eventually make it into a production environment and
    have the potential to affect millions of developers that use the Swift language.

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter we discussed Apple's goals for Swift 3 and the importance of
    the community's engagement and involvement to the language's development. I also
    showed you where to find the source of official information about new and current
    development on the language. Last, we learned how the community can contribute
    to the development process of Swift as a language. In [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Discovering
    New Territories – Linux at Last!"), *Discovering New Territories – Linux at Last!*
    We go over developing Swift on Linux.
