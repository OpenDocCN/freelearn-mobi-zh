			<p>As an application's code base increases, it becomes harder for developers to maintain existing features and introduce new ones. In this clean architecture book, you'll learn how to identify when and how this problem emerges and how to structure your code to overcome it.</p>
			<p>The book starts by explaining clean architecture principles and Android architecture components and then explores the tools, frameworks, and libraries involved. You'll learn how to structure your application in the Data and Domain layers, the technologies that go in each layer, and the role that each layer plays in keeping your application clean. You'll understand how to arrange the code into these two layers and the components involved in assembling them. Finally, we'll cover the Presentation layer and the patterns that can be applied to have a decoupled and testable code base.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you'll be able to build an application following clean architecture principles and have the knowledge you need to maintain and test the application easily.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for Android developers who want to learn about managing the complexity of their applications and is also highly recommended for intermediate or advanced Android developers looking for a go-to guide for clean architecture and the integration of various Android technologies. New developers familiar with the fundamentals of Android app development will find this book useful, too.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B18320_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Clean Architecture</em>, starts by presenting the evolution of Android apps with regards to how business logic was structured, and the problems caused by these approaches. It will then transition to how certain patterns were applied to tackle these issues, revealing other sets of issues. Finally, the concept of clean architecture will be introduce, as well as how its principles can be used to solve some of the problems presented previously.</p>
			<p><a href="B18320_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deep Diving into Data Sources</em>, covers what Android tools and frameworks are available to use with regard to the implementation of the data layer and details and expands on the ones that will be used later in the book, such as Kotlin flows and coroutines, Retrofit, Room, and DataStore.</p>
			<p><a href="B18320_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor055"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding Data Presentation on Android</em>, covers what Android tools and frameworks are available to use with regard to the implementation of the presentation layer and will detail and expand on the ones that will be used later in the book, such as Android ViewModel and Jetpack Compose.</p>
			<p><a href="B18320_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Dependencies in Android Applications</em>, provides a quick overview of dependency injection and how it works. It briefly explores some of the dependency injection tools available for Android development, ending with the Hilt dependency injection framework, about which it goes into a more detailed explanation because it will be used in many of the exercises in the book.</p>
			<p><a href="B18320_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor070"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Building the Domain of an Android Application</em>, describes how to build a domain layer and what components are part of this layer. You will learn about entities and use cases or interactors and what roles they play when it comes to designing the architecture of your application.</p>
			<p><a href="B18320_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor076"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Assembling a Repository</em>, covers the Data layer and the responsibilities this layer has when it comes to managing an application's data, and how it can use the Repository pattern to achieve this.</p>
			<p><a href="B18320_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Building Data Sources</em>, continues the exploration into the Data layer and some examples of data sources that can be defined in Android. You will learn about using remote data sources to load data from various servers as well as local data sources such as Room and DataStore.</p>
			<p><a href="B18320_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor090"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing an MVVM Architecture</em>, presents the MVVM architecture pattern and how it can be used in an application's presentation layer. You will learn how to use the Android ViewModel and LiveData to build an app with MVVM and integrate use cases into the ViewModel.</p>
			<p><a href="B18320_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor098"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing an MVI Architecture</em>, presents the MVI architecture pattern and how it can be used in an application's presentation layer. You will learn how to use Kotlin flows and Android ViewModel to implement the MVI pattern.</p>
			<p><a href="B18320_10_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Putting It All Together</em>, covers the benefits of clean architecture by analyzing an example of an application that implements the concepts and then adding instrumentation tests with Espresso and Jetpack Compose. The introduction of UI tests serves as a good example of how we can inject and change certain behaviors in the application for testing purposes without needing to modify the application's code.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>You'll need the Android Studio IDE installed on your computer (version Arctic Fox 2020.3.1 Patch 3 or above) and Java 8 to be installed. Using later versions of Java such as Java 11 might cause errors when building some of the exercises. Knowing how to trigger builds on an emulator or device and Gradle Synchronizations from Android Studio is recommended before attempting the exercises presented in the book.</p>
			<p><img src="img/B18320_Preface_Table.png" alt=""/></p>
			<p>You can expand on the final exercise of the book by optimizing the way the data is loaded, introducing in-memory caches, or integrating new network calls to fetch additional data for the users. You can also improve the instrumentation testing by adding interaction with the list of data and opening new screens and asserting that the correct data is displayed.</p>
