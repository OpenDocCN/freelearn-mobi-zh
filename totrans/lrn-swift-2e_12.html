Swift is not a small topic and app development itself is orders of magnitude bigger than that. We learned most of Swift but it would not have been practical to cover every little feature of the language and Swift is still a new and evolving language. You are never going to be able to keep everything you've learned in your memory without being able to refer to it later. You can always refer back to this book but Apple's documentation can be a great reference too. Beyond that, if you truly want to become a proficient Swift developer, you can ensure your success by always learning and evolving. It is extremely hard to do that in a vacuum. The best way to ensure that you are keeping up with the times is to follow and participate in the community around whatever topics interest you the most. In this chapter, we will go over how to use Apple's documentation and some suggestions on where you can find and participate in the Swift, iOS, and OS X developer community. More specifically, in this chapter we will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Apple's documentation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Forums and blogs</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Prominent figures</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Podcasts</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Apple's documentation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec87"/>Apple's documentation</h1></div></div></div><p>Apple puts a lot<a class="indexterm" id="id560"/> of time and effort into maintaining its documentation. This documentation can often be a very valuable tool to determine how you are expected to interact with their frameworks.</p><p>Xcode actually integrates with the documentation quite well. One of the main ways you can look at the documentation is within the <span class="strong"><strong>Quick Help</strong></span> inspector. You can display it by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> |<span class="strong"><strong> Utilities</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Show Quick Help Inspector</strong></span> from the main menu. This inspector shows you the documentation of whatever piece of code you currently have your cursor on. If<a class="indexterm" id="id561"/> that particular class, method, or function is a part of Apple's frameworks, you will get some quick help with regards to it, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Apple's documentation" src="graphics/B05103_12_01.jpg"/></div><p>Here the cursor is on <code class="literal">UICollectionView</code>, so the <span class="strong"><strong>Quick Help</strong></span> inspector gives us the high-level information about it.</p><p>You can also look at the documentation in its own window if you need more information or want to do more exploring. You can open up this window at any time by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Documentation and API Reference</strong></span> and you can search for any topic you want. However, you can also jump right to a specific piece of code's documentation by holding the <span class="emphasis"><em>Option</em></span> key and double-clicking on it. For example, if you were to hold the <span class="emphasis"><em>Option</em></span> key and double-click on <code class="literal">isSourceTypeAvailable</code>, you would get the following full documentation window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Apple's documentation" src="graphics/B05103_12_02.jpg"/></div><p>This window acts very similar to the Web. You can navigate through the documentation by clicking on any of the links or searching for a completely unrelated topic. You can also jump to specific parts of a documentation page using the outline view on the left-hand side of the screen.</p><p>This documentation<a class="indexterm" id="id562"/> is particularly useful when you already have a sense of what parts of the framework you need to use for a particular task. You can then use this documentation to figure out the specifics of how to properly use that part of the framework. As you get better acquainted with Apple's frameworks, this will become more useful, because it is relatively easy to remember what parts of the framework you use for all of the common tasks, but it is far more difficult and often impractical to remember exactly how they work. However, sometimes the documentation is not enough. The next place you should look for answers is online.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Forums and blogs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec88"/>Forums and blogs</h1></div></div></div><p>Whenever you <a class="indexterm" id="id563"/>have a problem or question while programming, odds are almost guaranteed that someone else has already run into it and the odds are also very good that someone has already written about it somewhere. Before you jump right to asking a question on a forum, I strongly recommend that you do your own searching. First of all, you want to save the valuable time of the community members. If they are constantly answering the same questions over and over again, they are dedicating a lot less time to truly new questions. Second, you will often find that you discover the answer for yourself in the process of formulating your thoughts, on how to search for it. Lastly, you will become much<a class="indexterm" id="id564"/> better at searching for programming related problems as you practice it more. Forums are usually going to be very slow compared to finding your own answer and obviously time is money.</p><p>Most of the time when you use a search engine to look up a problem; you will find two main types of resources with answers: blog posts and forums.</p><div class="section" title="Blog posts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec119"/>Blog posts</h2></div></div></div><p>Similar to <a class="indexterm" id="id565"/>books, blog posts are fantastic for larger, higher-level considerations. You may search for something, such as: "ways to permanently store information," and you will probably find many blog posts talking about the different ways you can do that. Blog posts are generally better for this because they can discuss the nuances of different solutions and they aren't restricted to target a small problem.</p><p>Blog posts can also be great for extremely in-depth and nuanced problems. For example, there are some major and complicated repercussions of our move from 32-bit to 64-bit processors. Truly understanding the underlying problem will be far more valuable for you in moving forward than finding a quick solution for your immediate problem; if you can't find a book, blog posts are ideal to give you that kind of understanding.</p></div><div class="section" title="Forums"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec120"/>Forums</h2></div></div></div><p>Forms are<a class="indexterm" id="id566"/> incredible at giving you very quick solutions to very specific problems. The most common forums are probably <a class="ulink" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://forums.developer.apple.com">forums.developer.apple.com</a>. On sites like these, there are very <a class="indexterm" id="id567"/>dedicated communities of people answering and asking questions. The Apple developer forum even has Apple employees answering questions. Asking good questions is just as important as answering questions well. These sites act not only as a way to get an answer to a new question but as living documentation for people searching for an answer in the future. A well-framed question is going to be more easily answered and more easily found by a search engine.</p><p>Stack Overflow has a great documentation on what makes good questions and answers, but generally they should have the following characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Be specific and clear about what you are asking for.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Make it easy for other people to reproduce the problem on their own systems.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Be respectful of any answerer's time by putting as much effort as you can into the question up front.</li></ul></div><p>The last point is the most important one. You want to phrase your questions to allow someone with more knowledge than you to hone in on the exact problem instead of wasting time on things you could figure out on your own. This will often mean describing all of the things you have tried already and what roadblocks you hit. The clearer you make it that you have put real effort into solving the problem yourself, the better reception you will get from the community and also better answers. I cannot even count all the times that I have figured <a class="indexterm" id="id568"/>out the solution to a problem while I was writing up a question on a forum. This type of solution is going to be far more memorable and long lasting than a solution that someone else gives you.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Prominent figures"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec89"/>Prominent figures</h1></div></div></div><p>The <a class="indexterm" id="id569"/>more experienced you get at programming with a specific language and/or framework, the more likely you are to get stuck in a pattern of solving problems the same ways over and over again. Odds are that other people have figured out better ways to solve the same problem and someone, somewhere, is talking about it. You have to at least observe the community, even if you are not participating in it yourself.</p><p>One of the best ways to follow the community is to follow the prominent figures in it. For example, for Swift, it is a great idea to follow Chris Lattner, the original creator of Swift. While numerous people now develop Swift, he spent more than a year as the sole developer and continues to run the Developer Tools department at Apple. You can follow him on Twitter <code class="literal">@clattner_llvm</code> and it can also be useful to follow his activity on Apple's Developer forums at <a class="ulink" href="https://devforums.apple.com/people/ChrisLattner">https://devforums.apple.com/people/ChrisLattner</a>. You can click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Email Updates</strong></span> button to get emails about his activity.</p><p>Other than Chris Lattner, there are many other valuable people to pay attention to but only you can decide who is valuable to you. Pay attention to the names you are seeing a lot within the community and find out if they have blogs, podcasts, or any other places you can keep up with what they are saying.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Podcasts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec90"/>Podcasts</h1></div></div></div><p>If you are <a class="indexterm" id="id570"/>not familiar with podcasts, they are an incredibly valuable way of keeping up with virtually any topic in a relatively passive manner. They are essentially on-demand radio shows that you can subscribe to. You can listen to them whenever you want like when driving, doing housework, or working out. That is why they are particularly valuable: they can turn relatively dull situations into fantastic learning opportunities.</p><p>Apple has a podcast app built right into iOS that you can use or there are also numerous other podcast apps on the app store that I recommend you check out. Most of these apps include discovery mechanisms that make it easier to find new podcasts and many podcasts will also talk about other podcasts they recommend.</p><p>It is hard to <a class="indexterm" id="id571"/>recommend specific podcasts because most development podcasts do not last particularly long. It takes a lot of time and energy to produce a podcast, so many people do it for a while and take long breaks or decide to stop after a while. However, because of the on-demand nature of podcasts, it can still be very valuable to go back and listen to old episodes of podcasts. Three podcasts that are great to get you started are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Core intuition</strong></span>: Great <a class="indexterm" id="id572"/>podcast from prominent developers Daniel Jalkut and Manton Reece about general development topics.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Accidental tech podcast</strong></span>: General, Apple oriented tech discussion from big names in<a class="indexterm" id="id573"/> the industry including Marco Arment: a very inspirational developer for me.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Under the radar</strong></span>: A nice <a class="indexterm" id="id574"/>and concise podcast that is always 30 minutes or less but often contains valuable nuggets of information centered around independent Apple development. It is hosted by Marco Arment and David Smith, another inspirational developer.</li></ul></div><p>Some podcasts are so valuable and entertaining that you will want to listen to every episode. Others are great for picking and choosing episodes that seem interesting and relevant to you. Whatever you do, I recommend you don't miss out on this free and easy opportunity to keep up with the development community.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec91"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>The short length of this chapter is in stark contrast to its importance. If there is one thing I could leave you with after reading this book, it is that the best developers know how to seek out and find solutions for themselves from the many sources available to us. Sometimes those solutions are in books like this one; other times they are in documentation, blog posts, forums, podcasts, or even conversations with other people. The developer that can not only find these solutions, but also integrate and truly understand them is going to be incredibly valuable for the rest of their career. However, if you feel overwhelmed at the beginning, do not fret because we all started there. Focus your energy on one problem at a time and don't settle for a solution that just seems to work. Make sure that you understand every solution you put in place and you will quickly, without even realizing it, become an incredibly proficient developer.</p></div></body></html>
