Swift is the gateway for developers to create the next big game on the Apple ecosystem. We have only started to explore the wonderful potential of mobile gaming and Swift is the modernization we need for our toolset. Swift is fast, safe, current, and attractive to developers coming from other languages. Whether you are new to the Apple world, or a seasoned veteran of <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Objective-C</strong></span>, I think you will enjoy making games with Swift.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>Apple's website states, "Swift is a successor to the C and Objective-C languages."</p></div></div><p>My goal in this book is to guide you step-by-step through the creation of a 2D game for iPhones and iPads. We will start with installing the necessary software, work through each layer of game development, and ultimately publish our new game to the App Store.</p><p>We will also have some fun along the way! We aim to create an endless flyer game featuring a magnificent flying penguin named <span class="strong"><strong>Pierre</strong></span>. What is an endless flyer? Picture hit games like iCopter, Flappy Bird, Whale Trail, Jetpack Joyride, and many more – the list is quite long.</p><p>Endless flyer games are popular on the App Store and the genre necessitates that we cover many reusable components of 2D game design; I will show you how to modify our mechanics to create many different game styles. My hope is that our demo project will serve as a template for your own creative works. Before you know it, you will be publishing your own game ideas using the techniques we explore together.</p><p>The topics in this chapter include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Why you will love Swift</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What you will learn in this book</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up your development environment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating your first Swift game</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Why you will love Swift"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Why you will love Swift</h1></div></div></div><p>Swift, as a <a id="id2" class="indexterm"/>modern programming language, benefits from the collective experience of the programming community; it combines the best parts of other languages and avoids poor design decisions. Here are a few of my favorite Swift features.</p><div class="section" title="Beautiful syntax"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Beautiful syntax</h2></div></div></div><p>Swift's syntax <a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>is modern and approachable, regardless of your existing programming experience. Apple balanced syntax with structure to make Swift concise and readable.</p></div><div class="section" title="Interoperability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>Interoperability</h2></div></div></div><p>Swift can<a id="id4" class="indexterm"/> plug directly into your existing projects and run side-by-side with your Objective-C code.</p></div><div class="section" title="Strong typing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Strong typing</h2></div></div></div><p>Swift is a<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/> strongly typed language. This means the compiler will catch more bugs at compile time – instead of when your users are playing your game! The compiler will expect your variables to be of a certain type (<code class="literal">int</code>, <code class="literal">string</code>, and so on) and will throw a compile-time error if you try to assign a value of a different type. While this may seem rigid if you are coming from a weakly typed language, the added structure results in safer, more reliable code.</p></div><div class="section" title="Smart type inference"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>Smart type inference</h2></div></div></div><p>To<a id="id6" class="indexterm"/> make things easier, <span class="strong"><strong>type inference</strong></span> will automatically detect the types of your variables and constants based upon their initial value. You do not need to explicitly declare a type for your variables. Swift is smart enough to infer variable types in most expressions.</p></div><div class="section" title="Automatic memory management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"/>Automatic memory management</h2></div></div></div><p>As the<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/> Apple Swift developer guide states, "memory <a id="id8" class="indexterm"/>management just works in Swift." Swift uses a method called <span class="strong"><strong>Automatic Reference Counting</strong></span> (you will see it referred to as <span class="strong"><strong>ARC</strong></span>) to manage your game's memory usage. Besides a few edge cases, you can rely on Swift to safely clean up and turn off the lights.</p></div><div class="section" title="An even playing field"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13"/>An even playing field</h2></div></div></div><p>One of my <a id="id9" class="indexterm"/>favorite things about Swift is how quickly the language is gaining mainstream adoption. We are all learning and growing together and there is a tremendous opportunity to break new ground.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Are there any downsides to Swift?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>Are there any downsides to Swift?</h1></div></div></div><p>Swift is a <a id="id10" class="indexterm"/>very enjoyable language, but we should consider these two issues when starting a new project.</p><div class="section" title="Less resources"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14"/>Less resources</h2></div></div></div><p>Given<a id="id11" class="indexterm"/> Swift's age, it is certainly more difficult to find answers to common questions through Internet searches. Objective-C has many years' worth of discussion and answers on helpful forums like Stack Overflow. This issue improves every day as the Swift community continues to develop.</p></div><div class="section" title="Operating system compatibility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15"/>Operating system compatibility</h2></div></div></div><p>Swift<a id="id12" class="indexterm"/> projects will run on iOS7 and higher, and OSX 10.9 and higher. Swift is the wrong choice if, in a rare case, you need to target a device running an older operating system.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Prerequisites"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Prerequisites</h1></div></div></div><p>I will strive to <a id="id13" class="indexterm"/>make this text easy to comprehend for all skill levels:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">I will assume you are brand new to Swift as a language</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">This book requires no prior game development experience, though it will help</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">I will assume you have a fundamental understanding of common programming concepts</li></ul></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you will learn in this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>What you will learn in this book</h1></div></div></div><p>By the end of this book, you will be capable of creating and publishing your own iOS games. You will know how to combine the techniques we learn to create your own style of game and you will be well prepared to dive into more advanced topics with a solid foundation in 2D game design.</p><div class="section" title="Embracing SpriteKit"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"/>Embracing SpriteKit</h2></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>SpriteKit</strong></span> is <a id="id14" class="indexterm"/>Apple's 2D game development framework and your main tool for iOS game design. SpriteKit will handle the mechanics of our graphics rendering, physics, and sound playback. As far as game development frameworks go, SpriteKit is a terrific choice. It is built and supported by Apple and thus integrates perfectly with Xcode and iOS. You will learn to be highly proficient with SpriteKit – we will use it exclusively in our demo game.</p><p>We will learn to use SpriteKit to power the mechanics of our game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Animate our player, enemies, and power-ups</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Paint and move side scrolling environments</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Play sounds and music</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Apply physics-like gravity and impulses for movement</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Handle collisions between game objects</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Reacting to player input"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"/>Reacting to player input</h2></div></div></div><p>The control schemes<a id="id15" class="indexterm"/> in mobile games must be inventive. Mobile hardware forces us to simulate traditional controller inputs, such as directional pads and multiple buttons on the screen. This takes up valuable visible area and provides less precision and feedback than with physical devices. Many games operate with only a single input method; a single tap anywhere on the screen. We will learn how to make the best of mobile input and explore new forms of control by sensing device motion and tilt.</p></div><div class="section" title="Structuring your game code"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18"/>Structuring your game code</h2></div></div></div><p>It is important<a id="id16" class="indexterm"/> to write well-structured code that is easy to re-use and modify as your game design inevitably changes. You will often find mechanical improvements as you develop and test your games and you will thank yourself for a clean working environment. Though there are many ways to approach this topic, we will explore some best practices to build an organized system.</p></div><div class="section" title="Building UI/menus/levels"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec19"/>Building UI/menus/levels</h2></div></div></div><p>We will <a id="id17" class="indexterm"/>learn<a id="id18" class="indexterm"/> to switch between scenes in our game with a menu screen. We <a id="id19" class="indexterm"/>will cover the basics of user experience design and menu layout as we build our demo game.</p></div><div class="section" title="Integrating with Game Center"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec20"/>Integrating with Game Center</h2></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Game Center</strong></span><a id="id20" class="indexterm"/> is Apple's built in social gaming network. Your game can tie into<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/> Game Center to store and share high scores and achievements. We will learn how to register for Game Center, tie it into our code, and create a fun achievement system.</p></div><div class="section" title="Maximizing fun"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec21"/>Maximizing fun</h2></div></div></div><p>If you are like me, you will <a id="id22" class="indexterm"/>have dozens of ideas for games floating around your head. Ideas come easily but designing fun gameplay is difficult! It is common to find your ideas need gameplay enhancements once you see your design in action. We will look at how to avoid dead-ends and see your project through to the finish line. Plus, I will share my tips and tricks to ensure your game will bring joy to your players.</p></div><div class="section" title="Crossing the finish line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec22"/>Crossing the finish line</h2></div></div></div><a id="id23" class="indexterm"/><p>Creating a game is a memory you will treasure. Sharing your hard work will only sweeten the satisfaction. Once our game is polished and ready for public consumption, we will navigate the App Store submission process together. You will finish feeling confident in your ability to create games with Swift and bring them to market in the App Store.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Further research"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec12"/>Further research</h1></div></div></div><p>I will focus on the mechanics and programming involved in great game design for iOS.

<div class="section" title="Setting up your development environment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec13"/>Setting up your development environment</h1></div></div></div><p>Learning <a id="id26" class="indexterm"/>a new development environment can be a roadblock. Luckily, Apple provides some excellent tools for iOS developers. We will start our journey by installing Xcode.</p><div class="section" title="Introducing Xcode"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec25"/>Introducing Xcode</h2></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Xcode</strong></span> is <a id="id27" class="indexterm"/>Apple's <a id="id28" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IDE</strong></span>). You <a id="id29" class="indexterm"/>will need Xcode to create your game projects, write and debug your code, and build your project for the App Store. Xcode also comes bundled with an iOS simulator to test your game on virtualized iPhones and iPads on your computer.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>Apple praises Xcode as "an incredibly productive environment for building amazing apps for Mac, iPhone, and iPad."</p></div></div><p>To install <a id="id30" class="indexterm"/>Xcode, search for <code class="literal">xcode</code> in the App Store or visit <a class="ulink" href="http://developer.apple.com">http://developer.apple.com</a> and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Xcode</strong></span> icon. Please note the version of Xcode you are installing. At the time of writing, the current version of Xcode is 6.3.2. Swift is continually evolving and each new Xcode release brings syntax changes to Swift. For the best experience with the code in this book, use Xcode 6.3.x (with Swift version 1.2).</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"/>Note</h3><p>Apple announced Xcode 7 and Swift 2 at WWDC 2015, but it is still in Beta at the time of writing. It looks like there will be some minor syntax changes. The knowledge and techniques in this book will still apply.</p></div></div><p>Xcode performs common IDE features to help you write better, faster code. If you have used IDEs in the past, then you are probably familiar with auto-completion, live error highlighting, running and debugging a project, and using a project manager pane to create and organize your files. However, any new program can seem overwhelming at first. We will walk through some common interface functions over the next few pages. I have also found tutorial videos on YouTube to be particularly helpful if you are stuck.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating our first Swift game"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec14"/>Creating our first Swift game</h1></div></div></div><p>Do you have <a id="id31" class="indexterm"/>Xcode installed? Let's cut to the chase and see some game code in action in the simulator!</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">We will need to create a new project. Launch Xcode and navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Project</strong></span>. You will see a screen asking you to select a template for your new project. Select <span class="strong"><strong>iOS</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Application</strong></span> in the left pane, and <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span> in the right pane. It <a id="id32" class="indexterm"/>should look like this:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Image_B04532_01_01.jpg" alt="Creating our first Swift game"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Once you select <span class="strong"><strong>Game</strong></span>, click <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span>. The following screen asks us to enter some basic information about our project. Do not worry; we are almost at the fun bit. For our demo game, we will create a side-scrolling endless flyer featuring an astonishing flying penguin named Pierre. I am going to name this game <code class="literal">Pierre Penguin Escapes the Antarctic</code>, but feel free to name your project whatever you like. For now, the names are not important. You will want to pick a meaningful <span class="strong"><strong>Product Name</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Organization Identifier</strong></span> when you create your own game for publication. By convention, your <span class="strong"><strong>Organization Identifier</strong></span> should follow a reverse domain name style.

Save your new project. Pick a location on your computer and click <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span>. And we are in! Xcode has prepopulated our project with a basic SpriteKit template.</li></ol></div><div class="section" title="Navigating our project"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec26"/>Navigating our project</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that we have <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>created our project, you will see the project navigator on the left-hand side of Xcode. You will use the project navigator to add, remove, and rename files and generally organize your project. You might notice that Xcode has created quite a few files in our new project. We will take it slow; do not feel pressure to know what each file does yet, but feel free to explore them if you are curious:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Image_B04532_01_03.jpg" alt="Navigating our project"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Exploring the SpriteKit Demo"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec27"/>Exploring the SpriteKit Demo</h2></div></div></div><p>Use the project navigator to<a id="id35" class="indexterm"/> open up the file named <code class="literal">GameScene.swift</code>. Xcode created <code class="literal">GameScene.swift</code> to store the default scene of our new game.</p><p>What is a scene? SpriteKit uses the concept of scenes to encapsulate each unique area of a game. Think of the scenes in a movie; we will create a scene for the main menu, a scene for the game over screen, a scene for each level in our game, and so on. If you are on the main menu of a game and you tap "play", you move from the menu scene to the level 1 scene.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>SpriteKit prepends its class names with the letters "SK"; consequently, the scene class is <a id="id36" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>SKScene</strong></span>.</p></div></div><p>You will see there is already some code in this scene. The SpriteKit project template comes with a very small demo. Let's take a quick look at this demo code and use it to test the iOS simulator.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"/>Note</h3><p>Please do not be concerned with understanding the demo code at this point. Your focus should be on learning the development environment.</p></div></div><p>Look for the run toolbar at the top of the Xcode window. It should look something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Image_B04532_01_04.jpg" alt="Exploring the SpriteKit Demo"/></div><p>Select the iOS device of your preference to simulate using the dropdown on the far right. Which iOS device should you simulate? You are free to use the device of your choice. I will be using an<a id="id37" class="indexterm"/> iPhone 6 for the screenshots in this book, so choose <span class="strong"><strong>iPhone 6</strong></span> if you want your results to match my images perfectly.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"/>Note</h3><p>Unfortunately, expect your game to play poorly in the simulator. SpriteKit suffers poor FPS in the iOS simulator. Once our game becomes relatively complex, we will see our FPS drop, even on high-end computers. The simulator will get you through, but it is best if you can plug in a physical device to test.</p></div></div><p>It is time for our first glimpse of SpriteKit in action! Press the gray play arrow (handy run keyboard shortcut: <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>r</em></span>). Xcode will build the project and launch the simulator. The simulator starts in a new window, so make sure you bring it to the front. You should see a gray background with chalky white text: <span class="strong"><strong>Hello, World</strong></span>. Click around on the gray background. </p><p>You will see spinning fighter jets spawning wherever you click:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Image_B04532_01_05.jpg" alt="Exploring the SpriteKit Demo"/><div class="caption"><p>I may have gone slightly overboard with the jets . . .</p></div></div><p>If you have made it this far, congratulations! You have successfully installed and configured everything you need to make your first Swift game.</p><p>Once you have <a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>spawned a sufficient number of jets, you can close the simulator down and return to Xcode. Note: you can use the keyboard command <span class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>q</em></span> to exit the simulator or press the stop button inside Xcode. If you use the stop button, the simulator will remain open and launch your next build faster.</p></div><div class="section" title="Examining the demo code"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec28"/>Examining the demo code</h2></div></div></div><p>Let's quickly explore<a id="id39" class="indexterm"/> the demo code. Do not worry about understanding everything just yet; we will cover each element in depth later. At this point, I am hoping you will acclimatize to the development environment and pick up a few things along the way. If you are stuck, keep going! Things will actually get simpler in the next chapter, after we clear away the SpriteKit demo and start on our own game.</p><p>Make sure you have <code class="literal">GameScene.swift</code> open in Xcode.</p><p>The <code class="literal">GameScene</code> class implements three functions. Let's examine these functions. Feel free to read the code inside each function, but I do not expect you to understand the specific code just yet.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">The game invokes the <a id="id40" class="indexterm"/><code class="literal">didMoveToView</code> function whenever it switches to the <code class="literal">GameScene</code>. You can think of it a bit like an initialize, or main, function for the scene. The SpriteKit demo uses it to draw the <span class="strong"><strong>Hello World</strong></span> text to the screen.</li><li class="listitem">The <a id="id41" class="indexterm"/><code class="literal">touchesBegan</code> function handles the user's touch input to the iOS device screen. The SpriteKit demo uses this function to spawn the fighter jet graphic and set it spinning wherever we touch the screen.</li><li class="listitem">The <a id="id42" class="indexterm"/><code class="literal">update</code> function runs once for every frame drawn to the screen. The SpriteKit demo does not use this function, but we may have reason to implement it later.</li></ol></div></div><div class="section" title="Cleaning up"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec29"/>Cleaning up</h2></div></div></div><p>I hope that you have <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>absorbed some Swift syntax and gained an overview of Swift and SpriteKit. It is time to make room for our own game; let us clear all of that demo code out! We want to keep a little bit of the boilerplate, but we can delete most of what is inside the functions. To be clear, I do not expect you to understand this code yet. This is simply a necessary step towards the start of our journey! Please remove lines from your <code class="literal">GameScene.swift</code> file until it looks like the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">import SpriteKit
