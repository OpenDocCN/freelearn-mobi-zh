    learned was how to use operators. These include basic operators like assignment
    and arithmetic operators, which were covered in *Chapter 3*, *Learning about Variables,
    Constants, Strings, and Operators*. It wasn't until much later, when I learned
    how to program in the C language, that I learned about advanced operators such
    as bitwise operators. While the advanced operators are not as popular as the basic
    operators, they can be very powerful when used correctly. Advanced operators are
    especially useful if you are planning on writing applications that use low-level
    C-based libraries.

- en: In this code, we begin by defining two points and then adding them together
    using the addition operator that we created. The results of this operator are
    put in the new `combined` instance of the `MyPoint` type. The `combined` instance
    will contain the values of `x` as 6 and `y` as 14.

- en: We then use the addition assignment operator that we created to add the values
    in the `firstPoint` instance to the values in the `combined` instance. The result
    of this operation is put in the combined instance of the `MyPoint` type. The `combined`
    instance now contains the values of `x` as 7 and `y` as 14.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we use the inverse operator on the `combined` instance of the `MyPoint`
    type to reverse the values and save the new values in the `inverse` instance of
    the `MyPoint` type. The `inverse` instance contains the values of `x` as -7 and
    `y` as -18.

    custom operators as well. Let's see how we can do this.

    of the standard operators provided by the Swift language. New operators must be
    declared globally using the `operator` keyword. They must also be defined with
    the `infix`, `prefix`, or `postfix` keywords. Once an operator is defined globally,
    we are then able to add it to our types using the operator methods as shown in
    the previous section. Let''s take a look at this by adding two new operators:
    `•`, which we will use to multiply two points together, and `••`, which will be
    used to square a value. We will add these operators to the `MyPoint` type that
    we created in the last section.'

    type together. The results are put in the multiplied instance of the `MyPoint`
    type. The multiplied instance will now contain the values of `x` as 5 and `y`
    as 40\.

    and put the new value in the squared instance. The `squared` instance will now

- en: In this chapter we looked at how we can use the advanced bitwise AND, OR, XOR,
    and NOT operators to manipulate the bits of values stored in variables. We also
    looked at how we can use the left and right shift operators to shift bits to the
    left and right. We then saw how we can use overflow operators to change the default
    behavior for addition, subtraction, and multiplication so errors are not thrown
    if operations return values above the maximum or below the minimum values for
    a type.

    types, which enables us to use the standard operators provided by Swift with our
    custom types. We also saw how we can create our own custom operators as well.
