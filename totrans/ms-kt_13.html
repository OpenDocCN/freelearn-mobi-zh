			<h1 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Publishing Your App</h1>
			<p>Once our remarkable applications have been developed, the subsequent phase involves delivering these apps to our intended audience. This is accomplished by releasing our apps on the Google Play Store. This chapter will focus on the process of <span class="No-Break">doing so.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will learn step-by-step how to publish a new app in the Google Play Store. We will walk through how to create a signed app bundle and things such as answering questions about the content of our app, creating releases, setting up how users will access our app – either via controlled testing tracks or publicly, and much more. All this is required for us to publish our first app to the Play Store. Additionally, we will learn about some of the Google Play Store policies and how to always stay compliant to avoid our apps being removed or our accounts <span class="No-Break">being banned.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Preparing our app <span class="No-Break">for release</span></li>
				<li>Releasing our app to the Google <span class="No-Break">Play Store</span></li>
				<li>Google Play Store <span class="No-Break">policies overview</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow the instructions in this chapter, you will need to have Android Studio Hedgehog or later (<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio"><span class="No-Break">https://developer.android.com/studio</span></a><span class="No-Break">) </span><span class="No-Break">downloaded</span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>You can use the previous chapter’s code to follow the instructions in this chapter. You can find the code for this chapter on <span class="No-Break">GitHub (</span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Kotlin-for-Android/tree/main/chapterthirteen"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Kotlin-for-Android/tree/main/chapterthirteen</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Preparing our app for release</h1>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Before we upload our app to the Google Play Store, we have to do several things to prepare it for release. I have a <strong class="bold">checklist</strong> that I go <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>through every time I release an app. We will be going through the<a id="_idIndexMarker641"/> checklist in this section. The checklist helps ensure that we do not forget anything as we release our app and that the app is functional. We will be tackling some of the checklist items later, in <a href="B19779_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor215"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></span></a> of this book, but they are worth <span class="No-Break">mentioning here.</span></p>
			<p>Here is <span class="No-Break">the checklist:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Add analytics to <span class="No-Break">your app</span></li>
				<li>Add crash reporting to <span class="No-Break">your app</span></li>
				<li>Turn off logging <span class="No-Break">and debugging</span></li>
				<li>Internationalize and localize <span class="No-Break">your app</span></li>
				<li>Improve <span class="No-Break">error messages</span></li>
				<li>Test your app on <span class="No-Break">different devices</span></li>
				<li>Provide proper <span class="No-Break">feedback channels</span></li>
				<li>Reduce the size of <span class="No-Break">your app</span></li>
				<li>Use Android <span class="No-Break">App Bundle</span></li>
				<li>Enable minification <span class="No-Break">and obfuscation</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let us learn about each of these items in <span class="No-Break">greater detail.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>Add analytics to your app</h2>
			<p>Adding <strong class="bold">analytics</strong> to an app helps in getting metrics on how the app is performing once it is released. This helps in<a id="_idIndexMarker642"/> making decisions on how to improve the app. Platforms such as<a id="_idIndexMarker643"/> Firebase Analytics, Google Analytics, Flurry, and Mixpanel offer such services. We are going to add Firebase Analytics to our app in <a href="B19779_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor215"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></span></a> of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>Add crash reporting to your app</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Crash reporting</strong> libraries help us get crash reports for our apps. This helps in fixing the bugs that cause crashes. This is very helpful in <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>catching crashes and stack traces when users are using our apps. We are<a id="_idIndexMarker645"/> going to add Firebase Crashlytics to our app as our crash reporting library in <a href="B19779_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor215"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></span></a> of this book. There are other crash-reporting tools that can be used, such as Sentry, Bugsnag, and Raygun. It’s always good to weigh which tool works best you our <span class="No-Break">use case.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Turn off logging and debugging</h2>
			<p>To ensure that we do not expose <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>any sensitive information about our app to other users, we have<a id="_idIndexMarker647"/> to ensure that our release builds do not have <strong class="bold">logs</strong> or <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">debugging</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> enabled.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Internationalize and localize your app</h2>
			<p>If an app targets different<a id="_idIndexMarker648"/> countries, we have to ensure that we localize and internationalize the app. This means that we have to translate the app to the languages of the countries that <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>we are targeting. Through internationalization, a well-structured code base enables seamless integration of accessibility features and supports diverse languages. Unicode support ensures compatibility with characters from various languages, enhancing accessibility. Localization adapts content, language, and cultural nuances, making our app more accessible to users with language-related needs. Adapting date, time, and numerical formats, as well as visual elements, contributes to both the accessibility and usability of our app. We have to ensure that apps work well in the different countries that we <span class="No-Break">are targeting.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Improve error messages</h2>
			<p>As we release our app, we have to ensure<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> that we display <strong class="bold">error messages</strong> in a way that is easy for our users to <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>understand. We have to avoid displaying error messages that are meant for developers. With analytics in place, we can always log the technical details of errors and be able to know what is causing <span class="No-Break">the errors.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Test your app on different devices</h2>
			<p>This is a very important <a id="_idIndexMarker652"/>checklist item. Since end users normally don’t have the same devices and operating systems, it is important that we test the app on different devices. This helps us ensure that our app works well on different devices, including different screen sizes and different operating systems. We can always leverage services such as Firebase Test Lab to test apps on different devices. Firebase Test Lab (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab">https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab</a>) provides a variety of physical and virtual devices that we can use to <span class="No-Break">test apps.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Provide proper feedback channels</h2>
			<p>At times, even with all these checklist items done, users might run into unexpected issues that we might not have anticipated. We have to ensure that we provide proper <strong class="bold">feedback channels</strong> for our users to<a id="_idIndexMarker653"/> reach out to us. This helps in ensuring that we get feedback from users and are able to fix any issues that they might be facing. This also makes users feel that we care about them and we are ready to help them. The feedback channels can be via email, social media, a phone number, or any other channel that we can use to respond <span class="No-Break">to users.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>Reduce the size of your app</h2>
			<p>We have to ensure that <a id="_idIndexMarker654"/>our app is not too big, reducing the size as much as possible. This helps in ensuring that our app is downloaded and installed faster. We do this by removing any unused resources from our app. We can also compress any audio or images that are bundled with our app. For images, we can strive to use vector images as much as possible. These are very small in size and scale well on different <span class="No-Break">screen sizes.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Use the Android App Bundle</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Android App Bundle</strong> (<strong class="bold">AAB</strong>) is a<a id="_idIndexMarker655"/> publishing format that includes all the compiled code and resources of an app but defers <a id="_idIndexMarker656"/><strong class="bold">Android Package Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">APK</strong>) generation and signing to Google Play. This helps in reducing the size of the app. With Android App Bundle, we benefit from a smaller app, are able to deliver some features on demand, and can deliver instant app experiences to <span class="No-Break">our users.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Android Studio</strong> provides a way to<a id="_idIndexMarker657"/> create a signed Android App Bundle. Android requires all AABs to be signed with a certificate before they can be uploaded to the Google Play Store. Signing a <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>bundle allows for size optimization and dynamic delivery, and simplifies the app <span class="No-Break">signing process.</span></p>
			<p>To create a signed Android App Bundle, we have to navigate to <strong class="bold">Build</strong> | <strong class="bold">Generate Signed Bundle or APK</strong>, as <span class="No-Break">shown here:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer187" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19779_13_01.jpg" alt="Figure 13.1 – Generate a signed bundle" width="680" height="316"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.1 – Generate a signed bundle</p>
			<p>As seen in the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker659"/>screenshot, AAB offers a variety of benefits as we have already discussed. Click <strong class="bold">Next</strong> to continue with <span class="No-Break">the process:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer188" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19779_13_02.jpg" alt="Figure 13.2 – Selecting your keystore certificate" width="854" height="385"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.2 – Selecting your keystore certificate</p>
			<p>In this step, we choose to<a id="_idIndexMarker660"/> either create a keystore certificate or use an<a id="_idIndexMarker661"/> existing one. Click <strong class="bold">Create new...</strong> to create a new keystore certificate. Then, you will be presented with the following <span class="No-Break">dialog box:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer189" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19779_13_03.jpg" alt="Figure 13.3 – Creating a new keystore certificate" width="560" height="463"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.3 – Creating a new keystore certificate</p>
			<p>In this dialog box, we<a id="_idIndexMarker662"/> fill in the details of the keystore certificate. Ensure that you use a password that you can remember and store it in a place where you can<a id="_idIndexMarker663"/> always access it. This is because subsequent releases will need to be signed with the <span class="No-Break">same certificate.</span></p>
			<p>Also, ensure to save it with the <strong class="source-inline">.jks</strong> extension. Once done filling in the form, click <strong class="bold">OK</strong> to save the certificate. This brings you back to the dialog shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 13</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> but with certificate details filled in now. Click <strong class="bold">Next</strong> to continue with the process. You will be presented with the <span class="No-Break">following dialog:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer190" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19779_13_04.jpg" alt="Figure 13.4 – Selecting the build variant" width="851" height="270"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.4 – Selecting the build variant</p>
			<p>Here, we are going to select the build variant that we want to sign. We are going to select the <strong class="bold">release</strong> build <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>variant. Click <strong class="bold">Create</strong> to create the signed Android <a id="_idIndexMarker665"/>App Bundle. Gradle will build the signed Android App Bundle. Once the process is done, you will be presented with the <span class="No-Break">following notification:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer191" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19779_13_05.jpg" alt="Figure 13.5 – Signed bundle generated notification" width="324" height="138"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.5 – Signed bundle generated notification</p>
			<p>You can either choose <strong class="bold">analyze</strong> to analyze the bundle or <strong class="bold">locate</strong> to locate the folder the bundle is located in. We are going to use this bundle later on when we upload our app to the Google <span class="No-Break">Play Store.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Enable minification and obfuscation</h2>
			<p>Minification and obfuscation <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>help in reducing the size of an app. Minification removes any unused code in the app. Obfuscation helps in making code unreadable. Minification involves reducing the size of the code base by removing unnecessary characters and renaming variables, leading to smaller APK sizes and improved app performance. Obfuscation, on the other hand, focuses on renaming classes, methods, and fields to obscure their original names, enhancing the security of the app and protecting against reverse engineering. Together, these techniques contribute to smaller, faster, and more secure Android applications by optimizing the code size and making it hard for hackers to reverse engineer the app. We do this for <span class="No-Break">release builds.</span></p>
			<p>Let us head over to our app-level <strong class="source-inline">build.gradle.kts</strong> file and modify the <strong class="source-inline">buildTypes</strong> block as <span class="No-Break">shown here:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
buildTypes {
    release {
        isMinifyEnabled = true
        isShrinkResources = true
        setProguardFiles(
            listOf(
                getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android.txt"),
                "proguard-rules.pro"
            )
        )
    }
    debug {
        isMinifyEnabled = false
        isShrinkResources = false
    }
}</pre>			<p>We have enabled minification and obfuscation for our release build. We have also disabled minification and obfuscation for our debug build. This is because we want to be able to debug our app when we are developing it. After doing this, it is recommended to run the release build locally <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>before we upload it to the Google <span class="No-Break">Play Store.</span></p>
			<p>This is because some of the code might be removed when we enable minification and obfuscation. This might cause our app to crash. We have to check and see if we need to add rules on how our code <span class="No-Break">is obfuscated.</span></p>
			<p>We do this by adding rules in the <strong class="source-inline">proguard-rules.pro</strong> file. For example, for Retrofit to still do serialization of our JSON responses, we have to ensure that our model classes are <span class="No-Break">not obfuscated.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let us navigate to the <strong class="source-inline">proguard-rules.pro</strong> file and add the <span class="No-Break">following rules:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
-keep class com.packt.chapterthirteen.data.Cat.** { *; }
-keep class com.packt.chapterthirteen.data.CatEntity.** { *; }
# With R8 full mode generic signatures are stripped for classes that are not
# kept. Suspend functions are wrapped in continuations where the type rgument
# is used.
-keep,allowobfuscation,allowshrinking class kotlin.coroutines.Continuation
-keep,allowobfuscation,allowshrinking interface retrofit2.Call
-keep,allowobfuscation,allowshrinking class retrofit2.Response</pre>			<p>With these rules in place, when our code is shrunk, the classes that we have specified will not be obfuscated. Since our app is not that big, we do not have a lot of rules. For large apps, ensure you test thoroughly and check your dependencies documentation for any rules that you need <span class="No-Break">to add.</span></p>
			<p>On the <strong class="bold">Build Variants</strong> tab, select the <strong class="bold">release</strong> build variant and run a release build as <span class="No-Break">shown here:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer192" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19779_13_06.jpg" alt="Figure 13.6 – Release build variant" width="388" height="87"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.6 – Release build variant</p>
			<p>After choosing the<a id="_idIndexMarker668"/> release build variant, we need to set up the key signing certificate that we created earlier on so that our release variant can run. To do so, let us add the following in our app-level <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">build.gradle.kts</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> file:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
signingConfigs {
    create("release") {
        storeFile = file("../keystore/packt.jks")
        storePassword = "android"
        keyAlias = "packt"
        keyPassword = "android"
    }
}</pre>			<p>In the preceding code, we have created a new config in our <strong class="source-inline">signingConfigs</strong> block called <strong class="source-inline">release</strong>. We have specified <strong class="source-inline">keyAlias</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">keyPassword</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">storeFile</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">storePassword</strong>. The keystore file is in the root directory of this project, as seen in the code snippet. If you saved it in a different location, be sure to change <span class="No-Break">the path.</span></p>
			<p>Click the <strong class="bold">Sync Now</strong> button to sync the project. Next, we need to add this new <strong class="source-inline">signingConfig</strong> to our release build type. To do so, let us add the following to our release <span class="No-Break">build type:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")</pre>			<p>Now we can run the release build locally. However, the release build takes longer to build than the <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>debug build. After the app runs, we should be able to see our cute cat images in <span class="No-Break">the app:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer193" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19779_13_07.jpg" alt="Figure 13.7 – Viewing cute cat images in the app" width="489" height="1053"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.7 – Viewing cute cat images in the app</p>
			<p>Our checklist is complete and we already have a signed AAB. In the next section, we will upload our app to the Google <span class="No-Break">Play Store.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Releasing our app to the Google Play Store</h1>
			<p>Before you can publish apps to the Google Play Store, you<a id="_idIndexMarker670"/> need to have a developer <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>account. You can get one by signing up on Google <span class="No-Break">Play (</span><a href="https://play.google.com/console/signup"><span class="No-Break">https://play.google.com/console/signup</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>You can either create an account for yourself or your organization as <span class="No-Break">shown here:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.9 – Creating a developer account for yourself</p>
			<p>As shown in the preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker672"/> screenshot, you need an email address where users can reach out to you and another one where Google Play can reach out to you. You<a id="_idIndexMarker673"/> also need to pay a lifetime registration fee of USD 25 for the Google Play account. If you don’t have an account, you can proceed with the purchase as it is a very <span class="No-Break">straightforward process.</span></p>
			<p>Once you open a Google Play Console account, you will be presented with the <span class="No-Break">following screen:</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>An overview of Google Play Store policies</h1>
			<p>Google Play policies are part of our releases. As such, we developers must be aware of most of them, if not all. This is because if we violate any of the policies, our app could be removed from the Google Play Store. We also need to be aware of them since some of them influence how we develop <span class="No-Break">our </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker720"/></span><span class="No-Break">apps.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we will look at some of the policies we need to be aware of as we develop <span class="No-Break">our apps:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Background location access</strong>: Apps are restricted from accessing the user’s location in the background unless they are delivering a high-quality, beneficial user experience. This is to ensure that apps do not drain the battery of the user’s device. If your app needs to access location in the background, you must provide a compelling reason why it needs to access location in the background. You also must provide a privacy policy that explains how you are using the location data that you <span class="No-Break">are collecting.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data safety</strong>: With newer Android versions, there has been an emphasis on data safety. As mentioned, when filling out the <strong class="bold">Data safety</strong> section, we must ensure our app complies with the policies. We must provide privacy policies, terms, and conditions and share with our users how we use <span class="No-Break">their data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Financial apps</strong>: Different countries have different rules for financial apps. We must ensure we are aware of the rules of the country we are targeting. Some countries provide licenses and Google Play requires us to upload these licenses as proof of compliance. If we are developing a financial app, we must ensure we are compliant and have the <span class="No-Break">necessary licenses.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Restricted content</strong>: Google Play has several types of restricted content. We must check that our app does not have any <span class="No-Break">restricted content.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Intellectual property</strong>: We must ensure our app does not infringe on any intellectual property. We must ensure we have the necessary rights to use any content in <span class="No-Break">our app.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use of SMS or call log permission groups</strong>: Apps that use SMS or call log permission groups are required to be approved by Google Play. This is to ensure that apps do not misuse the permissions. If our app uses any of these permissions, we <a id="_idIndexMarker721"/>must submit a permission <span class="No-Break">declaration form.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Health content and services</strong>: Google Play does now allow apps that expose users to harmful health-related content. We must ensure our app does not expose users to <span class="No-Break">such content.</span></li>
			</ul>

This page provides an extensive overview of the policies with in-depth examples of violations.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we have learned step-by-step how to publish a new app in the Google Play Store. We walked through how to create a signed app bundle and the things required for us to publish our first app to the Google Play Store. Additionally, we learned about some of the Google Play Store policies and how to always stay compliant to avoid our apps being removed or accounts <span class="No-Break">being banned.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to use GitHub Actions to automate some manual tasks such as deploying new builds to the Play Store. We will learn how to run tests on <strong class="bold">Continous Integration and Continous Delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) pipelines and push builds to the Google Play Store using <span class="No-Break">GitHub Actions.</span></p>
