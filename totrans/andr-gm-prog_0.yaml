    entertain, and educate the planet. Android uses one of the most popular programming
    languages—Java, which is a high-performance, secure, and object-oriented language.

    time using on their phones. Video games have never been easier to make and distribute.
    Who would not want to make games for Android? And on top of this, making games
    is fun, addictive, and very rewarding; it can be hard to stop once you get started.

    to implement a feature, or perhaps integrate it into our game. This course will
    help you build simple as well as complex games from scratch using the Android
    SDK and all your queries and obstacles will be addressed in this journey.

- en: '[Module 1](pt01.html "Part 1. Module 1"), *Learning Java by Building Android
    Games*, starts off with the Java fundamentals and their use in an Android environment
    to make a simple math quiz game. You will be building your very own Android UI
    using easy to-use tools in Android Studio. You will learn to add real-time interaction
    with Java threads and implement locking/handling screen rotation, pixel graphics,
    clicks, animation, sound FX, and many other features in your games. It also covers
    the advanced OOP concepts for building and deploying a graphical pong-style game.
    This module ends with exploring different APIs and implement advanced features
    such as online leaderboards and achievements using Google game services'

- en: '[Module 2](pt02.html "Part 2. Module 2"), *Android Game Programming by Example*,
    is a whirlwind tour of as many Android 2D gaming features that can possibly be
    squeezed into 11 chapters. Every line of the code used to build three games of
    increasing difficulty is shown in the text of this module and explained in a straightforward
    manner. It is steadily built up to implement a flexible and advanced game engine
    that uses OpenGL ES 2 for fast smooth frame rates. This is achieved by starting
    with a simple game and gradually increasing the complexity of the three complete
    games built step by step. You will implementing cool features like sprite sheet
    character animation and scrolling parallax backgrounds and be designing and implementing
    genuinely challenging and playable platform game levels. You will then learn to
    code both basic and advanced collision detection and make the math behind 2D rotation,
    velocity, and collision simple. Later on you will learn how to run your game designs
    at 60 frames per second or better and also process multi-touch screen input. By
    the end of this module, you will be implementing a multitude of other game features
    like pickups, firing weapons, HUDs, generating and playing sound FX, scenery,
    level transition, high scores, and more.'

    will help you build a real-time game from scratch using the Android SDK. This
    module will make you understand the internals of a game engine and each of its
    components. You will learn to decide when to use each of the different ways of
    drawing on Android. Moving forward, you will learn to handle user inputs, from
    virtual joysticks to gamepads, collision detection using different techniques
    and discover how to optimize it for complex games. You will also learn about animations
    and particle system and how to implement it in your game before you finally move
    on to tackle the challenges faced while making it available on Google play for
    Android TV.'
