    internet first arose for public use, people relied on personal computers to browse
    websites. However, the iPhone made web browsing possible on a mobile device.

    until you get home to use a bulky computer. Instead, you can visit websites on
    your iPhone and do everything from online shopping and watching videos to reading
    news and responding to blog posts.

    screen compared to the larger screen of desktop or laptop computers, the principles
    remain the same: load a browser and visit a website. The difference is just learning
    how to type and view websites on the smaller screen and virtual keyboard of the
    iPhone.'
