- en: Augmented reality applications have moved from novelty to reality, and with
    the release of ARKit and now ARCore, have become more accessible to the average
    developer. Now virtually anyone with a grasp of a programming language can quickly
    build an AR experience using a variety of platforms. Google, with the release
    of ARCore, has now made this even easier and also provides support for multiple
    development platforms. This book will guide you through building AR applications
    using JavaScript and web in mobile with Java/Android and also in mobile with C#
    / Unity. Along the way, you will learn the fundamentals of building a quality
    AR experience for your user.

    reality app with ARCore, but has no background in game or graphic programming.
    Although the book only assumes the reader has basic high-school level math, the
    reader should still have a firm grasp of at least one of the following programming
    languages: JavaScript, Java, or C#.'

    covers the fundamental concepts any modern AR app needs to tackle in order to
    provide a great experience to the user. We will learn the basic concepts of motion
    tracking, environmental understanding, and light estimation.'

    web server with Node.js. Then, this chapter looks through the various sample ARCore
    templates and discusses how to extend those for further development.'

    the web examples to add a real-world motion tracking. Not only will this showcase
    several fundamentals of working with 3D concepts, but it will also demonstrate
    how ARCore tracks a user''s motion.'

    the user''s environment. We will grasp how ARCore identifies planes or surfaces
    in the environment and meshes them for user interaction and visualization. Here,
    we will take a look at how to modify a shader in order to measure and colorize
    the points from the user.'

    We learn how ARCore provides for the estimation of light and how it is used to
    light the virtual models placed by the user into the AR world.'

    to the success of the AR revolution. We then look to building a simple neural
    network that learns through supervised training using a technique called back
    propagation. After learning the basics of NN and deep learning, we look to a more
    complex example that demonstrates various forms of Machine Learning.'

    user to place virtual furniture in the living space or wherever they need to.
    We also cover how to place and move an object in AR using touch and how to identify
    when an object is selected. Then, we will extend our lighting and shadows from
    [Chapter 7](edd56812-fcba-4f66-aa3e-e9cf9ee7b637.xhtml), *Light Estimation* and
    provide real-time shadows on the virtual objects.'

    Reality*,is where we introduce mixed reality through the use of inexpensive MR
    headsets. ARCore is ideally suited for use in these inexpensive headsets since
    it already tracks the user and monitors their environment internally. We will
    oversee how to turn our app from a traditional mapping app using the 3D `WRLD`
    API for Unity to an AR mapping app, where we will also provide an option to switch
    to MR and an MR headset.'

    of performance and the impact it can have to the various systems. After that,
    we cover general debugging and troubleshooting tips, where we finish off with
    a table that covers the most common errors a user may encounter in this book.'
