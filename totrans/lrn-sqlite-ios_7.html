But this has changed, partly because there are so many alternatives, partly because they were losing out on hundreds or thousands of apps to competitors, and partly because of the sheer ease of development compared to that of the past. These were the driving forces behind the change.</p><p>When code is written using PhoneGap with HTML5, you can deploy it on a certain target or platform, such as iOS or Android, or many versions are created by default, for the Apple App Store or the Android store, among others. This is the benefit of using a single code base, a newer and easier language such as HTML5, and a cross-platform development tool such as PhoneGap.</p><p>In this chapter, we will look at how to use Xcode with PhoneGap to integrate and compile with source code including HTML5. We will show you how to write code using SQLite and SQL statements and enter code directly into HTML5, which is then preprocessed by PhoneGap. We will cover all the aspects of creating a default Apple Xcode application from start to finish using the SQLite database for data storage, and using PhoneGap and HTML5 as a start.</p><div class="section" title="HTML5 and PhoneGap development"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec57"/>HTML5 and PhoneGap development</h1></div></div></div><p>Because it is easier to <a class="indexterm" id="id295"/>develop mobile and tablet apps using <a class="indexterm" id="id296"/>HTML5, PhoneGap, and generally, cross-development tools, there seems to be software snobbery, where some people think that HTML5 development is somewhat not as skilled as native development. There have been some very bad native developments built so far, but the same could apply to HTML5 or other mobile apps on the app stores.</p><p>Using these modern cross-development tools is a good and quick way if you want to build prototypes from designs that give and show the look and feel, and show some functionality too. Cross-browser technology will not perform as quickly or efficiently as a native app and, as mentioned, it has a reputation for not being as real as native apps. With the growth of mobile technology, there has been a high growth of HTML5 apps available, because they are much faster to design, develop, and produce, compared to native apps.</p><p>There are pitfalls for those web developers who think that they can just put an app together for mobiles to produce something comparable to a desktop. Well, they are wrong. Anyone who builds a mobile app for iOS, for example, must read their human guidelines document, which will outline how to actually take into consideration the user experience, the way to design buttons and journeys, and how best to build something that fits in the iOS ecosystem. Google/Android has fewer checks, but as their app store grows, I am sure there will be more or different types of controls enforced.</p><p>Web developers must<a class="indexterm" id="id297"/> understand the limitations of their<a class="indexterm" id="id298"/> destination devices for these apps. Mobiles, including smartphones, actually don't have the processing power of a desktop, and web developers must be aware of how programming principles can be applied within these types of developments.</p><p>It is great to try new software technology; if you have an idea, then try to create, test it, and submit your app to the App Store. But if you take some person and get them to try to create a native app, they have to learn a whole new language and way of doing things. It's going to take a lot longer until they are even able to produce a working mobile app, but by that time they will have quite a bit of experience. There are applications that have a mixed mode of native code, combined with cross-development code such as HTML5. In practice, although these work, there are huge pitfalls in performance and they are limited as well.</p><p>There are advantages to building and using native apps and applications for specific mobile devices or operating systems, which are usually installed on your phone via an app store. These benefits include speed of development, the same app across the product range, one set of code, and a change queue for the app. Native is the best way to code ideally, but if you have web skills and you don't want to learn a new programming language, and you want to create an HTML5 app, using PhoneGap delivered on iOS, Android, or Windows may be an alternate way of using your skills.</p><p>With advances in HTML5 and PhoneGap API options, there are many new functions, including those of camera manipulation, for example, which can be done via some basic commands. With a good designer, a decent app using HTML5 can be made quite quickly and economically.</p><p>Mobile developers need to be educated on performance deliverables to build apps, which are skills they can use again and again. The benefits will be used on all the apps they produce.</p><p>The advantages of a mobile app surpass the straightforward usage of a mobile website. Some advantages are listed here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A variety of programming languages such as Swift, Objective-C (iOS), Java (Android), or C# (Windows Phone) can be used to deliver the end app, for example</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">All the "controls" and the API are native in design and development, and are interrogated and approved by the app stores from Apple, Google, or Windows</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The other benefit of using native is that there is no reliance on any outside technology for it to work, and there is the possibility of working offline if required</li></ul></div><p>The mobile web <a class="indexterm" id="id299"/>application by definition would have less <a class="indexterm" id="id300"/>access to the low-level functionalities of a device and system calls. Due to enhanced development of the APIs and higher-level languages such as HTML5, CSS, or JavaScript, this is changing through software updates and upgrades. By using the mobile web/app solutions for mobile sites, app store approval is not required, and by ensuring proper code design, the same application can work with a variety of devices and device sizes, and different mobile or desktop operating systems or browsers. Information is served to the app, and there are no offline facilities, unlike native.</p><p>HTML5 is praised as easy, unlike the native facilities offered by native code.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="An HTML5 framework"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec58"/>An HTML5 framework</h1></div></div></div><p>Functionality, like memory allocation and usage, animations, and a variety of other options, will define what a good <a class="indexterm" id="id301"/>HTML5 framework is. This framework does offer good access to mobile phone devices, such as the camera, or some other internal information that only a native app could previously access. These factors go far in deciding the type of framework to use.</p><p>Just because some frameworks or JavaScript libraries are popular in one area does not necessarily mean they are not required in another. For example, the jQuery JavaScript framework is very popular due to many programmers having used it in the past for large or small projects.</p><p>It will be difficult for an end user to distinguish native and HTML5 development when the app is running. However, the way it is installed will determine whether it is a web or native app. Not that it matters to the end user, but users expect a great look and feel, richness in technology, easy and quick navigation, and that the app actually solves their issue, which is the functionality of the application in the first place.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Hybrid applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec59"/>Hybrid applications</h1></div></div></div><p>There are some misconceptions about the use of hybrid HTML5 apps. Users think that hybrid applications<a class="indexterm" id="id302"/> cannot store offline data in a database such as SQLite. Hybrid apps can work online and offline. They do not need to be connected all the time for it to work. PhoneGap with HTML5 gives more facilities, functionalities, and options.</p><p>The standard storage mechanism for HTML5 apps is the local storage on the device itself, that is, the database used is SQLite. If you are not connected online, data can be stored locally. Once the database is connected, it will upload data from the local database.</p><p>A common thought is that HTML5 is out of its league when it comes to native. However, today, in-app purchases, Game Centre, executing background tasks, accessing the GPS and the camera, and even Bluetooth, can be accessed via HTML5. PhoneGap is used where a native wrapper is required for an HTML5 app. There are some differences in the way native and hybrid/cross-development apps work, like PhoneGap compared to Objective-C. Hybrid/HTML5 apps are slower, and although the functionality of HTML5 has increased, it does not match native yet.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec60"/>An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we start to do <a class="indexterm" id="id303"/>anything, you have to start by building the<a class="indexterm" id="id304"/> environment and the software tools, and making some <a class="indexterm" id="id305"/>minor configurations to get everything ready. The app itself will be simple, and outline the process of creating an app for PhoneGap and HTML5.</p><p>You need to download the Xcode software to get the project working.</p><p>For Apple users, the Xcode command-line tool, and the <a class="indexterm" id="id306"/>Apache Cordova product can be downloaded from: <a class="ulink" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12</a>.</p><p>To get the command-lines tools for Xcode<a class="indexterm" id="id307"/> and other components, download them from <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action">https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action</a>. You need to be a registered as an Apple developer to be able to download any extra components. A second and easier method for PhoneGap is to just download the software from the site and install it, as opposed to using the older, command-line way.</p><p>The following screenshot shows you Xcode in the iTunes Store:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_01.jpg"/></div><p>The next <a class="indexterm" id="id308"/>screenshot shows the software available for a <a class="indexterm" id="id309"/>developer when you log in through an Apple <a class="indexterm" id="id310"/>Developer account. Only the command-line Xcode tools are required. It also shows you the command-line tools that can be downloaded and installed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_02.jpg"/></div><p>The<a class="indexterm" id="id311"/> next part of the process is to download the Cordova <a class="indexterm" id="id312"/>module of the software, as shown in the software <a class="indexterm" id="id313"/>in the following screenshot. This is the location of the latest Apache/Cordova release. PhoneGap was acquired by Adobe in 2011, and the project itself was donated to the <a class="indexterm" id="id314"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Apache Software Foundation</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>ASF</strong></span>). There are two ways of using PhoneGap. One is its cloud-based service to build apps and the second is the local/manual version to build and package apps the PhoneGap CLI way. We will be using the PhoneGap CLI way in our first setup, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_03.jpg"/></div><p>Download<a class="indexterm" id="id315"/> the Cordova software to the <code class="literal">Downloads</code> <a class="indexterm" id="id316"/>folder, unpack it, and within the <code class="literal">cordova-ios</code> <a class="indexterm" id="id317"/>directory, you'll find all the necessary components to use PhoneGap/Cordova with Xcode to create a simple app. The following screenshot shows the directory structure for the Cordova/PhoneGap system. As you can see, PhoneGap supports a variety of technologies and cross-platforms:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_04.jpg"/></div><p>To proceed, we need to invoke the <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span> app. Initially, on your OS X machine, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Utilities</strong></span>, and then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span> application, as shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_05.jpg"/></div><p>Once you<a class="indexterm" id="id318"/> click on the image, the following window for<a class="indexterm" id="id319"/> the <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span> app can be seen. It will allow you to<a class="indexterm" id="id320"/> carry on with the process of setting up the environment and required components. This is where you can carry out the necessary commands to install it:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_06.jpg"/></div><p>Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> icon on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Utilities</strong></span> folder, then click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span> icon, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_07.jpg"/></div><p>After <a class="indexterm" id="id321"/>selecting <a class="indexterm" id="id322"/>the <a class="indexterm" id="id323"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> icon, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Utilities</strong></span> folder:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_08.jpg"/></div><p>Once<a class="indexterm" id="id324"/> the <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span> window is clicked, the following <a class="indexterm" id="id325"/>window is<a class="indexterm" id="id326"/> displayed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_09.jpg"/></div><p>Once you're in this directory, perform the following commands: the first one is to create a project, and the second one is to create a directory with your app name:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$cd ~/Documents</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>$cordova create hello com.example.helloHelloWorld</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>A package for the <code class="literal">Hello</code> program has now been created using Cordova. Before you start to build any projects, the system needs to know which platforms to target, for example, Android, iOS, or Windows. Cordova now has the iOS platform added to it, as shown in the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ cd hello</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>$ cordova platform add ios</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Once a <a class="indexterm" id="id327"/>platform is added, performing the following<a class="indexterm" id="id328"/> command <a class="indexterm" id="id329"/>will outline the platforms your application can work on:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ cordova platforms ls</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Installed platforms: ios 3.7.0</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Available platforms: amazon-fireos, android, blackberry10, browser, firefoxos</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Within the <code class="literal">Hello</code> application, perform a directory listing with <code class="literal">ls-l</code> and you will see a variety of directories, such as <code class="literal">platforms</code>. Set the <code class="literal">platforms</code> directory as the default. Then perform an <code class="literal">ls-l</code> listing to see a variety of directories, including the <code class="literal">HelloWorld.xcodeproj</code> file.</p><p>Once you open the <code class="literal">Hello.xcodeproj</code> file, Xcode will wake up and you will see the project name. You can enter a company identifier as well. See the following screenshot.</p><p>You will be prompted for a simulator phone to be selected upon execution. Select <span class="strong"><strong>iOS simulator for iPhone 6.0</strong></span>. Next, select the simulator and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Run</strong></span> button to compile, link, build, and execute the simple application. You will be presented with the Cordova image, as shown in the following screenshot, and the <code class="literal">Hello</code> app will then be displayed:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_010.jpg"/></div><p>At this stage, you <a class="indexterm" id="id330"/>have set up an Xcode project with <a class="indexterm" id="id331"/>Cordova or PhoneGap and some basic code. Now it is <a class="indexterm" id="id332"/>time to add some HTML5 code into the mix to show how both aspects of PhoneGap/iOS and SQLite work together.</p><p>In addition to the method used previously to install Cordova, the easiest way is to download and install PhoneGap directly, without going through the command-line method. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Download</strong></span> button on the PhoneGap<a class="indexterm" id="id333"/> download page at <a class="ulink" href="http://phonegap.com/download">http://phonegap.com/download</a>.</p><p>The process may alter for some of its versions, but will usually be the same for most of them. Next, the <code class="literal">.zip</code> file is downloaded, so open it up and extract the files to a directory. Then install the PhoneGap program, which will deliver the interface, and once this step is complete, create an Xcode project, as shown in the following screenshot. Since you have done this before, doing it this way is even easier:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_011.jpg"/></div><p>When you've <a class="indexterm" id="id334"/>performed the preceding task, like with previous<a class="indexterm" id="id335"/> installations, an extra icon for PhoneGap will appear. Since you<a class="indexterm" id="id336"/> have installed the components required for Xcode and PhoneGap to work together, you are now ready to start developing.</p><p>The following screenshot shows how to select the PhoneGap app type:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_012.jpg"/></div><p>When creating a<a class="indexterm" id="id337"/> Cordova application, you must select the<a class="indexterm" id="id338"/> Cordova-based application template, as shown in the<a class="indexterm" id="id339"/> following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_013.jpg"/></div><p>Next, choose the project name for this project—enter <code class="literal">Hello</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_014.jpg"/></div><p>The next field <a class="indexterm" id="id340"/>is for a company identifier ID. Like before, please <a class="indexterm" id="id341"/>add a unique identifier, which is usually <a class="indexterm" id="id342"/>the reverse of the domain name.</p><p>This is a standard way to install the PhoneGap framework with Xcode. In your browser, go to <a class="ulink" href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org/</a> and press the <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span> button to download the JavaScript library<a class="indexterm" id="id343"/> called <code class="literal">node.js</code>. Finally, enter the admin/username and password details to install the software locally:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="An Xcode project with PhoneGap, HTML5, and Swift" src="graphics/4725_07_015.jpg"/></div><p>Your <a class="indexterm" id="id344"/>

Hopefully, it has helped you to perform iOS development with these technologies, and showed you how using PhoneGap/SQLite can enhance how quickly apps can be delivered to the end user.</p><p>It is also a cross-development platform, where the source is created once and delivered to a variety of platforms in a quick-format generation method. HTML5 works with Xcode, Swift, and PhoneGap in a cohesive and quick way.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will talk about future advances, further features, and SQLite functionality. This will be useful in the development process, to get better and more controlled applications. The benefits of using one codebase for multiple platforms is very beneficial to both developers and customers. The next chapter will also be an aid and guide on how these features can be used in new and updated apps in the future.</p></div></body></html>
