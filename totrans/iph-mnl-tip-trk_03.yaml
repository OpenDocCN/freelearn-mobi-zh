    out of the box. However, others like the idea of customizing their iPhone to make
    it more personal. For example, you might want to display a picture of your dog
    in the background or change the sound your iPhone makes every time you get a call
    so that it doesn't sound like everyone else's iPhone.

    or pictures, you can also customize your iPhone to rearrange app icons to make
    it easier to find the apps you use most often. More importantly, you might want
    to modify the privacy settings to protect the security of your personal data.

    remember that any time you change a setting, you can always change it back, so
    feel free to experiment and see how to make your iPhone uniquely your own.

    through your iPhone. This can be a handy way to provide internet access to others,
    but keep in mind that you may be charged extra for data usage and that the internet
    connection may not be fast. That means you probably don't want to use an iPhone

    version since that will offer the most features, along with fixing bugs from previous
