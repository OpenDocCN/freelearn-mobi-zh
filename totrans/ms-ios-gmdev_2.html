However, as you know, we have to start slow! All games have assets, such as a 3D model, an image, or super awesome sound effects. If you don't know anything about stuff like this, then you've come to the right place! In this chapter we are going to discuss:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating or obtaining assets for your game</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating an optimized asset</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Designing your game</li></ul></div><p>This is where you can start to get really creative! Once you start designing the building blocks of your awesome new project, the fun really begins.</p><p>Some assets will be easy to create, some will require a little more effort, some may involve paying people to create them for you, and some may require downloading free assets, as shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03553_02_01.jpg" alt="Creating the Stuff"/></div><p>Enough intro, let's roll!</p><div class="section" title="Let's talk assets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec10"/>Let's talk assets</h1></div></div></div><p>Assets are the <a id="id20" class="indexterm"/>building blocks of your game. They will essentially make up 100 percent of your game, regardless of whether you are creating a 3D blockbuster, or a 2D platformer as we will in this book.</p><p>There are various assets you will either create, purchase, or have created for you for your project. Let's break them down.</p><div class="section" title="Sprites"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec09"/>Sprites</h2></div></div></div><p>What?! Don't worry, not a <a id="id21" class="indexterm"/>watery sprite as in, say, Homer's The Odyssey. When it <a id="id22" class="indexterm"/>comes to video game assets, sprites are essentially images that are used in your game. See that Mario image in the intro of this chapter? That right there is a sprite. Sprites can also be used for special effects, such as 2D lens flares or particles. Sprites are usually created in sprite sheets containing characters and their animations, such as the following image, which is a ripped sprite sheet from one of the many Megaman titles:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03553_02_02.jpg" alt="Sprites"/></div><p>Sprites can be super easy to create, or they can be massively complex and take many hours to draw. Yes, draw. Sprites can be drawn in any imaging software, using just the mouse, or a tablet (I highly recommend purchasing one because it makes sprite creation a heck of a lot easier).</p><p>On the other hand, sprites can be rendered using a 3D animation program. I have used 3D Studio Max for some of my earlier games, and I was very pleased with the results.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Best sprite size</strong></span>: Varies on device, but where a 32x32 px image will look good on a 3GS, it will be impossible to see on a retina iPad.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>File type</strong></span>: PNGs are usually the best file format (in my personal opinion) as they have a great compression (small file sizes = better performance), quality, and they support transparency, which is essential when drawing your characters as you don't want a white box surrounding them!</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Recommended software</strong></span>: I <a id="id23" class="indexterm"/>am partial to Adobe Photoshop, but as I've <a id="id24" class="indexterm"/>mentioned numerous times in my other books, there are a lot of free alternatives to it. A programs such as Gimp is a perfect example.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Sound effects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec10"/>Sound effects</h2></div></div></div><p>BOOM! KABLAMO! PAFF! Well these speech bubbles are not required for games! Sound effects are just as <a id="id25" class="indexterm"/>important as the sprites you create. Now, sound effects can be <a id="id26" class="indexterm"/>tricky to create yourself unless you have professional audio recording equipment. For me, I search for royalty-free sound effects on the Internet. Believe me, there's a plethora of them available for you to use, ranging from cartoon sound effects, to gunshots and explosions. <a class="ulink" href="http://www.freesound.org">www.freesound.org</a> is a great site that I've used many times for my games.</p><div class="section" title="File type"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec01"/>File type</h3></div></div></div><p>The iPhone audio SDK <a id="id27" class="indexterm"/>documentation indicates that iPhone supports audio in several formats, however there are drawbacks to each:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>MP3</strong></span>: This is a highly compressed, but also high-quality encoding format that preserves the richness of music and spoken voice. However, only one single MP3 stream can be played at a time on an iPhone because it requires the use of the hardware decoder. This excludes MP3 as a format for sound effects, since it will interrupt background music and/or any user music being played.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>WAV</strong></span>: iPhone only supports WAV files if they are PCM-encoded and do not require any compression codes. While WAV supports many different sampling rates and bit-depths, it results in very large files (180k/sec for 16-bit/44.1kHz/stereo audio). This large size becomes prohibitive when you have many effects to play rapidly.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>AIFF</strong></span>: This has similar problems to WAV files—Apple Lossless compression is supported.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Custom</strong></span>: You can use iPhone low-level APIs to play your own audio from any source, but this seems like overkill for playing a simple sound effect in a game.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Recommended software</strong></span>: For manipulating sound effects and rewriting/converting them, the best software I've found to date is <span class="strong"><strong>Audacity</strong></span>. It's free, easy to use, and <a id="id28" class="indexterm"/>supports the main audio formats. The following image shows the Audacity logo:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03553_02_03.jpg" alt="File type"/></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Music"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec11"/>Music</h2></div></div></div><p>Another important <a id="id29" class="indexterm"/>asset is music. I love music and wish I could have a song playing at all times in my games. However, I understand in many games music can be used for setting <a id="id30" class="indexterm"/>the mood, and can stir up emotions for the following scene. Creation of music isn't difficult, it just takes a good ear and a little bit of creativity. You can either create your own music, or you can download royalty-free audio. You always want to make sure it's royalty free, or else you could make someone very (legally) angry.</p><div class="section" title="Formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec02"/>Formats</h3></div></div></div><p>As mentioned earlier, the best <a id="id31" class="indexterm"/>format for music is MP3. It allows only one track so it is uninterrupted by other sound effects and provides a high-quality, low file size.</p></div><div class="section" title="Best software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec03"/>Best software</h3></div></div></div><p>Garage band for the <a id="id32" class="indexterm"/>creation, and for any editing, again use Audacity.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Videos"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec12"/>Videos</h2></div></div></div><p>Personally, I love creating <a id="id33" class="indexterm"/>and playing cut scene videos for my games. I feel they provide a good break between game play, but, hey, that's just me. I know many people <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>just skip them as soon as they begin.</p><p>The following image is grabbed <a id="id35" class="indexterm"/>from the intro video of one of my projects called <span class="emphasis"><em>LOST</em></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03553_02_04.jpg" alt="Videos"/></div><div class="section" title="File type"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec04"/>File type</h3></div></div></div><p>M4V (many programs, including <a id="id36" class="indexterm"/>QuickTime, can convert any video to an M4V, but if you want a little more control, use <span class="strong"><strong>Handbrake</strong></span>).</p></div><div class="section" title="Best software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec05"/>Best software</h3></div></div></div><p>I use 3DS Max a lot for my video creations and then I import into <span class="strong"><strong>iMovie</strong></span> for manipulating. If you are <a id="id37" class="indexterm"/>looking for a 2D solution, try Adobe Flash (I believe it used to be called <span class="strong"><strong>FlashMX</strong></span>). For converting the videos use Handbrake, which has a huge array of settings you can change to tweak the video for the desired quality and file size.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating optimized assets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec11"/>Creating optimized assets</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's start with creating <a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>optimized sprites for the best performance. How will this affect performance? Think of a game as a video, and your device as the DVD player, or even your TV. The game plays frame by frame and your device displays each frame. However, it has to render each frame. This happens so fast you will never notice it, but now imagine your device has to render large images (let's think dialup internet loading a huge photo). It can take longer and because the device has to work harder, the battery will drain quicker.</p><p>This is only one reason that can slow performance; we will discuss other reasons further on.</p><p>In the following figure, I've <a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>drawn a character design from my last book, and I drew him in Photoshop:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03553_02_05.jpg" alt="Creating optimized assets"/></div><p>For your information, his name is <span class="strong"><strong>Kevin</strong></span>. It doesn't look like much does it? Here are the details of the drawing:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Image size</strong></span>: 52px x 52px</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Color space</strong></span>: RGB</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Compression</strong></span>: None at the moment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>File type</strong></span>: Unsaved</li></ul></div><p>I went ahead and saved the image in three different file types: bitmap, PNG, and JPEG. In the following figure we see the different file types, beginning with PNG on the left, JPEG in the middle, and bitmap on the right:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03553_02_06.jpg" alt="Creating optimized assets"/></div><p>So what are we looking at here? Let's break it down. We will start with the JPEG, a widely used image format:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>File size</strong></span>: 29KB, quite <a id="id40" class="indexterm"/>miniscule when you consider we now have multi-terabyte hard drives. However, JPEGs do tout the largest file size.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Alpha channel</strong></span>: No, as mentioned before, jpegs do not allow transparency, which is ok if you are just creating a sprite that fills the whole box and has no background, but for our little character here, a JPEG will do us no good.</li></ul></div><p>Other than that, JPEGs are the same as PNG files:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>File size</strong></span>: 9KB, quite a lot smaller then the others, meaning increased performance!</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Alpha channel</strong></span>: Yes! This <a id="id41" class="indexterm"/>guy is a winner here!</li></ul></div><p>Then on to the bitmap:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>File size</strong></span>: 17KB, again very small and in this case the midrange file size</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Alpha channel</strong></span>: Again, no</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Color profile</strong></span>: Non-existent</li></ul></div><p>Essentially bitmaps are basic image files with not much information regarding the actual image.</p><p>Awesome! So it seems that PNGs are the winner! I went a step further to test my theory: I imported these three images into a blank <span class="strong"><strong>SpriteKit</strong></span> project and wanted to see the difference between rendering each image. Want to know my findings? Of course you do! It's all about the science!:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>BMP</strong></span>: Cannot be imported into the <code class="literal">Images.xcassets</code> section the way I did with the other two images, so that's a bummer... But I worked around it. The CPU had a high 16 percent usage, memory had a range of 7.6 to 7.8MB (very similar to the PNG), and the FPS (or frames per second) dipped when the sprite was created at 56FPS, a completely unnoticeable dip.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>JPEG</strong></span>: In Xcode's debugger, simply rendering the sprite file spinning like a top, the CPU seemed to hover around 12 percent usage (I'm using a 16GB iPhone 5S), memory was clocked at 7.9MB, and the FPS remained steady at 60FPS, the best you can get.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>PNG</strong></span>: Again, in the debugger, rendering the PNG image spinning like a top, the CPU fluctuated between 11 percent and 12 percent usage, memory ranged between 7.5 and 7.8MB, a little bit lower then the jpeg but not enough to notice just rendering one image, and the FPS was clocked in at a steady 60FPS.</li></ul></div><p>Here is what the findings will look like:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03553_02_07.jpg" alt="Creating optimized assets"/></div><p>For each file type, I created about 200 images on the screen, all spinning at the same speed, and never saw any hiccups in frame rate, but did see a decent increase in <span class="strong"><strong>CPU</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Memory</strong></span> (an increase of about 5-10 percent).</p><p>All in all, not bad figures. It still <a id="id42" class="indexterm"/>seemed as though the PNG was easier to render than the others, which does make a huge difference when rendering multiple objects or images in memory.</p><div class="section" title="Video conversion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec13"/>Video conversion</h2></div></div></div><p>When you are <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>converting your videos using a third-party program that doesn't have iOS presets, iOS supports the following formats and settings:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>H.264 video</strong></span>: up to 1.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Low-Complexity version of the H.264 Baseline Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48 kHz, stereo audio in <code class="literal">.m4v</code>, <code class="literal">.mp4</code>, and <code class="literal">.mov</code> file formats</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>H.264 video</strong></span>: up to 768 Kbps, 320 by 240 pixels, 30 frames per second, Baseline Profile up to Level 1.3 with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48 kHz, stereo audio in <code class="literal">.m4v</code>, <code class="literal">.mp4</code>, and <code class="literal">.mov</code> file formats</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>MPEG-4 video</strong></span>: up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48 kHz, stereo audio in <code class="literal">.m4v</code>, <code class="literal">.mp4</code>, and <code class="literal">.mov</code> file formats</li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>For more <a id="id44" class="indexterm"/>information, take a look at <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Miscellaneous/Conceptual/iPhoneOSTechOverview/MediaLayer/MediaLayer.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Miscellaneous/Conceptual/iPhoneOSTechOverview/MediaLayer/MediaLayer.html</a>.</p></div></div><p>Remember, the developer <a id="id45" class="indexterm"/>forums and iOS development documentation will be your best friend!</p></div><div class="section" title="Audio conversion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec14"/>Audio conversion</h2></div></div></div><p>There is a fantastic article by <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>Audrey Tam regarding audio <a id="id47" class="indexterm"/>encoding for iOS. Here's a quick excerpt from the article found on <a class="ulink" href="http://raywenderlich.com">raywenderlich.com</a> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/69365/audio-tutorial-ios-file-data-formats-2014-edition">http://www.raywenderlich.com/69365/audio-tutorial-ios-file-data-formats-2014-edition</a>):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>"There are actually just a few (formats) that are the preferred encodings to use. To know which to use, you have to first keep this in mind:</em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>You can play linear PCM, IMA4, and a few other formats that are uncompressed or simply compressed quite quickly and simultaneously with no issues.</em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>For more advanced compression methods such as AAC, MP3, and ALAC, the iPhone does have hardware support to decompress the data quickly—but the problem is it can only handle one file at a time. Therefore, if you play more than one of these encodings at a time, they will be decompressed in the software, which is slow.</em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>So to pick your data format, here are a couple of rules that generally apply:</em></span></p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>If space is not an issue</strong></span>, just encode everything with linear PCM. Not only is this the fastest way for your audio to play, but you can play multiple sounds simultaneously without running into any CPU resource issues.</em></span></p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>If space is an issue</strong></span>, most likely you'll want to use AAC encoding for your background music and IMA4 encoding for your sound effects."</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>If you have a lot of audio files being played throughout your game (who doesn't?), you can save a lot of time and guesswork by importing them into iTunes, then right-clicking on them and selecting create AAC version. iTunes will then create a new AAC version that you can locate and import into your project and it will work 100 percent of the time. No guesswork!</p><p>I know, it can be confusing at times trying to figure out which format to use and how to convert things, but Apple does make things fairly easy by including audio conversion right in iTunes.</p><p>Now let's talk a little <a id="id48" class="indexterm"/>bit about design.</p></div></div>

No doubt you already have an idea for your game, but it's always a great idea to put things down in writing. I tell people this all the time, write it down, or you'll either forget it completely, or certain critical details. I've done it myself, I've had a great idea for a new game when I awake at 2am, but I don't write it down and by the morning I've completely forgotten my great idea. Not only is it good for remembering things, but it's also good for planning and expediting the creation and development process. The game we are going to create in this book will be in the style of <span class="emphasis"><em>Contra</em></span> in the aspect that it will be a platformer, and we will add the ability to allow playing with your friends! But that will come much later in the book. We are also going to go through the planning process together.

It's not that difficult! It's pretty in-depth but not all of it is required. I actually deleted quite a few lines because they weren't applicable to the game we are going to be creating. Now that the game is <a id="id53" class="indexterm"/>essentially planned, there are two other design documents you can make use of. The first is level design sheets, and the second is storyboards.</p><p>Level design sheets provide you with a grid to fill in to create your levels on paper:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03553_02_08.jpg" alt="Game design document"/></div><p>Blank templates are supplied for you in the resource section of this book. I suggest printing them out and putting <a id="id54" class="indexterm"/>them in a binder so you can have a "game design book" as shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03553_02_09.jpg" alt="Game design document"/></div><p>I use storyboards for designing cut scenes that will occur throughout the game. This is not required but, hey, it's still a good thing to have things planned out so the development will run quickly and smoothly.</p><p>I love the planning process! I think we are about ready to blast off and get into some development don't you? Yeah! That will have to wait until the next chapter though, I've rambled enough in this chapter already. There's a lot to take in when it comes to device performance and optimization, and it can be pretty confusing. I'm all self-taught, so I hope you learned something!</p><p>Onwards and upwards, so let's <a id="id55" class="indexterm"/>blast off into the development of our awesome game!</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec14"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter we discussed asset creation, what programs to use, as well as the best formats to use. We then had a great comparison between file type rendering to show which file type is more efficient and easier on the system. We then discussed the design aspect of game development. We took a look at a game design document, as well as level design and storyboard documents. In the next chapter, we begin development!</p></div></body></html>
