            <p>When I first started programming, I was in my mid-twenties. I started a lot older
               than most, but I will say that grasping the basics took me a bit longer than most.
               I remember when I bought my first programming book and I read and reread chapters
               over and over again until the concepts made sense to me. I found that a lot of books
               talked to me like I had majored in computer science. As you progress through this
               book, take your time-and, if you need to go back, it is okay to do so. No one is going
               to care that it took you an extra day to understand a concept. It is more important
               that you fully understand that concept.
            </p>
            
            <p>One tip I would give you is not to copy and paste code. No matter where you find the
               code and no matter how long it takes, it benefits you to type it out. Doing this really
               helped me as I eventually started to remember the code and it became second nature
               to me.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the last chapter, we went over the basics of Swift to get you warmed up. Now, we
               will dig deeper and learn some more programming concepts. These concepts will build
               on what you have already learned. In this chapter, we will cover:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Ranges</li>
               
               <li>Control flow</li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>Let's begin by creating a new Playground project.</p>

            <h1 class="header-title">Creating a Playground project</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>As you learned earlier, launch Xcode and click on <strong>Get started with a playground</strong>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/beb3fd88-173f-45fe-b372-b856ced4f013.png"/></div>
            
            <p>The Playground template screen will appear. Make sure that you select <span class="packt_screen">iOS</span> and then choose <span class="packt_screen">Blank</span> and hit <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>. You will be asked to give your project a name and a location to save the file; name
               your new Playground <kbd>iOS11-Programming-for-Beginners-Ch4</kbd>. You can save the file anywhere you like. Now, with the project saved, we can explore
               Playgrounds a bit.
            </p>
            
            <p>Next, delete everything inside of your file and toggle on the Debug panel using the
               toggle button (<em>cmd</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>Y</em>). You should now have a blank screen with the Results panel on the right and the
               Debug panel on the bottom opened.
            </p>
            
            <p>We focused on the basics earlier and now we will build upon those skills. Ranges are
               one such data type that we should learn and are very useful and can come in handy
               for a variety of reasons. Let's take a look at what Ranges are and then start to understand
               the difference between a <em>closed Range</em>, a <em>half-closed Range,</em> and a <em>one-sided Range</em>.
            </p>

            <p>Ranges are generic data types that represent a sequence of numbers. Let's look at
               the following image to understand:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="22" src="assets/68cf5ed7-5afe-437b-b76d-50d08e0806d0.png" width="224"/></div>
            
            
            
         </article>

      <section>
         
         
         <header>
            
            <h1 class="header-title">Closed range</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Notice that, in the preceding image, we have numbers ranging from <strong>10</strong> to <strong>20</strong>. Rather than having to write each value, we can use Ranges to represent all of these
               numbers in shorthand form. In order to do this, let's remove all of the numbers in
               the image except for <strong>10</strong> and <strong>20</strong>:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="23" src="assets/1bd76f58-907a-431d-9b1a-5494fe77b1fc.png" width="234"/></div>
            
            <p>Now that we have removed those numbers, we need a way to tell Swift that we want to
               include all of the numbers that we just deleted. This is where the range operator
               (...) comes into play. Therefore, in Playgrounds, let's create a constant called range
               and set it equal to <kbd>10...20</kbd>:
            </p>
            <pre>let range = 10...20</pre>
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/8e0c51e4-2d6a-483b-9f88-37eb5f3ce8c0.png"/></div>
            
            <p>The range that we just entered says that we want the numbers between <kbd>10</kbd> and <kbd>20</kbd> as well as both <kbd>10</kbd> and <kbd>20</kbd> themselves. This type of Range is known as a closed Range.
            </p>
            
            <p>Inside of Playground, in the result you will see a Show Result icon:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/6611882e-79f0-4f58-b708-d59e9ca41fa0.png"/></div>
            
            <p>If you hover over the result you will also see Quick Look:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="122" src="assets/a99f3956-e41f-4f84-9e81-0df3b3c5d480.png" width="337"/></div>
            
            <p>Select the Show Result icon so that you can see the result:</p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/a594a9c0-209e-49af-ad06-66f9856aedc7.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Next, we also have what is called a half-closed Range.</p>

            <h1 class="header-title">Half-closed range</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>Let's make another constant that is known as a half-closed Range and set it equal
               to <kbd>10 &lt; 20</kbd>. Add the following into Playgrounds:
            </p>
            <pre>let halfClosedRange = 10..&lt;20</pre>
            <p>Your code should now look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/03d7f2d2-cb7a-428e-b867-a2f5c2870845.png"/></div>
            
            <p>A half-closed Range is the same as a closed Range, except that the end value will
               not be included. In this example, that means that 10 through 19 will be included and
               20 will be excluded.
            </p>
            
            <p>At this point, you will notice that your Results panel shows you <kbd>CountableClosedRange(10...20)</kbd> and <kbd>CountableRange(10..&lt;20)</kbd>. We cannot see all the numbers within the Range. In order to see all the numbers,
               we need to use a loop.
            </p>

            <p>In programming, control flow is the order in which your code is executed. When working
               with Swift, we can use a variety of control statements. Loops, in particular, are
               useful for when you want to repeat a task multiple times. Let's take a look at a few
               different types of loop.

            <h1 class="header-title">The for...in loop</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>One of the most common control statements is a <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop. It allows you to iterate over each element in a sequence. Let's see what a
               <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop looks like:
            </p>
            <pre>for &lt;value&gt; in &lt;sequence&gt; { 
 // Code here 
} </pre>
            <p>We start the <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop with for, which is proceeded by <kbd>&lt;value&gt;</kbd>. This is actually a local constant (only the <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop can access it) and can be any name you like. Typically, you will want to give
               this value an expressive name. Next, we have in, which is followed by <kbd>&lt;sequence&gt;</kbd>. This is where we want to give it our sequence of numbers. Let's write the following
               into Playgrounds:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/da8d9242-c296-4e2f-b0ed-d306dffc8ab2.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Notice that, in our Debug panel, we see all of the numbers we wanted in our range.</p>
            
            <p>Let's do the same for our <kbd>halfClosedRange</kbd> variable, by adding the following:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/927410ae-369f-43f7-a372-24a3bb4b1f47.png"/></div>
            
            <p>In our Debug panel, we see that we get the numbers 10 through 19. One thing to note
               is that these two <kbd>for...in</kbd> loops have different variables. In the first loop, we used value, and in the second
               one, we used index. You can make these whatever you choose them to be.
            </p>
            
            <p>In addition, in the two preceding examples, we used constants, but we could actually
               just use the Ranges within the loop. Add the following:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/03c9b4e1-542e-44d9-90d6-f3c2292c7eec.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now, you see 0 to 3 print inside of the Debug panel.</p>
            
            <p>What if you wanted the numbers to go in reverse order? Let's input the following <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/f943f934-cd94-4c3d-82fb-44568be56c2a.png"/></div>
            
            <p>We now have the numbers in descending order in our Debug panel. When we add Ranges
               into a <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop, we have to wrap our range inside parentheses so that Swift recognizes that
               our period before <kbd>reversed()</kbd> is not a decimal. Now that we are familiar with loops, there is one more range we
               need to look at.
            </p>

            <p>A one-sided Range operator allows you to use ranges that continue as far as possible
               in one direction. If you wanted to have the range just continue then this is what
               you would use. Let's look at a one sided range:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/0a3e787c-b69a-423a-bea0-153b9a0a2a4d.png"/></div>
            <pre>for name in names[...6] { 
    print("") 
} 
 
// Craig 
// Teena</pre>
            <pre>// Jason 
// Joshua 
// Myah 
// Tiffany 
// Kim </pre>
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/38582f87-6dcc-4736-85e0-8608c8a75d91.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Another useful loop is the <kbd>while</kbd> loop. Let's take a look at how the <kbd>while</kbd> loop is used.
            </p>

            <h1 class="header-title">The while loop</h1>
            
         </header>
         
         
         <article>
            
            
            <p>A <kbd>while</kbd> loop executes a bool expression at the start of the loop and the set of statements
               run until a condition becomes false. It is important to note that <kbd>while</kbd> loops can be executed zero or more times. Here is the basic syntax of a while loop:
            </p>
            <pre>while &lt;condition&gt; { 
 // statement 
} </pre>
            <p>Let's write a <kbd>while</kbd> loop in Playgrounds and see how it works. Add the following:
            </p>
            
            <div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/94f70a96-18a6-46aa-bca0-ae5354b91f99.png"/></div>
            
            <p>So, this <kbd>while</kbd> loop starts with a variable that begins at zero. Before the <kbd>while</kbd> loop executes, it checks to see if <kbd>y</kbd> is less than <kbd>50</kbd>-and, if so, it continues into the loop. Using the <kbd>+=</kbd> operator, which we covered earlier, we increment <kbd>y</kbd> by five each time. Our <kbd>while</kbd> loop will continue to do this until <kbd>y</kbd> is no longer less than <kbd>50</kbd>. Now, let's add the same <kbd>while</kbd> loop after the one we created and see what happens:
            </p>
            <pre>while y &lt; 50 {<br/>y += 5<br/>print("y:\(y)")<br/>}</pre>
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/f6ee09f3-7a86-4f59-b789-d3ddc32bc874.png"/></div>
            
            <p>You will notice that the second <kbd>while</kbd> loop never runs. This may not seem like it is important until we look at our next
               type of loop.

            <p>The <kbd>repeat...while</kbd> loop is pretty similar to a <kbd>while</kbd> loop, in that it continues to execute the set of statements until a condition becomes
               false. The main difference is that the <kbd>repeat...while</kbd> loop does not evaluate its bool condition until the end of the loop. Here is the
               basic syntax of a <kbd>repeat...while</kbd> loop:
            </p>
            <pre>repeat {<br/>// statement<br/>} &lt;condition&gt;</pre>
            <p>Let's write a <kbd>repeat...while</kbd> loop in Playgrounds and see how it works. Add the following into Playgrounds:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" src="assets/1e5631fc-126c-4b5c-ad76-57e75a519191.png"/></div>
            
            <p>You will notice that our <kbd>repeat...while</kbd> loop executes first and increments <kbd>x</kbd> by <kbd>5</kbd>, and after (as opposed to checking the condition before, as with a <kbd>while</kbd> loop), it checks to see if <kbd>x</kbd> is less than <kbd>100</kbd>. This means that our <kbd>repeat...while</kbd> loop will continue until the condition hits <kbd>100</kbd>. Here is where it gets interesting.
            </p>
            
            <p>Let's add another <kbd>repeat...while</kbd> loop after the one we just created:
            </p>
            
            <div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e0be44c8-611d-49f7-9685-07b1a39b3091.png"/></div>
            
            <p>Now, you can see that our <kbd>repeat...while</kbd> loop incremented to <kbd>105</kbd> instead of <kbd>100</kbd>, like the previous <kbd>repeat...while</kbd> loop. This happens because the bool expression does not get evaluated until after
               it is incremented by <kbd>5</kbd>. Knowing this behavior will help you pick the right loop for your situation.
            </p>

            <p>So far, we have looked at three loops: the <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop, the <kbd>while</kbd> loop, and the <kbd>repeat-while</kbd> loop. We will use the <kbd>for...in</kbd> loop again, but first we need to talk about collections. In the next chapter, we
               will focus on what collections are and how to use them when working with data. Make
               sure you fully understand loops, because we will build on them in the next chapter
               and throughout the book. Therefore, review as much as you need in order to make sure
               you feel that you are proficient in the topics contained in this chapter.
