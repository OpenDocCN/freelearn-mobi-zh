It helps you understand the nuances of iOS programming not only from a conceptual but also from an implementation perspective. This book is an invaluable resource if you are looking forward to exploring the world of iOS application programming.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Introducing Swift">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing Swift,</em></span> will take the reader through the process of installing Swift and running their first Swift program, in order to expose its power right away.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building Blocks – Variables, Collections, and Flow Control">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building Blocks - Variables, Collections, and Flow Control</em></span>, introduces you to the various built-in mechanisms Swift has for representing complex information in expressive and accessible ways, with the help of a real-world example.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. One Piece at a Time – Types, Scopes, and Projects">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>One Piece at a Time - Types, Scopes, and Projects</em></span>, introduces the tools necessary to closely model the real world with code. It will teach you how to define your own custom types using structures, classes, and enumerations. It also explores the concept of scope and access control.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. To Be or Not To Be – Optionals">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>To Be or Not To Be - Optionals</em></span>, focuses on a special and critical type in Swift, called optionals. It includes a detailed explanation of how optionals work and how they can be used, which turns a seemingly complex topic into a very intuitive concept.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. A Modern Paradigm – Closures and Functional Programming">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>A Modern Paradigm - Closures and Functional Programming</em></span>, introduces you to a new way of thinking about code called functional programming. We learn how Swift supports this technique and how we can apply it to our programs to make it even more understandable and expressive.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Make Swift Work For You – Protocols and Generics">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Make Swift Work For You - Protocols and Generics</em></span>, describes what generics and protocols are and how they can provide power and safety at the same time.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Everything Is Connected – Memory Management">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Everything Is Connected - Memory Management</em></span>, dives deeper into the inner-workings of Swift. We discuss how a computer stores information and how we can use that knowledge in combination with some new tools in Swift, to ensure that our code remains responsive and minimizes its effect on battery life.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Paths Less Traveled – Error Handling">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Paths Less Traveled – Error Handling</em></span>, goes into gracefully handling error situations in Swift with error throwing and catching.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Writing Code the Swift Way – Design Patterns and Techniques">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Writing Code the Swift Way - Design Patterns and Techniques</em></span>, introduces the reader to the art of programming by taking them through a number of specific design patterns that help reduce the complexity of code.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Harnessing the Past – Understanding and Translating Objective-C">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Harnessing the Past - Understanding and Translating Objective-C</em></span>, develops a basic understanding of Objective-C with a focus on how it compares to Swift. This allows the reader to make use of the vast resources that exist in Objective-C to help with their Swift development.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. A Whole New World – Developing an App">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>A Whole New World - Developing an App</em></span>, focuses on explaining the process of creating a real world iOS application, with the help of an example.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. What's Next? – Resources, Advice, and the Next Steps">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>What's Next? - Resources, Advice, and the Next Steps</em></span>, discusses how to move forward to become the best app developer you possibly can. It provides a list of resources and advice the reader can use to continue their Swift and app development learning process.</p></div></div>
