<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Part 1</em> of this book, we delved into .NET MAUI app development, while in <em class="italic">Part 2</em>, we explored .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid app development. As a result, we now have two different versions of the password management app from <em class="italic">Part 1</em> and <em class="italic">Part 2</em>. Both the XAML and Blazor Hybrid apps utilize the MVVM pattern in their design. While introducing the MVVM pattern, we highlighted the ability to test the view model and model independently. So, after the initial two parts of this book, we have thorough practice in app development.</p>
<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Part 3</em> of this book, we will turn our attention to other important aspects of software development, namely unit testing in .NET MAUI and the deployment process for .NET MAUI apps. By learning how to create mock components in unit tests, you will learn how to examine software modules within an isolated environment.</p>
