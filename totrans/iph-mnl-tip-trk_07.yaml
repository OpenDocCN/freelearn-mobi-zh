    that you have with you, and for many people, that camera is in their iPhone. Over
    the years, the iPhone's camera has steadily improved, to the point where it's
    now equal or superior to many standalone cameras. Many professional photographers
    even rely solely on the iPhone's camera to capture both still and video images
    that are indistinguishable from still and video images captured by standalone
    cameras.

    save them, and share them with others. Taking pictures can be fun for anyone,
    so feel free to point your iPhone camera at any interesting image to capture your
    memories.
