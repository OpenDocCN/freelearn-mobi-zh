- en: The iPhone is revolutionary. Every day, it seems, someone finds an innovative
    use for it and, in the App Store, the perfect outlet for their work. Its success
    has made apps cool and helped shift delivery of content away from the browser.
    Adobe has reacted to this change by repositioning the Flash platform, and providing
    the tools required for the creation and publication of native iOS applications
    directly from Flash Professional.

    AIR for iOS since its beginnings. I have paid particular attention to the fundamentals,
    focusing on the groundwork that many newcomers find daunting. For those with a
    firm grasp of the basics, there is plenty to learn, from working with the device's
    many sensors, to maximizing the performance of graphics using hardware acceleration.
