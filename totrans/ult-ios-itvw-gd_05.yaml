- en: Moving on to the second part of the book, we begin to look at the crucial Swift
    topics that interviewers commonly ask about and consider valuable. In this part,
    we will find a dozen interview questions covering areas such as data structures,
    optionals, memory management, generics, and testing. By the end of this part,
    we will have the knowledge to tackle most Swift-related interview questions.
