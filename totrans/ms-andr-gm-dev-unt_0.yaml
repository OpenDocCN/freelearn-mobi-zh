- en: Unity has come a long way from its humble beginnings; however, since the last
    couple of years, it has almost become an industry-wide used tool that almost all
    independent game developers use to develop their games. It is very easy to use
    to develop prototypes, and when you have a successful idea, it is flexible enough
    to expand the small prototype to a full-fledged game.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite its professional capacity, Unity is so simple to use that even a complete
    novice person can develop a basic game within a matter of hours. And with a little
    more effort, a very polished game can be developed with excellent lighting and
    animation.

    to everyone.

- en: In this book, we will cover a variety of topics both in 2D and 3D game development.
    We will see how to develop a game similar to JetPack Joyride in 2D, and a 3D fighting
    game with full 3D animation, lighting, and camera. We will also see how to add
    buttons, text, and screen transitions. Finally, once we have created the game,
    we will see how to monetize it by adding in-app purchases and ads.
