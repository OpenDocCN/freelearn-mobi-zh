- en: Welcome to *Part 3* of this book. With your user interface complete, you will
    now add code to implement your app’s functionality. To display your data in a
    list, you will use a table view, and you will learn how to use an array as a data
    source. Next, you’ll learn how to pass data from a view controller to the array
    used as a data source, and pass data from one view controller to another. You
    will also look at how to determine the device location and how to display a map
    containing annotations. After that, you will learn how to persist app data using
    JSON files. Then, you’ll learn how to create custom views, use the device camera
    and photo library, and add search capability to your table view. Finally, you’ll
    replace the table view with a collection view to make your app suitable for larger
    screens such as a Mac or iPad.
