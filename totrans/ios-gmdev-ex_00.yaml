- en: Sprite Kit is a set of tools to develop 2D games for the Apple iOS platform.
    Sprite Kit provides powerful features for graphics and the animation of images
    having texture, and so on. It is one of the best available game engines for iOS
    devices. It is very simple and powerful, with full support provided by Apple,
    hence it is more reliable and convenient than any third-party game engine available
    today.

- en: The Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Xcode, provided by Apple for app
    development can also be used for Sprite Kit game development. Objective-C or Swift,
    either of the two programming languages can be used for Sprite Kit game development.
    Sprite Kit is already being used by many developers for iOS game development.
    There is a good amount of information available that focuses on Sprite Kit set
    up and development. However, a structured and concise resource discussing about
    the complete development process and feature set is not currently available. This
    book explains the basics of Sprite Kit development and allows a beginner to become
    skilled in Sprite Kit game development using the Swift programming language with
    its complete set of development features. This book is a complete guide for Sprite
    Kit and a perfect starting point for those wanting to set sail on the iOS game
    industry.
