			<p>As a game developer, your goal is to reach your customers where they are, and with more and more people purchasing mobile devices every year, mobile is a crucial platform to consider. Luckily, Unity offers cross-platform capabilities, allowing you to write your game once and then port it to other consoles with minimal changes. However, developing for mobile devices also requires specific considerations and features, which is where <em class="italic">Unity 2022 Mobile Game Development</em> <span class="No-Break">comes in.</span></p>
			<p>In this book, we’ll guide you through the process of using Unity to create and deploy a mobile game to both iOS and Android. We’ll cover essential topics such as adding input for mobile devices, designing interfaces that adapt to various screen sizes, and exploring ways to monetize your game with Unity’s <strong class="bold">In-App Purchase</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAP</strong>) and advertisement systems. We’ll also discuss the importance of using notifications to retain users and share your game with the world using Twitter and <span class="No-Break">Facebook’s SDKs.</span></p>
			<p>Additionally, we’ll delve into Unity’s analytics system to optimize your game’s performance and provide insights into user behavior. You’ll also learn how to polish your game in various ways before publishing it on the Google Play and iOS <span class="No-Break">app stores.</span></p>
			<p>Lastly, we’ll cover the use of Unity’s AR Foundation framework, which enables you to create <strong class="bold">Augmented Reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">AR</strong>) apps that are future-proof and compatible with <span class="No-Break">multiple devices.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to use Unity for mobile game development, including crucial features unique to <span class="No-Break">mobile devices.</span></p>
