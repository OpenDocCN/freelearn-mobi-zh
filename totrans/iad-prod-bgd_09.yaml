    to track a user as they navigate between sites on their ad network. For example,
    if a user goes onto a site about scuba diving, then a hotel site, and finally
    an airline booking page—it's likely that he is going on holiday. The ad provider
    then takes this assumption and starts displaying adverts on non-holiday related
    sites about taking a trip. It uses similar techniques to contextual targeting
    to highlight the keywords on a page and gauge a common theme.

- en: CPM is the most common pricing model in advertising, because it is easily mapped
    to traditional print or TV advertising, in which copies sold or ratings would
    be used to determine the effective number of eyeballs viewing the ad. **Eyeballs**
    is the term coined by the advertising industry for viewers of their advertisements.
    With iAd, we refer to people interacting with our ads as users, because they're
    more important and engaged than a basic viewer, thanks to iAd's compelling ads.
    With CPM, you're paying to show the viewer your banner, regardless of whether
    they decide to click or tap on it.
  id: totrans-46

    dividing it by 1000\. For example, a campaign with a CPM which costs $20 would
    represent a fee of $0.02 every time a user views your ad's banner.

    a user clicks the link to your website or taps the banner of your ad. The **Cost
    per Click (CPC)** is the average of how much each click (or tap) will cost you.
    No matter how many impressions your banner receives, you only have to pay whenever
    your banner is tapped and your ad opened. Paying per click can be more valuable
    than CPM, as you only have to pay when a user shows an interest and taps your
    banner to begin engaging with your brand.

    set up a section for our downloadable content on two of our ad's pages. This means
    any analytics logging generated by these pages, such as it coming into view or
    the user interacting with the content, will be filterable in the iAd reporting
    interface. While sections might not seem necessary or too powerful in smaller
    ads, when you start pushing the boundaries of iAd Producer with hidden navigation
    and advanced page structures, it'll quickly become vital.

    By grouping data into sections, analyzing the popular and engaging parts of your
    ad can be made much easier. You can map trends, and tweak and update your ad and
    campaign to match these responses. For example, if you notice more people using
    your store finder than your e-mail sharing feature, you could put more emphasis
    on the store finder or even consider opening additional stores in popular areas.
