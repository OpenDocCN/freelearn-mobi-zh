    user''s demographic and interests.'

    to track a user as they navigate between sites on their ad network. For example,
    if a user goes onto a site about scuba diving, then a hotel site, and finally
    an airline booking page—it's likely that he is going on holiday. The ad provider
    then takes this assumption and starts displaying adverts on non-holiday related
    sites about taking a trip. It uses similar techniques to contextual targeting
    to highlight the keywords on a page and gauge a common theme.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CPM is the most common pricing model in advertising, because it is easily mapped
    to traditional print or TV advertising, in which copies sold or ratings would
    be used to determine the effective number of eyeballs viewing the ad. **Eyeballs**
    is the term coined by the advertising industry for viewers of their advertisements.
    With iAd, we refer to people interacting with our ads as users, because they're
    more important and engaged than a basic viewer, thanks to iAd's compelling ads.
    With CPM, you're paying to show the viewer your banner, regardless of whether
    they decide to click or tap on it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can calculate the cost per impression of our ad by taking the CPM price and
    dividing it by 1000\. For example, a campaign with a CPM which costs $20 would
    represent a fee of $0.02 every time a user views your ad's banner.

    a user clicks the link to your website or taps the banner of your ad. The **Cost
    per Click (CPC)** is the average of how much each click (or tap) will cost you.
    No matter how many impressions your banner receives, you only have to pay whenever
    your banner is tapped and your ad opened. Paying per click can be more valuable
    than CPM, as you only have to pay when a user shows an interest and taps your
    banner to begin engaging with your brand.

    the publishing network picks the highest bidder more often when displaying banners.
    You still only have to pay when a user clicks your banner, not per impression.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're willing to pay more per click, then the ad network is more likely
    to show your banner over a competing banner. You'll usually only pay a little
    over the bidder below you, instead of your maximum bid price.
