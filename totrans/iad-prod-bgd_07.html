The iPad screen is substantially larger, and Apple requires you to redesign and plan your ads to take full advantage of this; but we'll be able to share many of the same resources and assets.<a class="indexterm" id="id278"/>
</p><p>If you're using your own assets in the chapter, you'll need the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A large logo image for the menu screen</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A background image for your banner, 1024px wide and 66px high</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A small icon or logo for your banner</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A background image, 1024px wide by 768px high, to be used throughout the pages of your ad</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An image to be used in your splash screen, around 300px wide and 200px high</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Several photographical images to be used in a gallery</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A 2000px wide and 768px high image the user will pan across the screen</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A background for your banner image</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A short, fullscreen movie, 512px wide and 384px high</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A poster image and a snapshot of your movie</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A custom map pin icon, approximately 100px wide and 100px high</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Menu icons, including a back button, for each page of your ad</li></ul></div><p>To recap from earlier when we looked at size limits for our iAd, an iPad iAd has a more lenient limit, as there are more resources that are typically larger than the smaller-screen iPhone ads. Bear in mind these restrictions when creating your resources:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The banner size is limited to 65 KB.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Full screen banners (only available on iPad) can be up to 350 KB.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The<span class="strong"><strong> Splash</strong></span> page has a maximum size of 300 KB.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">As with other ads, the remaining pages don't have a maximum size, but including too many resources will increase your advert's loading time. Try to keep the number of media elements in each page of your iAd to under 20.</li></ul></div><p>When building your iAd, you're able to use the project warnings window to view any issues with your ad, including if you've reached the file size limit. To view your project warnings select<span class="strong"><strong> Export</strong></span> |<span class="strong"><strong> Show Project Warnings</strong></span> from the menu bar in iAd Producer. Here's an example<span class="strong"><strong> Project Report</strong></span> window showing a project's warnings:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Creating an iPad iAd" src="graphics/1321_07_02.jpg"/></div><p>If your assets are too large, consider using the optimization techniques covered in<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Preparing Your Content for Mobile"> Chapter 2</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em>Preparing Your Content for Mobile.</em></span></p><p>Currently, the iPad doesn't have a retina display, like the iPhone, so you don't need to create your assets at double the resolution; however, remember to work with as high a resolution as possible when creating resources for you iAd. Ensuring you're working with high resolutions means, if Apple do ever release an iPad with a retina display, you won't have to remake all your assets at a higher resolution.<a class="indexterm" id="id279"/>

</p><p>iPad ads are almost identical to their iPhone counterparts, besides the additional screen estate; however, on the iPad, we're able to create fullscreen HTML5 banners.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Time for action &#x2014; adding a banner to your iPad ad"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec03"/>Time for action — adding a banner to your iPad ad</h1></div></div></div><p>iPad banners are split into two categories: dynamic banners, like those found on the iPhone, and fullscreen HTML5 banners that are only available on the iPad. We'll look at fullscreen banners next, but first let's create a dynamic banner that works in portrait and landscape:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Open your project in iAd Producer; if you're using the example project, open the<code class="literal"> Cloud 9 - iPad</code> project. From the ad overview, double-click on the banner to open the template chooser. You'll notice that the templates are separated into two categories; for now, select the<span class="strong"><strong> Image and Text</strong></span> banner type. Double-click on the banner again to open it on the editing canvas.<a class="indexterm" id="id283"/></li><li class="listitem">By default, iAd Producer scales the banner to 50 percent; however, this scaled-down view can make it difficult to anticipate how our ad will look on the device. Select<span class="strong"><strong> View</strong></span> from the top right of iAd Producer, and then choose<span class="strong"><strong> iPad (100%)</strong></span>. You'll now see the canvas at the correct size; if your Mac screen isn't large enough to show the complete canvas, you'll be able to scroll around to view the entire banner. You might want to resize the iAd Producer window to increase the space available to the canvas. You can do the same by clicking-and-dragging the bottom right of the window outwards:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — adding a banner to your iPad ad" src="graphics/1321_07_03.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now that we have a placeholder banner, we can customize the elements just like we would on an iPhone project. Let's change the background of the banner to an image of clouds. Open the<span class="strong"><strong> Inspector</strong></span> and expand the<span class="strong"><strong> Background</strong></span> section; now change the type to<span class="strong"><strong> Image</strong></span> and, using the file selector drop-down, select<span class="strong"><strong> clouds-banner.jpg</strong></span> as the background image. You'll see the canvas update to show the background. If you want to close the inspector to make the canvas fit the whole banner then click on the<span class="strong"><strong> Inspector</strong></span> icon again to hide it.<a class="indexterm" id="id284"/><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note101"/>Note</h3><p>We're using a background image that is 1024px wide and 66px high, so when the banner is viewed in portrait (768px wide), the background is cropped at the edges. Creating an image that works in both orientations is vital to keep the size of your banner low and lightweight.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">From<span class="strong"><strong> Asset Library</strong></span>, drag the image<span class="strong"><strong> banner-plane.png</strong></span> to the image placeholder on the canvas. You'll see a fighter jet, complete with shadow, appear on the canvas.</li><li class="listitem">By default, the<span class="strong"><strong> Image and Text</strong></span> template just appears on the banner, which isn't very compelling. Let's change the animation of the image so it flies in from the left of the screen. With the image selected, expand the<span class="strong"><strong> Actions</strong></span> pane and add a new action, using the<span class="strong"><strong> Slide In</strong></span> animation. Change the<span class="strong"><strong> Delay</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> 0.5s</strong></span> and the<span class="strong"><strong> Duration</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> 3.5s</strong></span>. We'll change the<span class="strong"><strong> Easing</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> Linear</strong></span>, as this will prevent the animation from slowing down at the end. Your action settings should look similar to these:<div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — adding a banner to your iPad ad" src="graphics/1321_07_04.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Move the image so it's off the canvas, to the right of the banner. This means the slide-in animation will move the image to this point from the left of the screen, so it appears to fly across.<a class="indexterm" id="id285"/></li><li class="listitem">With the slick airplane animation capturing the user's attention, let's change the label text to get them to tap to find out more. Double-click on the placeholder label to enter the text editing mode, and change the text to something like<code class="literal"> Ever wanted to learn to fly..?</code>. You might need to resize the label to fit all the text into view. Move the label to the center of the banner. This will stop our banner looking unbalanced once the plane animation has finished. The yellow grid lines should appear to snap the label to the middle of the banner.</li><li class="listitem">With the label still selected, open the<span class="strong"><strong> Inspector</strong></span> and change the text color to white. This should make the label stand out more against the cloud background.</li><li class="listitem">Keeping the label selected, open the<span class="strong"><strong> Actions</strong></span> pane. Add a<span class="strong"><strong> Slide In</strong></span> action like we did for the plane. This time, change the<span class="strong"><strong> Direction</strong></span> to be from the<span class="strong"><strong> Bottom</strong></span> and update the<span class="strong"><strong> Delay</strong></span> to<span class="strong"><strong> 4.2s</strong></span>. This will cause the text to appear after the main flying plane animation has ended.</li><li class="listitem">Your banner should look something like the following screenshot:<a class="indexterm" id="id286"/><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Time for action — adding a banner to your iPad ad" src="graphics/1321_07_05.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">With our banner looking great in portrait view, let's tweak it to work just as well in landscape. Click on the arrow next to the<span class="strong"><strong> View</strong></span> drop-down, at the top right of iAd Producer, to toggle between orientations, or select<span class="strong"><strong> View</strong></span> |<span class="strong"><strong> Landscape</strong></span> from the menu bar. You might want to hide the inspector pane to reveal more of the canvas.<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note102"/>Note</h3><p>Handling orientation is even more important on the iPad, as the device doesn't have a default orientation. App developers are encouraged to support both portrait and landscape.</p></div></li><li class="listitem">Now that you're in the landscape view for the banner, reposition the label so it's in the center of the canvas. You will notice that the background image has automatically spanned the full width of this wider banner.</li><li class="listitem">Save your iAd.</li></ol></div><div class="section" title="What just happened?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec02"/>What just happened?</h2></div></div></div><p>We just created a large iPad banner that works in both portrait and landscape. By using the build in and out animations, we simulated a plane flying across the canvas.</p><p>Now preview your iAd (preferably on a device) to view the animation, and test how it looks in both portrait and landscape. If you need to install iAd Tester on your iPad, or want to know how to scale and rotate the simulator, check back to<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Making Sure It Works"> Chapter 4</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em>Making Sure it Works.</em></span></p></div><div class="section" title="Have a go hero"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec03"/>Have a go hero</h2></div></div></div><p>Once the animation has finished, our banner is a little static; if you want, why not try adding a few tweaks and some polish to keep our banner engaging for the user after the initial animation. You could try the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Make the banner more interesting by replacing the label with a multi-label cell, adding some different text to each cell.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Add a shadow to the text, so it stands out in the clouds.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Add an image,<code class="literal"> clouds-banner-transparent.png</code>, to the canvas. Animate this from right to left, linearly, over 15 seconds. This will add even more depth to the animation of your banner.</li></ul></div><p>Now that we've got a great dynamic banner, let's take a look at including a large, immersive, full screen HTML5 banner.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Filling the screen with HTML5 full screen banners"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec04"/>Filling the screen with HTML5 full screen banners</h1></div></div></div><p>Starting with iOS 4.3, released in March 2011, the iPad is able to display full screen banners. Similar to your splash screen, a full screen banner can only display elements. The user is unable to interact with it, as any touches on your banner will load the rich content of your core ad unit.<a class="indexterm" id="id287"/>
</p><p>HTML5 full screen banners will typically appear in apps such as magazines and games, displaying in between pages or transitioning a user between game levels. We can include multiple banner creatives in an iAd project. This means that the iAd framework, on a user's device, will load the most relevant banner for the user's current experience.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Time for action &#x2014; providing multiple banner creatives"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec05"/>Time for action — providing multiple banner creatives</h1></div></div></div><p>Any project, either iPhone or iPad, can have multiple banner creatives.

When an application developer is adding iAds into their app, they decide whether to use the dynamic banner or the HTML5 full screen banner. By providing both full screen and dynamic banners in your iAd project, your ad is able to appear in more apps.</p><p>You may wonder why this would be beneficial in an iPhone ad, where there is only one banner type, the dynamic banner. If you create an advert with multiple creative banners, the iAd framework will automatically cycle between them. This means users seeing your ad banner multiple times get a different banner, keeping your creative fresh.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note103"/>Note</h3><p>Your advert can have a combination of full screen and dynamic banners, and multiple banners of the same type. If you included multiple similar banners, be sure to update the name in the inspector pane to something identifiable, for each banner.</p></div></div></div>
