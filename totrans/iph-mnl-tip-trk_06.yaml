    or a similar smartphone. While tapping, swiping, and pinching the screen can be
    powerful ways to control an iPhone, an even more revolutionary interface is to
    use your voice.
  prefs: []

- en: Siri represents the new user interface that relies solely on voice commands.
    By simply speaking to Siri, you can control many features of your iPhone, from
    making phone calls and scheduling events to searching the internet and changing
    settings. With Siri, you can control your iPhone with nothing more than your voice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just keep in mind that although Siri can understand and respond to a wide variety
    of voice commands, it's still not perfect. Sometimes when talking to Siri, you
    may need to rephrase your commands using different words or changing the order
    of your words.

    example, French speakers can choose between France, Canada, or Belgium regions
