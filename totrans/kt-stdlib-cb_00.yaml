- en: The primary aim of *Kotlin Standard Library Cookbook* is to help you dive into
    advanced language concepts and features as fast as possible in a friendly way.
    It covers a wide range of general programming problems at varying difficulty levels,
    including design patterns, functional programming, data processing, and more.
    The book consists of recipes that present a specific problem and give a step-by-step
    explanation of how to approach it effectively. All the presented features of the
    standard library are well explained, allowing you to discover them with ease.

- en: This book will help software developers switch to Kotlin with ease and integrate
    it seamlessly into the existing JVM and JavaScript projects. Examples included
    in the book can easily be implemented in your own projects. You can also get the
    ready-made solutions from the book's GitHub repository if you prefer to follow
    and test the recipes in your favorite IDE. Once you have completed the book, you
    should have expert knowledge and insight into the language's advanced concepts,
    allowing you to address your daily programming challenges efficiently.

    and Sequences,* presents the concept of Kotlin ranges and sequences. It shows
    how to approach common algorithmic problems by defining custom sequences and how
    to define ranges for custom classes.'

    and Adjustable Interfaces,* shows how to approach designing functions and interfaces
    using the language''s built-in features. The chapter explains how to implement
    clean, reusable functions, and scalable interfaces containing default implementations.
    The recipes also cover other features of the language, such as inlining closures,
    destructuring variables, reified type parameters, and other useful tips that help
    design more flexible and natural code.'

    Kotlin Functional Programming Features,* shows how to solve real-life programming
    challenges by adopting state-of-the-art functional programming patterns. The chapter
    helps readers get familiar with Kotlin support for functional programming concepts
    provided by the standard library and the built-in language features.'

    focuses on presenting standard library support for declarative style operations
    on collections. The included recipes present solutions to varying programming
    problems related to dataset transformations, reducing, or filtering. The chapter
    shows how to approach data processing operations practicing a functional programming
    style with the use of powerful functionalities built into the standard library.'

    Adopting Kotlin Concepts,* presents the Kotlin-specific approach to implementing
    popular design patterns, including the Observer and Lazy delegates, Builder, Strategy,
    and more. Design patterns presented in the following chapter are backed by real-life
    examples that emphasize the benefits of the Delegation pattern.'

    presents useful extension functions available in the standard library that simplify
    the work with I/O operations. The chapter focuses on common use cases of read-write
    operations on files, working with streams and buffers, and the Kotlin approach
    to traversing files available in a specific directory.'

    Programming Great Again,* is an in-depth guide to asynchronous programming focusing
    on the Kotlin coroutines framework and its application in real-life situations.
    The chapter presents how to optimize and advance previous examples by executing
    parts of their code in the background in a non-blocking way. Here, you will also
    find a practical example of implementing an asynchronous REST client with the
    Retrofit library and the coroutines framework.'

    the Android, JUnit, and JVM UI Frameworks,* covers practical problems specific
    to the popular frameworks, among which Kotlin is the one used most often. In general,
    it will focus on Android platform-specific aspects and asynchronous UI programming
    with coroutines, both on Android and JVM frameworks such as JavaFX and Swing.
    It will also help you to write effective unit tests for the JVM platform using
    the JUnit framework. The recipes related to unit testing will also include more
    advanced topics, such as mocking dependencies with the Mockito Kotlin library
    and testing asynchronous code based on the coroutines framework.'
