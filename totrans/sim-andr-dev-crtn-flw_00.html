			<p>Kotlin coroutines and flows allow developers to do asynchronous programming in Android using simple, modern, and testable code.</p>
			<p>This book focuses on coroutines and flows using hands-on learning. You will begin with the basics of asynchronous programming, including an overview of coroutines and flows while also integrating them into your Android projects. You’ll understand how to manage cancelations and exceptions, and then explore how to test your coroutines and flows.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will be able to use Kotlin coroutines and flows to simplify asynchronous programming in Android.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for Android developers who want to build high-quality apps using coroutines and flows and level up their Android development skills. Beginners with basic knowledge of Android development and Kotlin will also find this book useful.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B17773_01_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Asynchronous Programming in Android</em>, visits asynchronous programming in Android and shows the various ways it is being done now. Toward the end, the new recommended ways of coroutines and flows will be introduced.</p>
			<p><a href="B17773_02_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor029"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding Kotlin Coroutines</em>, introduces Kotlin coroutines and shows how they can be used for asynchronous programming in Android. It will demonstrate how to create coroutines, and discuss coroutine builders, scopes, dispatchers, contexts, and jobs.</p>
			<p><a href="B17773_03_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor042"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Handling Coroutine Cancelations and Exceptions</em>, discusses coroutine cancelations, and how you can manage coroutine cancelations, timeouts, and exceptions properly.</p>
			<p><a href="B17773_04_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor051"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Testing Kotlin Coroutines</em>, describes how you can test Kotlin coroutines in Android.</p>
			<p><a href="B17773_05_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Kotlin Flows</em>, covers the basics of Kotlin flows and how they can be used for asynchronous programming in Android. It continues with creating flows with flow builders. It will also discuss flow operators, buffering and combining flows, and StateFlow and SharedFlow.</p>
			<p><a href="B17773_06_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor075"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Handling Flow Cancelations and Exceptions</em>, explores how to manage cancelations, completion, and exceptions in your flows.</p>
			<p><a href="B17773_07_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor083"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Testing Kotlin Flows</em>, provides details on how you can test the flows in your Android project.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Conventions used</h1>
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
			<p><code>Code in text</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “<code>runOnUIThread</code> will perform the <code>displayText(text)</code> function on the main UI thread.”</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">lifecycleScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">     val fetchedText = fetchText()</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">       </pre>
			<pre class="source-code">     withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">           displayText(fetchedText)</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    }</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">}</pre>
			<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">private fun fetchTextWithThread() {</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">     Thread {</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">          // get text from network</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">          val text = getTextFromNetwork()</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">           <strong class="bold">runOnUiThread {</strong></pre>
			<pre class="source-code"><strong class="bold">                // Display on UI</strong></pre>
			<pre class="source-code">                <strong class="bold">displayText(text)</strong></pre>
			<pre class="source-code"><strong class="bold">           }</strong></pre>
			<pre class="source-code">      }.start()</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">}</pre>
			<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
			<pre>java.lang.IllegalStateException: Module with the Main dispatcher had failed to initialize. For tests Dispatchers.setMain from kotlinx-coroutines-test module can be used</pre>
			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: “In Android Studio, the <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> window identifies the suspending function calls in your code with a gutter icon next to the line number.”</p>
