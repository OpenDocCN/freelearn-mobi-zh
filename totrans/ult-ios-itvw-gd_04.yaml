    are, well, passive.
  id: totrans-48

    answers or comments. As weird as it sounds, asking questions provides us with
    a rating, but more importantly, it exposes us to the community and opens new communication
    channels with other developers. The most important about asking a question is
    to do it right – duplicate questions will be removed or marked as spam. Also,
    we need to provide all details and code snippets and mark the correct tags.
  id: totrans-49

    in Stack Overflow.

    search for questions to answer. This is a different type of user – they like to
    phrase solutions to complex problems, publish code snippets, and conduct discussions
    about best practices and mythology. It’s an excellent way to start our workday
    while going over questions in Stack Overflow, filtered by tags such as **iOS**,
    **Swift**, or **UIKit**. It is not an impossible mission to answer questions in
    Stack Overflow and gain a high reputation; it is just a matter of priorities and
    effort.
  id: totrans-52

    in our busy schedule to work on a side project. But do the math – 10 minutes a
    day sums up to five hours a month and 30 hours in half a year. We don’t have to
    quit our job or spend endless nights on a side project. We just need to manage

    subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. Although binary

    project. One of the top reasons is the *drive to change* a product we often use.
    Another reason is *empowering our skills*. We are not here to talk about how open
    source projects help us as developers but how contributing to an open source helps

    to make sure that whatever way we choose is suitable for us and the image we want

    an open source project can be frustrating at first. We must dive into an existing
    project, handle intensive communication with other developers, and get used to
    cruel pull requests rejected with insulting comments. Is this what we imagined
    when we planned on joining an open source project?
