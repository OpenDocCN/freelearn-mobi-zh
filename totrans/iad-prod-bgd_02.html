<div class="section" title="Overcoming mobile constraints"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec02"/>Overcoming mobile constraints</h1></div></div></div><p>As with all mobile devices, the iPhone's smaller screen and portability means that there are limitations in the physical size, processing power, and connectivity available. These limitations shouldn't be feared, instead they're great opportunities to refine your message and deliver the most relevant experience to your future customers.<a class="indexterm" id="id47"/>
</p><div class="section" title="Designing for the small screen"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec01"/>Designing for the small screen</h2></div></div></div><p>Smaller screens means you need to make better use of the limited screen space available to you; for example, tappable areas need to consider the inconsistent accuracy of users' fingers. We need to make sure all tappable areas are at least 88px tall and wide, with sufficient space between each actionable element to prevent unintentional taps that are detrimental to the user experience.<a class="indexterm" id="id48"/>
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"/>Note</h3><p>When designing your iAd banner, keep in mind that the bottom-right of the banner will be obscured by the iAd logo, so don't put any important information there.</p></div><p>It's important to remember that you shouldn't try to fit your entire product line or company ethos into your iAd. The captivating experience and unique opportunity to engage directly with the user should focus on just a few key products or points, encouraging them to act on and meet your ad goals.</p><p>When dealing with ads in a mobile context, users are often in an environment filled with distractions, so creating clear, responsive screens that are intuitive to the user is the key to achieving a successful iAd.</p></div><div class="section" title="Delivering content when download speeds are limited"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec02"/>Delivering content when download speeds are limited</h2></div></div></div><p>If you want your iAd to reach the widest audience, you need to assume that the majority of your users may be connecting over the generally slow cellular network. A slow connection means longer waits before users can see your awesome iAd! Because of this, certain restrictions and recommendations are in place.<a class="indexterm" id="id49"/>
</p><div class="section" title="Complying with file size restrictions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec01"/>Complying with file size restrictions</h3></div></div></div><p>Apple restricts the file size of the initial parts of your iAd, the banner, and splash screen, so that they load quickly and engage the user within the key first 15 seconds.<a class="indexterm" id="id50"/>
</p><p>Your HTML5 Banner can be up to the following size:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">60KB on iPhone/iPod touch devices with high-resolution displays</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">40KB on iPhone/iPod touch devices with standard resolution displays</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">65KB on iPads</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">150KB for iPad fullscreen HTML5 banners<a class="indexterm" id="id51"/></li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"/>Note</h3><p>The banner size limit includes both the portrait and the landscape versions of your banner, so it's important to design it in such a way that many of the same resources can be used in either orientation.</p></div><p>Your splash screen can be up to the following size:<a class="indexterm" id="id52"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">256KB on iPhone/iPod touch devices with high-resolution displays</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">128KB on iPhone/iPod touch devices with standard resolution displays</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">300KB on iPads</li></ul></div><p>Notice how you get twice the storage space for high-resolution displays; that's because there's twice the number of horizontal and vertical pixels in Apple's high-resolution displays (branded Retina display), so images end up being approximately twice the size as a result.</p><p>Always work with the high-resolution display size, as iAd Producer will scale down assets automatically, when you build your iAd.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Try to keep the total number of resources that are loading in your iAd, at any one time, to 20 or fewer. Every request for a file includes some extra overhead that slows down the loading each time the network is accessed.</p></div><p>Your core ad unit can load larger resources, but it's a good practice to keep these resources small. Fortunately there are plenty of ways to optimize your assets for mobile delivery.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Working with images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec03"/>Working with images</h1></div></div></div><p>Images are used throughout your iAd, for backgrounds, themed graphics, your logo, image galleries, and user-configurable wallpapers. They're probably the most common media type in your iAd and are available in a variety of formats, which can be manipulated and edited to enhance your ad's performance and experience.<a class="indexterm" id="id53"/>
</p><div class="section" title="Understanding the different image formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec03"/>Understanding the different image formats</h2></div></div></div><p>In our iAds, images can be either<span class="strong"><strong> JPEG</strong></span> or<span class="strong"><strong> PNG</strong></span>, depending on what kind of image they contain or what they're going to be used for. JPEGs are typically smaller in file size, as they can be extensively compressed. PNGs often are better quality and more versatile, but this comes at the cost of their larger file size.<a class="indexterm" id="id54"/>
</p><p>You should use JPEGs whenever you can. However, consider using PNGs when:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Your image contains text:</strong></span> The crisp edges of text can get lost when the JPEG is compressed.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Your image contains sharp edges or shapes:</strong></span> Just like with text, the JPEG compression process often blurs sharp line edges.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Your image has large sections of solid color:</strong></span> JPEG compression can cause a blocking effect on large sections of color.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Your image has transparency:</strong></span> Elements behind your image are still partially visible, if it has parts which are transparent. Therefore, you have to use PNG as JPEG doesn't suppot transparency.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Resizing an image"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec04"/>Resizing an image</h2></div></div></div><p>Chances are that most of your assets won't be of the correct size or in the right format to go straight into your iAd.<a class="indexterm" id="id55"/>
</p><p>We can use<span class="strong"><strong> Preview</strong></span>, a tool built into all Macs that is used for the manipulation of images and documents. Despite being called Preview, its little-known, built-in editing functionality is extensive, giving us a free, quick, and professional way to get our content into the right format for our iAd.</p></div></div>

The reference movie is loaded by the iPhone or iPad then decides if it wants the high quality (the larger file, in this case<code class="literal"> dino-stores-intro - iPhone.m4v)</code>, or the lower quality (the smaller file,<code class="literal"> dino-stores-intro - iPhone (Cellular).3gp)</code>.
