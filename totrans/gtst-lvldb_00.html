This book teaches you all about LevelDB using iOS and OS X examples.</p><p>If you need to store data in a persistent dictionary, build complex data structures that are hard to model in SQL, or just push performance boundaries, LevelDB provides the building blocks. To get beyond the basics, you need to understand the programming patterns that allow for more complex data modeling in a key-value store.</p><p>This book provides the understanding and coding tools to get the most out of LevelDB. The principles it teaches can also be applied to other sorted key-value stores. The book is suited for programmers, but includes enough theory to be interesting for a DBA or software architect.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Downloading LevelDB and Building with OS X">Chapter 1</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Downloading LevelDB and Building with OS X</em></span>, goes in detail through the downloading and building of the open-source LevelDB including dealing with Unix idioms. It includes building a trivial OS X application to prove the database is working.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Installing LevelDB and Building for iOS">Chapter 2</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Installing LevelDB and Building for iOS,</em></span> repeats the library building process to get a LevelDB library for use in the simulator and on iOS devices. It includes building a trivial iOS application to prove the database is working.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Basic Key-value Operations – Creating and Deleting Data">Chapter 3</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Basic Key-value Operations – Creating and Deleting Data</em></span>, teaches you a little C++ as you learn how to store, retrieve, and delete data in a LevelDB database.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Iteration and Searching Keys">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Iteration and Searching Keys</em></span>, goes beyond reading exact keys to show you how to efficiently iterate through all or part of the database, in order. It introduces the concept of storing key values to refer to other records.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Using Objective-C">Chapter 5</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Using Objective-C</em></span>, introduces the three main Objective-C wrappers released for LevelDB and compares their use with each other as well as the traditional C++ API used in previous chapters.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Integrating with a Cocoa UI">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Integrating with a Cocoa UI</em></span>, shows how a typical form-based application can have lists of records loaded from a database and maps text entry fields to store a database record using simple JSON arrays.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Debugging with REPLs and Command Lines">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Debugging with REPLs and Command Lines</em></span>, provides some debugging tools to help inspect your database. It includes a general purpose web server library that can be integrated into any iOS application to provide a debugging interface.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Richer Keys and Data Structures">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Richer Keys and Data Structures</em></span>, expands our simple GUI example with full record editing and different list sorting. It builds upon that example with a discussion of key design compared to SQL and custom key comparators.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. A Document Database">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>A Document Database</em></span>, builds a different example program to show schema design using an extension of the APLevelDB Objective-C wrapper. It also covers how the LevelDB folder can be treated as a single package to appear as one item in the finder.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Tuning and Key Policies">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Tuning and Key Policies</em></span>, presents the basics of LevelDB's implementation as a foundation for discussing how to tune it for your application needs.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Scripting Languages">Appendix A</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting Languages</em></span>, takes a quick look at using LevelDB from Node.js, Python, and Ruby scripting languages.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>To build the samples in this book you need a current version of Apple's Xcode compiler. The remaining downloading of open source is described as needed per chapter. To test sample programs on iOS devices you will need to be a paid member of the Apple Developer program.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is primarily for programmers who need a flexible database engine that is easy to start with but capable of scaling to hundreds of millions of entries. It will be of interest to database designers, architects, and technical managers who want to learn more detail about sorted key-value stores.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text are shown as follows: "A further check you can make on your LevelDB library is to run the <code class="literal">db_bench</code> command."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;
