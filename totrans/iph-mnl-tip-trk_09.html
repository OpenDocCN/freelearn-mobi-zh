		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-152"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor383"/>Chapter 9</em>: Browsing the Internet with Safari</h1>
			<p>One appeal of the iPhone is that it puts a computer in your pocket. When the internet first arose for public use, people relied on personal computers to browse websites. However, the iPhone made web browsing possible on a mobile device. </p>
			<p>Now, if you want to find information on the internet, you don't have to wait until you get home to use a bulky computer. Instead, you can visit websites on your iPhone and do everything from online shopping and watching videos to reading news and responding to blog posts. </p>
			<p>Although web browsing on the iPhone is different because of the smaller iPhone screen compared to the larger screen of desktop or laptop computers, the principles remain the same: load a browser and visit a website. The difference is just learning how to type and view websites on the smaller screen and virtual keyboard of the iPhone.</p>
			<p>The topics that this chapter covers are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Browsing websites</li>
				<li>Navigating between web pages </li>
				<li>Opening and switching between multiple web pages</li>
				<li>Private browsing</li>
				<li>Bookmarking websites</li>
				<li>Viewing browsing history</li>
				<li>Using reading lists</li>
				<li>Sharing websites</li>
				<li>Searching with Safari</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Every iPhone comes with the<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> Safari browser, which is similar to the Safari browser found on every Macintosh (you can always download and install other browsers on your iPhone, but this chapter focuses exclusively on using Safari).</p>
			<p>To browse any website, you just need to know the website address, such as <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">www.yahoo.com</a> or just <a href="http://apple.com">apple.com</a>. Once you know which website to visit, you need to type that information into Safari. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You do not need to type in the complete website address, such as <code>https://www.yahoo.com</code>. It's often simpler and faster to type only the website name (such as <code>yahoo</code>) and its domain (such as <code>.com</code>), rather than typing in <code>https://</code> or <code>www</code>. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-154">Typing a website address<a id="_idTextAnchor388"/><a id="_idTextAnchor389"/></h2>
			<p>The first time you start Safari, you<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> must type a website address to visit anything on the internet. From that point on, Safari keeps track of the websites you've visited, so you<a id="_idIndexMarker550"/> won't have to type the complete website address again to visit that site. </p>
			<p>To type a website address into Safari, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the text field at the top of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.1</em>. This text field lets you type a website address or a search query. As soon as you tap inside the text field, a keyboard appears at the bottom of the screen:<div><img alt="Figure 9.1 – The text field at the top of the screen in Safari&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.1 – The text field at the top of the screen in Safari</p></li>
				<li>Type a website address, such as <code>microsoft.com</code> or <code>nasa.gov</code>, and tap the <strong class="bold">go </strong>button that appears highlighted in blue in the bottom-right corner of the virtual keyboard, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.2</em>. If you typed a valid website address, the website <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>appears on the screen:<p class="figure-caption"><a id="_idTextAnchor390"/><a id="_idTextAnchor391"/></p><div><img alt=" Figure 9.2 – The go button on the virtual keyboard&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"> Figure 9.2 – The go button on the virtual keyboard</p></li>
				<li>Tilt your iPhone in<a id="_idIndexMarker552"/> portrait or landscape orientation to view any website in different ways, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.3</em>. Most (but not all) websites will adjust their content based on the orientation of the iPhone:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.3 – You can view any website in portrait or landscape orientation&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.03_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.3 – You can view any website in portrait or landscape orientation</p>
			<p>Once you visit a<a id="_idIndexMarker553"/> website, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker554"/> slide your finger up/down to scroll through all the available content. Since the iPhone screen is much smaller than a traditional computer monitor, you might want to shrink or enlarge the text or reload a website to make sure you're viewing the latest content.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor392"/>Changing text size </h2>
			<p>For some people, Safari <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>displays text too small, which makes it hard to read. For others, Safari displays text too large, which makes it hard to see all the content on a web page.</p>
			<p>To help you adjust the size of text displayed on a website, Safari lets you shrink or enlarge text. To shrink or enlarge text, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the text field at the top of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.1</em>) and type a website address, such as <code>yahoo.com</code>. A font size and reload icon appear, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.4</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.4 – The font size and reload icons&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.04_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.4 – The font size and reload icons</p></li>
				<li>Tap the font size icon. A menu <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>appears, showing the font size percentage, such as <strong class="bold">100%</strong>. A small <strong class="bold">A</strong> icon appears to the left, which shrinks the font size, while a larger <strong class="bold">A</strong> icon appears to the right, which increases the font size, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.5</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.5 – Changing the font size of text on a website&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.5 – Changing the font size of text on a website</p></li>
				<li>Tap the small <strong class="bold">A</strong> or large <strong class="bold">A</strong> icon to adjust the font size.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The font size icon lets you adjust the text size on each website you visit. If you prefer a specific font size for all websites, you can define a font size other than <strong class="bold">100%</strong>, which is the default setting.</p>
			<p>To define a font size magnification for all websites, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Safari</strong>. A list of Safari settings appears. Scroll down until you see <strong class="bold">Page Zoom</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Page Zoom</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Page Zoom</strong> screen <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.6</em>. The current website loaded in Safari appears at the top, such as <strong class="bold">yahoo.com</strong>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.6 – The Page Zoom screen lets you define a font size magnification for all websites&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.6 – The Page Zoom screen lets you define a font size magnification for all websites</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the name of the<a id="_idIndexMarker558"/> currently loaded website, such as <strong class="bold">yahoo.com</strong>, to adjust its font size, and then tap a magnification option, such as <strong class="bold">75%</strong> or <strong class="bold">125%</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Page Zoom</strong> back button in the upper-left corner of the screen to return to the <strong class="bold">Page Zoom</strong> screen.</li>
				<li>Tap a magnification option under the <strong class="bold">Other Websites</strong> category to define a magnification for all other websites.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>By changing the font size magnification for a single website or all websites, you can make browsing the internet comfortable for your eyes. </p>
			<p>In some cases, the font size magnification is fine, but the website content itself may be old. To make sure you have the latest content, you may want to reload a web page.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor393"/>Reloading web pages</h2>
			<p>If you visit a website, you'll usually <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>get the latest content. However, if that <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>content changes, Safari may not always display any changed content. To make sure you're viewing the latest content displayed on a website, you may need to periodically reload the web page.</p>
			<p>To reload a web page, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari app screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the text field at the top of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.1</em>) and type a website address, such as <code>yahoo.com</code>. A font size and reload icon appear (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.4</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the reload icon.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you visit a website, you'll probably need to know how to tap on links, as well as go back and forth between previous web pages. Fortunately, browsing the internet on an iPhone works identically to browsing the internet on a computer, except you need to use touch gestures and look for icons at the top and bottom of the screen.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor394"/>Navigating between web pages</h1>
			<p>Most websites consist of<a id="_idIndexMarker561"/> multiple web pages, and its common to jump from one website to another. The three main ways to navigate from one web page to another are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tap on a hyperlink.</li>
				<li>Tap the back icon.</li>
				<li>Tap the forward icon.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Hyperlinks appear as blue text that will jump to another web page on either the same website or an entirely different website. <em class="italic">Figure 9.7</em> shows what a typical hyperlink looks like:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.7 – A hyperlink displayed on a web page&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.07_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.7 – A hyperlink displayed on a web page</p>
			<p>The back and forward icons<a id="_idIndexMarker562"/> appear at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.8</em>, any time you tap in the text field at the top of the screen: </p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.8 – The back and forward icons&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.08_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.8 – The back and forward icons</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note </p>
			<p class="callout">The forward icon will appear dimmed until you tap the back icon at least once.</p>
			<p>To see how to use hyperlinks and the back/forward icons, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap in the text field at the top of the screen and type a website address, such as <code>apple.com</code>. </li>
				<li>Tap on any blue hyperlink to visit another web page. </li>
				<li>Tap the text field at the top of the screen to make the back and forward icons appear at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the back icon. <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>Notice that the previous web page appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the forward icon. Notice that the web page you viewed before tapping the back icon appears.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Hyperlinks can take you to new web pages, while the back icon lets you return to previously viewed web pages. Once you tap the back icon at least once, you'll be able to tap the forward icon. The back and forward icons let you go back and forth between two or more previously viewed web pages. </p>
			<p>However, you may want to keep two or more web pages open and switch between them, which you can do in Safari on an iPhone as well.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor395"/>Opening and switching between multiple web pages</h1>
			<p>If you're familiar with<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> using a browser on a desktop or laptop computer, you <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>probably know about tabs. Tabs let you keep multiple web pages open and switch between them whenever you want.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-159">Opening additional <a id="_idTextAnchor396"/><a id="_idTextAnchor397"/>web pages</h2>
			<p>To open additional <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>web pages, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap in the text field at the top of the screen and type a website address, such as <code>apple.com</code>. A tab bar appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.9</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.9 – The show all tabs icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.9 – The show all tabs icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the show all tabs icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen. All open web pages appear and a <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon appears at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.10</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.10 – The + icon lets you open a new web page&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.10_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.10 – The + icon lets you open a new web page</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon. A text field <a id="_idIndexMarker567"/>appears at the top of the screen, along with a list of favorite and frequently visited websites, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.11</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.11 – Choosing a new web page to open&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.11_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.11 – Choosing a new web page to open</p></li>
				<li>Type a website address, or<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> tap on an icon that displays a previously visited website. Safari opens your chosen website.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've opened two or more websites, you need to know how to switch quickly between one and the other.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor398"/>Switching between open web pages</h2>
			<p>The advantage of <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>opening multiple web pages is that you can jump from one web page to another. For example, you might display a weather forecast, a sports score, and a news site on separate web pages so that you can view the information you want without the hassle of typing in a website address and waiting for a web page to load. </p>
			<p>To switch between web pages, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Make sure you have opened two or more web pages by following the instructions in the <em class="italic">Opening additional web pages</em> section.</li>
				<li>Tap in the text field at the top of the screen. The show all tabs icon appears at the bottom of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.9</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the show all tabs icon. All open web pages appear like stacked cards, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.12</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.12 – Viewing multiple open web pages&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.12_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.12 – Viewing multiple open web pages</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the web page you want to view. Your chosen web page appears in Safari.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Having multiple web pages<a id="_idIndexMarker570"/> open can be convenient since you don't have to close one web page and wait to load another one. However, you'll likely want to close one or more open web pages eventually when you no longer need them anymore.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor399"/>Closing web pages</h2>
			<p>The more web pages you open, the <a id="_idIndexMarker571"/>harder it can be to see them all. That's why you'll probably want to keep the number of open web pages to a reasonable amount and close any web pages you no longer want. </p>
			<p>To close a web page, follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Make sure you have opened two or more web pages by following the instructions in the <em class="italic">Opening additional web pages</em> section.</li>
				<li>Tap in the text field at the top of the screen. The show all tabs icon appears at the bottom of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.9</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the show all tabs icon. All open web pages appear like stacked cards (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.12</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the close icon (the <strong class="bold">X</strong> icon) in the upper-left corner of the web page that you want to close, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.13</em>:<div><img alt=" Figure 9.13 – The close icon on web pages&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.13_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption"> Figure 9.13 – The close icon on web pages</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each time you browse a website, you<a id="_idIndexMarker572"/> risk giving away information such as your current location or what type of information you've been searching for. If you want to protect your privacy, you should use Safari's private browsing options.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor400"/>Private browsing</h1>
			<p>Private browsing lets you visit websites <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>without tracking the history of the pages you visit, blocks <strong class="bold">AutoFill</strong> to prevent remembering passwords typed in a web page, and deletes any cookies when you close the web page that sent the browser a cookie. </p>
			<p>To use private browsing, follow<a id="_idIndexMarker574"/> these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the show all tabs icon.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Private</strong>. Safari displays a <strong class="bold">Private Browsing Mode</strong> message and highlights <strong class="bold">Private</strong> in the bottom-left corner, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.14</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.14 – Private Browsing Mode&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.14_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.14 – Private Browsing Mode</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon to open a website in private browsing mode.</li>
				<li>Tap in the text field at the top <a id="_idIndexMarker575"/>of the screen and type a website address, such as <code>apple.com</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you start browsing in private mode, you may want to turn private browsing mode off eventually. To turn off private browsing mode, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the show all tabs icon.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Private</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Toggling in and out of private<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> browsing mode can be handy, but you may want to define specific privacy settings within Safari as well.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor401"/>Defining privacy settings in Safari</h2>
			<p>Privacy settings let<a id="_idIndexMarker577"/> you define how much (or how little) information Safari gives out to websites; the following are some of the settings available:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Prevent Cross-Site Tracking</strong>: Blocks websites from tracking the websites you visit</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Block All Cookies</strong>: Blocks websites from storing data about your activities in a file referred to as a <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>cookie</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fraudulent Website Warning</strong>: Displays a warning if Safari detects a suspected phishing website, which is a site that mimics a known site for the purpose of stealing passwords and other important information</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Check for Apple Pay</strong>: Checks whether you can pay for products on websites through Apple Pay</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Clear History and Website Data</strong>: Removes your browsing history and data stored from visiting websites</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To define one or more privacy settings for Safari, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Safari</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> settings screen appears.</li>
				<li>Scroll down to the <strong class="bold">PRIVACY &amp; SECURITY</strong> category, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.15</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.15 – Safari's privacy and security settings &#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.15_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.15 – Safari's privacy and security settings </p></li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the green <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>switch to turn on or off <strong class="bold">Prevent Cross-Site Tracking</strong>.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the green switch to turn on or off <strong class="bold">Block All Cookies</strong>.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the green switch to turn on or off <strong class="bold">Fraudulent Website Warning</strong>.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap the green switch to turn on or off <strong class="bold">Check for Apple Pay</strong>.</li>
				<li>(Optional) tap <strong class="bold">Clear History and Website Data</strong> to erase your browsing history. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Whether you<a id="_idIndexMarker580"/> browse with or without privacy settings, you'll likely visit some websites more than others. Rather than constantly typing in the domain names of your favorite websites, it's much easier to bookmark favorite websites so that you can visit them with the tap of a finger.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor402"/>Bookmarking websites</h1>
			<p>Bookmarks let you save<a id="_idIndexMarker581"/> your favorite website addresses so that you don't have to type them in again when you want to visit them. Safari lets you organize bookmarks in folders, so that way, you might create a folder of just news websites, a second folder of entertainment websites, and a third folder of work-related websites. Folders simply help you keep your bookmarks organized.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor403"/>Creating a bookmark </h2>
			<p>To bookmark a favorite <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>website, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the<a id="_idIndexMarker583"/> Home Screen. The Safari screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap in the text field at the top of the screen and type a website address, such as <code>aljazeera.com</code>. A tab bar appears at the bottom of the screen and displays the share icon, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.16</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.16 – The share icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.16_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.16 – The share icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap the share icon at the bottom of the screen. A sheet appears from the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Scroll down this sheet until you see a list of options, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.17</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.17 – The Add Bookmark command&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.17_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.17 – The Add Bookmark command</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Add Bookmark</strong>. (If you tap <strong class="bold">Add to Favorites</strong>, you can add a bookmark to the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> folder. If you tap <strong class="bold">Add to Home Screen</strong>, you can add a bookmark that will appear <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>on the Home Screen.) An <strong class="bold">Add Bookmark</strong> screen<a id="_idIndexMarker585"/> appears, which lets you edit a descriptive name of the bookmark, the website address, and a location to save the bookmark, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.18</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.18 – The Add Bookmark screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.18_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.18 – The Add Bookmark screen</p></li>
				<li>(Optional) Edit the name<a id="_idIndexMarker586"/> of the bookmark (tap the <strong class="bold">X</strong> icon on the far right of the bookmark <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>name text field to clear all text).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> under the <strong class="bold">LOCATION</strong> category. The <strong class="bold">LOCATION</strong> category displays a <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> folder, a <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> folder, and a <strong class="bold">New Folder</strong> option, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.19</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.19 – Defining a location to store a bookmark&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.19_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.19 – Defining a location to store a bookmark</p></li>
				<li>Tap a location to store your<a id="_idIndexMarker588"/> bookmark, such as <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> or <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong>. If you tap <strong class="bold">New Folder</strong>, a <strong class="bold">New Folder</strong> screen appears, letting you type a descriptive folder <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>name, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.20</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.20 – The New Folder screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.20_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.20 – The New Folder screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Save</strong>.</li>

			<p>Once you bookmark one or more websites, you can open those websites quickly without typing in a website address.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor404"/>Using a bookmark </h2>
			<p>Bookmarks let you jump to a<a id="_idIndexMarker590"/> favorite website with one tap. To visit a bookmarked website, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears and displays the bookmarks icon at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.21</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.21 – The bookmarks icon&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.21_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.21 – The bookmarks icon</p></li>

The <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> screen appears, listing all previously saved bookmarked <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>websites, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.22</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.22 – The Bookmarks screen&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.22_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.22 – The Bookmarks screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap a bookmark to load that website.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Bookmarks can be handy for<a id="_idIndexMarker592"/> loading your favorite websites quickly. However, the longer your list of bookmarks is, the harder it can be to find a particular website. That's why you need to know how to delete bookmarks as well.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor405"/>Deleting and moving a bookmark </h2>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>Safari adds<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> a bookmark, the list of bookmarks<a id="_idIndexMarker595"/> may not be in the <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>order you like. Fortunately, you can rearrang<a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>e or even delete bookmarks to make your bookmark list more manageable. </p>
			<p>To rearrange<a id="_idIndexMarker598"/> bookmarks, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears and displays the bookmarks icon at the <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>bottom of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.21</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the bookmarks icon. The <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> screen appears, listing all previously saved bookmarked websites (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.22</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Delete icons appear to the left of each bookmark and move icons appear to the right, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.23</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.23 – Editing a bookmark list&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.23_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.23 – Editing a bookmark list</p></li>
				<li>Place your fingertip over the move icon of the bookmark you want to move and slide your finger<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> up or down. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Rearranging the order<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> of bookmarks can help you organize your bookmarks, but <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>sometimes you may want to delete a bookmark altogether. To delete a bookmark, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>Screen. The Safari screen appears and displays the bookmarks icon at the bottom of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.21</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the bookmarks icon. The <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> screen appears, listing all previously saved bookmarked websites (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.22</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Delete icons appear to the left of each bookmark and move icons appear to the right (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.23</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the delete icon to the left of the bookmark you want to remove. A red <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button appears to the right of the bookmark, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.24</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.24 – Deleting a bookmark&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.24_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.24 – Deleting a bookmark</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Bookmarks are<a id="_idIndexMarker604"/> handy for saving your favorite websites, but<a id="_idIndexMarker605"/> bookmarks are only useful if you remember to bookmark a specific website. For another way to visit a previously visited website, consider using your browsing history instead.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor406"/>Viewing browsing history</h1>
			<p>As you visit various <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>websites, Safari keeps track of all the website addresses (unless you use <strong class="bold">Private Browsing Mode</strong>). By reviewing your browsing history, you can return to any previously viewed website.</p>
			<p>To reopen a website that you visited previously, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears and displays the bookmarks icon at the bottom of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.21</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the bookmarks icon. The <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> screen appears, listing all previously saved bookmarked websites (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.22</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the history icon. A list of previously viewed website addresses appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.25</em>:<p class="figure-caption"><img alt="Figure 9.25 – Previously viewed website list &#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.25_B14100.png"/></p><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.25 – Previously viewed website list </p></li>
				<li>Tap on a<a id="_idIndexMarker607"/> previously viewed website to see it again. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Keeping track of your browsing history can be handy if you remember visiting a website but can't remember its address. However, you may eventually want to clear your browsing history to protect your privacy. </p>
			<p>To clear your <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>browsing history, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears and displays the bookmarks icon at the bottom of the screen (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.21</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the bookmarks icon. The <strong class="bold">Bookmarks</strong> screen appears, listing all previously saved bookmarked websites (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.22</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap the history icon. A list of previously viewed website addresses appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.25</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Clear</strong> in the bottom-right corner of the screen. A list of options appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.26</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.26 – Choosing how to clear the browsing history&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.26_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.26 – Choosing how to clear the browsing history</p></li>
				<li>Tap an option, such as <strong class="bold">Today</strong> or <strong class="bold">All time</strong>. Safari deletes your browsing history based on the time span you choose.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Using bookmarks or browsing through your history can be handy to view a previously opened website, but what happens if you're in an area where you lack internet or cellular phone network access, such as in an airplane? Then, you can rely on something called a reading list.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor407"/>Using reading lists</h1>
			<p>Normally, if you lack access to the<a id="_idIndexMarker609"/> internet or a cellular phone network, you cannot read web pages. However, if you download and save web pages in a reading list, you can later read saved web pages anywhere you go, even if you lack access to the internet or cellular phone network. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor408"/>Storing web pages in a reading list</h2>
			<p>Before you can read anything, you <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>need to store items in a reading list. To store a web page<a id="_idIndexMarker611"/> in a reading list, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the text field at the top of the screen and type a website address, and then navigate to a web page that you want to save.</li>
				<li>Tap the share icon. A sheet of icons appears at the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Slide down the sheet of icons until you see a list of commands, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.27</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.27 – The Add to Reading List command &#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.27_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.27 – The Add to Reading List command </p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Add to Reading List</strong>. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you save one or <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>more web pages to your reading list, you will be<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> able to read them any time in the future.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor409"/>Viewing web pages in a reading list</h2>
			<p>A reading list<a id="_idIndexMarker614"/> lets you keep a list of web pages to read. Just remember that if the <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>contents of that web page changes in the future, you can only read the content you saved at the time you added it to the reading list.</p>
			<p>To read a web page saved in a reading list, follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the bookmarks icon at the bottom of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the reading list icon. A list of saved web pages appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.28</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.28 – The reading list&#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.28_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.28 – The reading list</p></li>
				<li>Tap on a web page to read. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>When you <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>choose a saved<a id="_idIndexMarker617"/> web page to read, Safari automatically removes that web page from the reading list. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor410"/>Deleting web pages in a reading list</h2>
			<p>Sometimes, you may save a<a id="_idIndexMarker618"/> web page in your reading list but later decide you want to<a id="_idIndexMarker619"/> remove it without reading it. To delete a web page from the reading list, follow these steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap the bookmarks icon at the bottom of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the reading list icon. A list of saved web pages appears (see <em class="italic">Figure 9.28</em>).</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Empty circles appear to the left of each saved web page.</li>
				<li>Tap in the circle to the left of one or more web pages you want to delete, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.29</em>:<p class="figure-caption"><img alt="Figure 9.29 – Selecting web pages to delete in a reading list &#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.29_B14100.png"/></p><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.29 – Selecting web pages to delete in a reading list </p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> in the bottom-left corner of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong> in the upper-right corner of the screen. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Saving web pages in a<a id="_idIndexMarker620"/> reading list can give you something to read<a id="_idIndexMarker621"/> in the future, but if you want to share interesting web pages with others, you need to know how to share websites easily.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor411"/>Sharing websites</h1>
			<p>Chances are<a id="_idIndexMarker622"/> good that you'll run across a web page with interesting, funny, or useful information that you may want to share with friends, relatives, or co-workers. Three common ways to share websites are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Through email</li>
				<li>Through text message</li>
				<li>Through AirDrop</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To share a website, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears.</li>
				<li>Visit a web page that you want to share with others.</li>
				<li>Tap the share icon at the bottom of the screen. A sheet appears at the bottom of the screen, showing icons that represent people you recently contacted, along with the <strong class="bold">AirDrop</strong>, <strong class="bold">Messages</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> icons, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.30</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.30 – Sharing web pages &#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.30_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.30 – Sharing web pages </p></li>
				<li>Tap on an icon that represents a recent contact, or tap the <strong class="bold">AirDrop</strong>, <strong class="bold">Messages</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Mail</strong> icon. Then, specify the person you want to send your chosen website to. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>By sharing websites <a id="_idIndexMarker623"/>with others, you can pass along information that others might never find on their own. When people receive your website link, they can just tap or click on it to visit that website without typing any long website address. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor412"/>Searching with Safari</h1>
			<p>When you know a <a id="_idIndexMarker624"/>specific website you want to visit, you can type in that website address. However, many times, you may know what information you want to find but you don't know a specific website to visit. </p>
			<p>That's when you need to search for the information you want. To search in Safari, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> app on the Home Screen. The Safari screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap in the text field at the top of the screen and type a word or phrase that defines what you want to find, such as <code>cat breeds</code> or <code>fish recipes</code>.</li>
				<li>Tap the blue <strong class="bold">go</strong> button in the bottom-right corner of the virtual keyboard. Safari displays a list of websites that match your search criteria.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When Safari searches the internet, it relies on a search engine such as Google. If you aren't happy with the results you get when searching for information, try changing the search engine Safari uses.</p>
			<p>To define the search engine for Safari, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> app on the Home Screen. The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Safari</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Safari</strong> settings screen appears.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Search Engine</strong>. A list of search engines appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.31</em>:<div><img alt="Figure 9.31 – Choosing a search engine for Safari &#13;&#10;" src="img/Figure_9.31_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.31 – Choosing a search engine for Safari </p></li>
				<li>Tap on a search engine to use, such as <strong class="bold">Yahoo</strong> or <strong class="bold">Baidu</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Search engines all <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>have their strengths and weaknesses, so experiment with different search engines until you find the one that consistently gives you the <a id="_idTextAnchor413"/>best results every time you search with Safari.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor414"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Part of the iPhone's usefulness isn't just in making and sending phone calls or text messages, but also in putting a computer in your pocket so that you can access the internet. Through Safari, you can browse any websites on the internet.  </p>
			<p>Almost everyone needs to search the internet at one time or another, so make sure you know how to search and switch search engines if necessary. If you find a particularly useful or interesting website, share it with your friends or bookmark it so that you can find it later.</p>
			<p>You can also share websites by email, so read the next chapter, which focuses on all the different ways to read, write, and sort through email messages.  </p>
