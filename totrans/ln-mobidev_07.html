                    <h1 class="header-title">Minimal Viable Product Case Studies</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this final chapter, we explore different strategies for the construction of a <strong>Minimal Viable Product</strong> (<strong>MVP</strong>).</p>
<p>These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concierge</li>
<li>Landing page</li>
<li>Fake-O-Backend</li>
<li>Competitor apps</li>
<li>Analog</li>
<li>Dry-wallet</li>
<li>Letter of intent</li>
</ul>
<p>The preceding strategies provide a framework for running quick experiments at varying levels of fidelity, and leveraging the learnings to answer high-risk assumptions about your app's business model canvas.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll dive into an MVP case study to learn more about how they are applied across a series of experiment loops.</p>
<p>We'll discuss Fun with Charades, an app that my team and I built to help people around the world play charades through an online video chat room. We'll discuss the original vision, key high-risk assumptions we faced, how we developed a hypothesis-led approach to testing them, how we iterated based on learnings, and our final conclusions.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Fun with Charades - Initial vision</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Here's the initial vision, target audience, and problem statement that we started with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vision</strong>: To create a fun place where people make new friends online</li>
<li><strong>Target</strong>: Teens, college kids, yuppies, casual gamers</li>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: To connect people online through dumb charades</li>
</ul>
<p>As we thought about this, there were a number of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do people care at all about charades? <em>Ellen's</em> charades game was wildly popular, and there was a lot of buzz around Heads Up Charades!, but that was not indicative of whether people would want to play online.</li>
<li>Would charades be engaging enough that people would want to play regularly?</li>
<li>If we set up a real-time game to mimic the mechanics of the game we are used to, that would require friends being present at the same time, which may be hard to schedule.</li>
<li>If scheduling was hard, would people be comfortable playing with strangers in game rooms, like online poker?</li>
<li>Wouldn't people freak out just a bit about using video online? Are there communities that are more open to using video online?</li>
<li>If we built an async game with mobile apps so that people could play when they had time, that might work. But would it be practical for people to respond to a challenge by acting while simultaneously holding their smartphones in front of them?</li>
<li>And then, there was the question of whether we had an interest and competencies in gaming.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The big ifs</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We set out to break these down and tackle what we felt were the biggest doubts on our list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are people interested in playing charades online?</li>
<li>Are they comfortable using video online?</li>
<li>Do they like the concept enough to invite friends or join a public game room?</li>
<li>Do they enjoy the playing experience with others in the room?</li>
<li>Do they enjoy this enough to keep coming back?</li>
<li>Will they invite other people?</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we attempted to structure experiments around the major leap-of-faith assumptions being made, in order to seek validation.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Hypothesis 1</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Of a sampling set of people searching for charades online, at least 25% will sign up to check out the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audience</strong>: Targets the people looking to play charades online.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong>: Uses Google Ads.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: This includes the percentage of sign-ups.</li>
<li><strong>Execution</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Build the signup page in a day.</li>
<li>Identify keywords and run ads for a week.</li>
<li>Track signups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Result</strong>: We ran ads targeting users who searched for "charades online", "charades games", and "charades words", and over 25% of the users signed up.</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong>: There's an interest in playing charades online among those who search for it on Google:</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Hypothesis 2</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Of the users in the target demographic who are shown mockup flows of the game concept, at least 70% of them would be very interested in the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audience</strong>: Targets the young adults in India.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong>: Uses your friends network for recruitment.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: This includes the % of people who are very interested in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Execution</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Build rough mock-ups using MockFlow in a day.</li>
<li>Walk people through the mock-ups.</li>
<li>Collect feedback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Result</strong>: Overall, there was unanimous interest in the game concept, but a few mentioned that they may be uncomfortable being on video online.</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong>: In general, charades is popular in India, and people are interested in trying out an online game:</li>
</ul>
<div><img class=" image-border" src="img/88af0b49-52e2-4426-8ae4-878e0478ab2a.png"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Hypothesis 3</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Of the signed-up charades users invited to a game room, at least 25% will be willing to join a public room and use video online:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audience</strong>: This includes the signed-up users.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong>: N/A.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: Includes the % of users who used online video in a public room.</li>
<li><strong>Execution</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Invite users to the public room.</li>
<li>Provide an explanation on what the game is about.</li>
<li>Enable the user to turn the video on and start the game.</li>
<li>Track analytics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Result</strong>: 80% of the users visited the page, but &lt; 5% turned the video on.</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong>: This experiment invalidated our false hope that people in this era of FaceTime and Hangouts wouldn't hesitate to use video online. Therefore, we need to dig deeper, and talk to users to understand how they felt:</li>
</ul>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="377" src="img/00444a7a-c132-41a4-8156-d066d4c0789c.png" width="639"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Hypothesis 4</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Users are more likely to be comfortable using video online if they are playing with their friends, and 80% or more will then use video online:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audience</strong>: Targets friends of friends who are acquainted with each other, but don't know each other well.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong>: Uses your friends network for recruitment.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: This includes the % of users who use video online. % of users who like the game idea enough that they would be disappointed to not play.</li>
<li><strong>Execution</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Invite users to the public room.</li>
<li>Provide an explanation as to what the game is about.</li>
<li>Enable the user to turn the video on and start the game</li>
<li>Track analytics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Result</strong>: 100% of users turned the video on and were excited and ready to engage in the game, and they felt they would be very disappointed if they were unable to play.</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong>: When asked if they would play with people they didn't know online, women said they would hesitate, while men in the group unanimously said they would be willing to try:</li>
</ul>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="193" src="img/9246a28c-c714-4816-842d-86d609b92796.png" width="558"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Hypothesis 5</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Users from online communities who use video online with strangers are a lot more likley to be comfortable playing with each other, and at least 25% will use video online:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audience</strong>: Targets Chatroulette and Chatrandom communities.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong>: Uses Google Ads.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: This includes the % of users who turn the video on.</li>
<li><strong>Execution</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Run Google Ads for Chatroulette and Chatrandom, offering video-based charades online, and an opportunity to meet new people.</li>
<li>Invite users to the public room.</li>
<li>Provide an explanation on what the game is about.</li>
<li>Enable the user to turn the video on and start the game.</li>
<li>Track analytics.</li>
<li>Add a Qualroo-style prompt to find out why they don't turn the video on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Result</strong>: 50% of the users visited the page, but &lt; 10% turned the video on. 5% answered the prompt indicating they didn't want to turn the video on, would try later, or weren't sure how to turn it on.</li>
<li><strong>Learning</strong>: Given the anonymity of these communities, it was hard to reach out directly and get feedback, and the sampling size of the responders to the prompt was too small to infer enough.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The conundrum</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We spoke to a group of users and collated feedback. So, at this point, we were faced with this conundrum from our learnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a certain level of interest in charades, but it's mostly seen as a family and friends game.</li>
<li>For those who see their friends and family often enough, playing charades online wasn't appealing. (Playing live with them during Thanksgiving or Christmas was still appealing.)</li>
<li>The average user isn't comfortable playing with random strangers online.</li>
<li>Even communities that are comfortable dealing with nudity online, and have no reservations, didn't find the idea appealing</li>
<li>Improvements in the visual design and explanatory information offered did not increase conversions.</li>
<li>A game like this requires a fairly engaged community, and it didn't appear that charades would sustain that level of engagement.</li>
<li>There's a community of people in the subcontinent that loves dumb charades, but the version that's played is fairly technical and geeky, and would not scale out.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What we did well</h1>
                
            
            
                
<ul>
<li>Captured our thought process and assumptions, laying out the facts for us to succeed</li>
<li>Identified small batches that could be proven (or disproven) with minimum cost, rapidly built, and iterated through the batches</li>
<li>Stayed honest and objective, tracked metrics and cohorts well</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What we could have done better</h1>
                
            
            
                
<ul>
<li>Most early feedback was from subcontinent users, since reaching out to an international audience was not easy. Consequently feedback was not fully representative of the target audience.</li>
<li>We built more than we should have before we understood the gaps in our understanding of the customer and their behavior.</li>
<li>We included more online surveys early on enough to have better insights.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We still believed in the original vision, and it's possible that persevering and keeping this going out there in the wild may have yielded something. However, we were invalidated conclusively and decided to pivot away and explore other ideas. In hindsight, it was a good decision and likely saved us from the clutches of the sunken cost fallacy.</p>
<p>Many people have strong misgivings about wasting resources (loss aversion). The example we saw in this chapter involved a non-refundable sporting event ticket. Many people would feel obliged to go to the event despite not really wanting to, because doing otherwise would be wasting the ticket price; they feel they've passed the point of no return.</p>
<p>This is sometimes referred to as the sunk cost fallacy. Economists would label this behavior irrational: it is inefficient because it misallocates resources by depending on information that is irrelevant to the decision being made. (via Wikipedia).</p>
<p>The important takeaways from this case study are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rigor and discipline needed to run experiments</li>
<li>The willingness to adapt based on new learnings and surprises</li>
<li>The need to focus on the vision (although, in this case, our team did not stay committed to it long term)</li>
<li>The leverage of proxy users and trade-offs involved</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next chapter, you will learn more about using <strong>Software as a Service</strong> (<strong>SaaS</strong>) cloud-based services to enable you to rapidly run experiment loops.</p>
