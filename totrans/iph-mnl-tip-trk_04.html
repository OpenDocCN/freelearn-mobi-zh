			<p>The iPhone is a combination of a music player, pocket computer, and mobile phone, but is sold as a phone, and so has the essential purpose of letting you make phone calls. While making and receiving calls sounds simple, there can be all kinds of variations involved in making and receiving calls.</p>
			<p>For example, you might want to hold a conference call so you can chat with multiple people at the same time. Or, while on a call, you may get another call so you need to put one person on hold so you can answer the second call. You might also get calls from people you no longer want to hear from, so you block certain calls. Additionally, while on hold, you may be instructed to press a number to choose an option.</p>
			<p>As you can see, just something as seemingly straightforward as making and receiving calls can range from simple to complicated, depending on what you want to do. In this chapter, you'll learn all the basics involved in making and receiving phone calls, along with additional features you may find useful as you talk on your iPhone.</p>
			<p>The topics we will cover in the chapter are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Making a call</li>
				<li>Receiving a call</li>
				<li>Taking multiple calls</li>
				<li>Blocking callers</li>
				<li>Blocking disturbances </li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Making a call</h1>
			<p>The most <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>straightforward way of making a phone call is to <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>dial a complete number. For example, many businesses advertise their phone number in public so people can call to get information or purchase a product or service. </p>
			<p>Yet in most cases, few people memorize and type in anyone's complete phone number. Instead, it's far more common to store someone's phone number once and then simply tap that person's name to dial their phone number to reach them. </p>
			<p>Another way to make a phone call is to view a phone number on a web page or in a text message. Then you can simply tap that phone number to call it without having to type in the number <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>yourself. With so many different ways to make <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>a phone call, you have lots of choice in how you make a phone call with your iPho<a id="_idTextAnchor195"/><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>ne.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Typing a complete phone number</h2>
			<p>Oftentimes <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>you'll need to call someone for the first time, but you don't need to store the phone number to call it again in the future. In this case, it's easier to type in that person's phone number once to make your call without storing that phone number for future use. To make a call by typing a complete phone number, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tap the Phone icon on the Home screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.1</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer086"><img alt="Figure 4.1 – The Phone icon on the Home screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.01_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – The Phone icon on the Home screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Keypad</strong> button at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.2</em>. The keypad <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>screen appears displaying a phone keypad<a id="_idTextAnchor198"/><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer087"><img alt="Figure 4.2 – The Keypad button&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.02_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 – The Keypad button</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>numbers of the telephone number you want to call (such as <strong class="source-inline">1-800-555-1234</strong>) and tap the green <strong class="bold">Call icon </strong>indicated in the preceding figure. After you press the green call icon, it will turn into a red hang-up icon that you can tap to end the call, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.3<a id="_idTextAnchor200"/><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/></em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer088">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 – The hang-up icon</p>
			<p>The second way to end a phone call is to press the Sleep/Wake button on <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>the side of the iPhone, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.4</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer089">

			<p>For phone numbers you may only need to call infrequently, typing in the entire phone number <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>may be fine since you won't have to do it often. However, if that phone number already appears on the screen, there's no reason to type it in again. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/>Calling a phone number from the screen</h2>
			<p>Typing <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>in a complete phone number can be tedious and error-prone because if you type the wrong number, you won't reach the person you expected. That's why it's more accurate to simply tap a phone number to let your iPhone dial that number for you automatically.  </p>
			<p>Some common places to find telephone numbers to tap and call are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Websites</li>
				<li>Email messages</li>
				<li>Text messages</li>
				<li>Notes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To call a phone number displayed on the screen on a web page, message, note, or any other app, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the number on the screen that you want to call. A menu of different options appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.5</em>. The exact appearance will vary depending on whether you're tapping a phone number on a website or a phone number in a text message or note:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer090"><img alt="Figure 4.5 – The Call button appears after tapping a phone number displayed on the screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.05_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5 – The Call button appears after tapping a phone number displayed on the screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Call</strong> button. If you tap the <strong class="bold">Call</strong> button, your iPhone dials the number for you. If you don't want to call, tap anywhere on the screen away from the menu to make it go away, or tap the <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong> button if one appea<a id="_idTextAnchor205"/><a id="_idTextAnchor206"/>rs. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Calling <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>numbers that appear on the screen can be convenient, but not every number you want to call will appear on the screen. To avoid memorizing and typing in multiple phone numbers, it's much easier to use the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app to store phone numbers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/>Storing and calling a number from the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app</h2>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>you just need to call a number once, it's easier to type that number in. However, if you know <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>you'll want to call someone again in the future, it's easier to store that number in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. That way when you want to call that person again, you can just tap their phone number.</p>
			<p>To store <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>a phone number in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app, follow <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the Phone app on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.6</em>. A list of names currently stored in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app appears:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer091"><img alt="Figure 4.6 – The Contacts icon&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.06_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6 – The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> icon</p></li>
				<li>Tap <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>the <strong class="bold">+</strong> (add) icon <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>in the <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>upper-right corner to display <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>a new contact screen.</li>
				<li>Scroll down and tap the <strong class="bold">+ add phone</strong> button, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.7</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer092"><img alt="Figure 4.7 – The add phone button on the New Contact screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.07_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7 – The add phone button on the New Contact screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap in <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>that person's phone number and tap <strong class="bold">Done</strong> when you're finished adding <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>in any other contact information, such as the person's name.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After you've <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>stored a person's name <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>and phone number in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app, you can call that person by simply tapping on that person's phone number. To call a number stored in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>the name of the person <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>you want to call.</li>
				<li>Tap the phone number you want to call, as shown <a id="_idTextAnchor208"/><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>in <em class="italic">Figure 4.8</em>:</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.8 – Tap on a phone number to call</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>can be a handy way to store the phone numbers of friends, business associates, relatives, and anyone else important in your life. However, you'll likely store a large <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>number of phone numbers in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app, but only call a handful of those numbers regularly. To make it faster to reach someone you call often, you can designate that person as a favorite person.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>Calling a favorite person</h2>
			<p>Everyone <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>has a small list of people they call most often, perhaps including a spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend, family members, and business associates. While you could constantly hunt for that person's phone number in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app, it's much faster to designate certain people as favorites.</p>
			<p>Think of the favorites list as a subset of the names and phone numbers stored in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. By creating a favorites list, you can quickly find the names and phone numbers of the people you care about the most. Even better, if someone has multiple phone numbers, your favorites list can store just the phone number that's most likely to reach that other person.</p>
			<p>To create a favorites list, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the Phone app on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon in the upper-left corner of the screen. The <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app will list all names stored.</li>
				<li>Tap a <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>name that you want to identify as a favorite person. A dialog appears, listing <strong class="bold">Message</strong>, <strong class="bold">Call</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Mail</strong>, which lets you choose that person's contact information for text messaging, phone calls, or email, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.9</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer094"><img alt="Figure 4.9 – Choosing which contact information to store in the favorites list&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.09_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9 – Choosing which contact information to store in the favorites list</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Call</strong>. If the person you chose has multiple phone numbers, you'll be able to choose <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>which number you want to store in your favorites list.</li>
				<li>Tap a phone number. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've stored one or more names and phone numbers in the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> list, you can make a call any time by viewing your <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> list. </p>
			<p>To make a call from the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> list, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the Phone app on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Favorites</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. A list of previously stored favorite names appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on a name to call that person. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Adding <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>names and phone numbers to your favorites list can help you find and call the people you talk to most often. However, sometimes you may not have stored someone's name and phone number in your favorites list. Fortunately, you can always call anyone back by simply looking up the list of recent callers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Calling recent callers</h2>
			<p>Each time <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>you call or receive a call from someone, your iPhone keeps track of that person's name (if you previously stored it in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app) or phone number. The idea is that if you spoke to someone recently, you'll likely want to talk to that person again.</p>
			<p>The Phone app gives you a choice between viewing <strong class="bold">All</strong> or <strong class="bold">Missed</strong> calls. The <strong class="bold">Missed</strong> list only displays people who tried calling you, but that you failed to answer. The <strong class="bold">All</strong> list displays both people you called (in black) and people who tried calling you (in red), as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.10</em>: </p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer095">
					<img alt="Figure 4.10 – The All list displays both people you called and those who called you&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.10_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.10 – The All list displays both people you called and those who called you</p>
			<p>This list <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>of recent calls can be particularly handy in case someone called you and you want to call them back but don't have their phone number saved on your iPhone.</p>
			<p>To call a number stored in the <strong class="bold">Recents</strong> list, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the Phone app on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Recents</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">All</strong> or <strong class="bold">Missed</strong> tab at the top of the screen. </li>
				<li>Tap a name or phone number to call. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>While you may call other people, others may call you. When someone calls, you'll have the option <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>of answering that call or declining, so you need to understand your options for receiving a<a id="_idTextAnchor212"/><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/> call.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>Receiving a call</h1>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>you receive a phone call, your iPhone can play a sound (called a ringtone) and/or vibrate to provide you with additional haptic feedback in case you <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>don't hear the ringtone. When you receive a call, your iPhone will display the calling phone number (or the name of the caller, if you previously stored that person's name and phone number in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app).</p>
			<p>If your iPhone is currently locked, you'll see a screen asking you to swipe to answer the call, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.11</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer096">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.11 – Receiving a phone call on a locked iPhone</p>
			<p>If your iPhone is unlocked and you receive a call, you'll see a slightly different screen that gives <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>you the option of accepting or declining the call, as<a id="_idTextAnchor215"/><a id="_idTextAnchor216"/> shown <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>in <em class="italic">Figure 4.12</em>:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.12 – Receiving a phone call on an unlocked iPhone</p>
			<p>If you tap <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>the banner shown in the preceding figure anywhere <a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>except either the red or green button, the banner expands to fill the entire screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.13</em>:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption"> Figure 4.13 – The expanded incoming call screen</p>
			<p>To define <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>whether an incoming phone call appears as a banner <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>or fullscreen display, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Phone</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Phone</strong> screen appears. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Incoming Calls</strong>. A screen appears, letting you choose between <strong class="bold">Banner</strong> and <strong class="bold">Full Screen</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When you <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>receive a phone call, you have several options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Answer the call (slide to answer or tap the green <strong class="bold">Accept </strong>button).</li>
				<li>Decline the call (tap the red <strong class="bold">Decline </strong>button).</li>
				<li>Set a reminder to call back (tap the <strong class="bold">Remind Me </strong>icon).</li>
				<li>Send a pre-defined message to the caller (tap the <strong class="bold">Message</strong> icon).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Since you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>likely get calls from a variety of people, take <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>some time now to define the ringtone and haptic feedback your iPhone will make<a id="_idTextAnchor217"/><a id="_idTextAnchor218"/> each time you receive a call. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>Defining a ringtone and haptic feedback</h2>
			<p>A ringtone <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>plays a specific sound when you receive a call. Haptic feedback makes your iPhone vibrate to let you know someone's calling. Since you may not always want a ringtone to play when you receive a call (such as when you're in a movie theater), you can turn your iPhone's sound on or off by toggling the Ring/Silent switch that appears on the left side, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.14</em>:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.16 – Choosing a vibration pattern for haptic feedback when receiving a call</p>
			<p>Once <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>you've defined your chosen haptic feedback for when you receive a call, you might want to take time to specify whether you also want your iPhone to play a ringtone or stay silent. In addition, you can also adjust the volume of your ringtone to make it louder or softer.</p>
			<p>To define whether to include haptic feedback with ringtones or when your iPhone is silent, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>the <strong class="bold">Settings </strong>icon on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Sounds &amp; Haptics</strong>.

				<li>Drag the volume slider to adjust the volume of your chosen ringtone.</li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Change with Buttons</strong> switch to allow you to adjust the volume of your ringtone using the volume buttons on the side of the iPhone. If this switch is off, the volume of your ringtone will be defined by the slider position in <em class="italic">step 4</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Defining <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>ringtones, volume, and haptic feedback is fine for notifying you of an incoming call. However, if you get an important call but can't answer it at the time, you have two choices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a reminder to yourself.</li>
				<li>Send a pre-defined message to the caller.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68">Creati<a id="_idTextAnchor228"/><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>ng a reminder for returning a call</h2>
			<p>When someone calls and you aren't able to answer the call right away, but don't want to forget <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>about this call from someone important, set up a reminder. A reminder simply displays a note to yourself to return the call you missed. </p>
			<p>There are two ways you can create a reminder. First, you can create a reminder that will pop up on your iPhone screen as soon as you leave your current location. Second, you can create a reminder that will pop up one hour later. In both cases, the reminders can help you return important calls.</p>

At this point, you can open the <strong class="bold">Reminders</strong> app and tap the green Phone icon to call that person back.</p>
			<p>Reminders can be handy for dealing with calls right away. However, reminders don't let your caller know that you intend to call back. That's why you can prepare pre-defined messages that you can send back to someone right away to let your caller know you'll call back as soon as possible.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Creating messages for returning a call</h2>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>someone calls and you set up a reminder, your caller has no idea when or even if you will call back. To get around this problem, take some time to set up a pre-defined message. Now when someone important calls, you can send them this pre-defined message so they know you got their call but just weren't able to answer it at the moment, and that you'll get back to them.</p>
			<p>The first step to sending a message to a caller is to create the message. Then you can choose which response you want to send. </p>
			<p>To create a message to send to a caller, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Phone</strong>. The <strong class="bold">Phone</strong> screen appears, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.20</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer105"><img alt="Figure 4.20 – The Respond with Text option on the Phone screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.20_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.20 – The Respond with Text option on the Phone screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Respond with Text</strong>. A <strong class="bold">Respond with Text</strong> screen appears, listing several responses you can choose from as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.21</em>. You can either use the default responses or write your own:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer106">
					<img alt="Figure 4.21 – Viewing and editing pre-defined responses&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.21_B14100.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.21 – Viewing and editing pre-defined responses</p>
			<p>Whether <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>you've defined your own messages or just want to use the default messages, you can set them to be sent to a caller to let them know you're not available now but will get back to them as soon as possible. </p>
			<p>To send a message when receiving a call, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Wait until you receive a call (see <em class="italic">Figures 4.11</em> and <em class="italic">4.13</em>). </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Message </strong>icon. A dialog appears, giving you a choice of which message to send, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.22</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer107"><img alt="Figure 4.22 – Choosing the message to send to a caller&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.22_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.22 – Choosing the message to send to a caller</p></li>
				<li>Tap the message you want to send or choos<a id="_idTextAnchor236"/><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>e <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> to type a message to send.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>By using <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>reminders and messages, you can return important phone calls as soon as possible. In some cases, you may be talking to one person when another call comes in that you have to take at that moment. Rather than calling that person back, you might want to take that second call while still holding on to t<a id="_idTextAnchor238"/><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>he first call.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>Taking multiple calls</h1>
			<p>If you're <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>talking to someone important and another crucial call comes in, you may want to keep both calls on the line. To do this, the iPhone gives you two options. First, you can put the first caller on hold temporarily while you talk to the second caller. When you're done with the second call, you can then return to the first caller.</p>
			<p>Second, you can take both calls in a conference call. That way, multiple people can talk to each other at once. </p>
			<p>Putting people on hold can be handy when you want to talk to one person at a time. Conference calls are useful when you want a group of people to talk to each other.</p>
			<p>To create a conference call or put the current caller on hold so you can chat with a second person, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Call or accept a call from another person. When a second person calls while you're already connected to someone else, your iPhone gives you options to hold or end your current call, or switch to the second caller, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.23</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer108"><img alt="Figure 4.23 – Receiving a second call in the middle of another call&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.23_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.23 – Receiving a second call in the middle of another call</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Hold &amp; Accept</strong>. This will let you put your current caller on hold while you speak to the second caller.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">merge calls</strong> to <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>create a conference call (or tap <strong class="bold">swap</strong> to speak to the other person), as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.24</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer109"><img alt="Figure 4.24 – Choosing to merge or swap callers&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.24_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.24 – Choosing to merge or swap callers</p></li>
				<li>Tap the red hang-up button when you want to disconnect from the call.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In most cases, you'll be happy to receive phone calls on your iPhone. Unfortunately, many con artists, telemarketers, and just plain annoying people may try to call you. While you can ignore these calls, they <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>might never stop calling periodically. When this happens, you might want to consider blocking these callers for good. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>Blocking callers</h1>
			<p>Most likely <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>you'll get phone calls from people you don't want to talk to, either because you no longer like them anymore or because they're unsolicited calls from people you don't know.</p>
			<p>When you get a phone call, the caller's name appears on the screen if you've added that phone number and the caller's name in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. If you have not added both the phone number and caller's name in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app, only the caller's phone number appears on the screen.</p>
			<p>Once you receive a call from someone, you can block that phone number. To block a call, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the Phone icon on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Recents</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen. A list of recent calls appears where an <strong class="bold">i</strong> is shown inside a circle icon to the right of each call, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.25</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer110"><img alt="Figure 4.25 – The information icon appears next to each received call&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.25_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.25 – The information icon appears next to each received call</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">i</strong>-inside-a-circle icon that appears to the right of the caller you want to block. A new <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>screen appears listing details about the caller, such as their phone number and the time they called.</li>
				<li>Scroll down this screen until you find the <strong class="bold">Block this Caller</strong> option near the bottom, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.26</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer111"><img alt="Figure 4.26 – The Block this Caller option&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.26_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.26 – The Block this<a id="_idTextAnchor242"/> Caller option</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Block this Caller</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you block a caller, that person can call you all they want and they'll never annoy you with their <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>calls ringing or by appearing on your iPhone again. Feel free to block any callers you like, including people you no longer want to talk to, or complete strangers you never wanted to talk to in the first place.</p>
			<p>Occasionally, you may need to stop blocking a particular phone number, such as one belonging to someone you're now willing to talk to again. To unblock a previously blocked phone number, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Phone</strong> icon and scroll down to the bottom of the screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.27</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer112"><img alt="Figure 4.27 – The Blocked Contacts option on the Phone screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.27_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.27 – The Blocked <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> option on the Phone screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Blocked Contacts</strong>. A list of blocked phone numbers appears.</li>
				<li>Tap on <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>the phone number you want to unblock. A screen appears listing various options, including <strong class="bold">Add to Existing Contact</strong>.</li>
				<li>Tap <strong class="bold">Add to Existing Contact</strong> to add the blocked phone number to your <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>After blocking <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>callers, go through your list of blocked calls periodically to make sure you didn't accidentally block an unknown but valid caller. That way you can ensure that you only receive calls you want from people you already know. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Blocking disturbances </h1>
			<p>Sometimes <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>you may want to set aside time for when you don't want your iPhone ringing or displaying alerts or notifications. When you want a little peace and quiet, you can turn on the <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> feature. To turn this feature on, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Tap the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> icon on the Home screen. </li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> icon. The <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> screen appears as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.28</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer113"><img alt="Figure 4.28 – The Do Not Disturb screen&#13;&#10;" src="image/Figure_4.28_B14100.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.28 – The Do Not Disturb screen</p></li>
				<li>Tap the <strong class="bold">Do Not Disturb</strong> switch to turn it on or off. When Do Not Disturb is on, a crescent moon icon appears in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Another way <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>to toggle Do Not Disturb on or off is to open the Control Center (swipe up from the bottom on iPhones with a Home button, or swipe down from the upper right corner on iPhones without a Home button). Then tap the Do Not Disturb icon shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.29</em>:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer114">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.29 – The Do Not Disturb icon on the Control Center screen</p>
			<p>Finally, if someone <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>calls and you want to silence the ringing, press the Lock button. Remember, you can control when you accept and reject phone calls and notifications.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>The main purpose of the iPhone is to make and receive phone calls. Making and receiving a phone call is fairly straightforward, but there are additional options you might want to use, such as creating a conference call, putting someone on hold, or using a keypad to choose different options while calling an automated service. </p>
			<p>To help identify callers, it's best to store their names and phone numbers in the <strong class="bold">Contacts</strong> app. That way, the person's name will appear on the iPhone screen when they call, so you never have to guess.</p>
			<p>Since you'll likely get unwanted calls, make sure you know how to block and unblock callers. You'll never be able to stop all unwanted calls, but by blocking certain phone numbers, you can make sure unwanted callers can't pester you anymore.</p>
			<p>Making and receiving phone calls is a major use for your iPhone. However, there are other ways to communicate as well, such as text messaging, which many people use just as often as talking, so we will be covering this in the next chapter. </p>
