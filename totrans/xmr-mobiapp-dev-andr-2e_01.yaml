    Android 4.4 (KitKat) as a new experimental runtime environment and is implemented
    fully in Android 5.0 (Lollipop). This is primarily designed for performance and
    an improved app start up time. The primary difference between ART and Dalvik is
    the compilation approach. While Dalvik uses JIT, ART employs a new concept called
    **Ahead-of-Time** (**AOT**). What this means is that new apps are getting compiled
    during installation, before they are even launched. To learn more about ART, you

    An activity represents a single screen with a user interface through which a user
    can interact with the application. A single application is composed of many activities.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A fragment is a reusable user interface component, introduced since Android
    3.0 (API level 11), and is primarily intended to build dynamic and modular user
    interfaces for different screen sizes. A fragment is always embedded in an activity,
    and like any other view, it lives in a `ViewGroup` (**ViewGroups** are explained
    in more detail later in this chapter) inside the view hierarchy. Like an activity,
    a fragment defines its own layout and has its own life cycle callbacks. When designing
    your application to support multiple form factors, fragments can be reused to
    optimize the user experience based on the available screen space.

    a bit tricky. In the following section, we will dig more into the fragment behavior
    and its life cycle methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Android fragment has its own life cycle method, which is very similar to
    an activity. It contains all of the activity life cycle methods and is supplied
    with some additional callback methods. Fragments are always embedded in an activity,
    so its callbacks are directly affected due to the host activities' life cycle.
    For example, if the host activity receives `onStop()`, all the attached fragments
    also receive the `onStop()` callback.

    an activity layout using the `fragment` tag, and while the content view of the
    activity is being inflated (typically, when `setContentView()` is called on an
    activity). This method passes `AttributeSet` that holds all the fragment attributes
    passed from the `fragment` tag. These attributes can be stored for later use.
    At this stage, the fragment is not even associated with an activity, and hence,
    we cannot perform any user interface-related tasks.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and loads the view object hierarchy it contains. This method passes three arguments:
    `LayoutInflater`, `ViewGroup`, and `bundle`. The `LayoutInflater` argument can
    be used to inflate any layout for a fragment. A `bundle` specifies whether the
    fragment is created freshly or recreated. If it is recreated from the previous
    saved state, then the bundle will be non-null.'
