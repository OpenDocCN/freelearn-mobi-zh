- en: With Xcode 6, Apple has made game development more accessible to anyone wanting
    to learn it. No additional installations are required. All the features needed
    for making a game are right at your fingertips. You can create a simple game for
    iOS devices with just a single touch control, or you can create a full-fledged
    big-budget game for OS X. Your imagination is the limit.

- en: Apple's new programming language Swift is at the heart of all this magic. Programming
    doesn't get easier than this. You don't have struggle between creating an interface
    and implementation for each class. Say goodbye to square brackets. And yet, it
    looks and feels like any other programming language so that you can hit the ground
    running. If you are coming from a JavaScript or ActionScript background, you will
    feel right at home. Even if you are proficient only in Objective-C, there is no
    need to worry as all the game development technologies work with both Objective-C
    and Swift.

- en: With improved lighting and physics in SpriteKit, you don't have to write extra
    code to make your games come to life. Scenes in games will have proper lighting;
    all you have to do is provide the location of the light source. You can provide
    a normal map, which will caste shadows depending on the direction of the light
    source. With tools such as Glyph Designer, Texture Packer, and Spine, you can
    really make your game shine and stand out, technically and visually.

- en: SceneKit is finally here on iOS devices. So now you can create 3D games with
    ease. You can also create texture geometries, camera, and lighting right in code.
    You can even import COLLADA files of scenes made in your favorite 3D package into
    SceneKit and see them running without adding any extra code. With SceneKit's inbuilt
    physics and collision system, you can make your game dynamic. The coolest thing
    is that you can also add a SpriteKit layer for the 2D GUI and the button interface.

- en: If all that wasn't enough, Apple has also introduced Metal, a new graphics library
    developed only for Apple devices. Developed from the ground up, it greatly reduces
    the size of the overhead and brings the code much closer to the GPU so that you
    can add more stuff onto the screen and still maintain a smooth 60 Hz frame rate.
    At the same time, Apple gives you the freedom to develop games using OpenGLES
    as well.

    the creation of a basic game in SpriteKit, while you understand the basic elements
    of SpriteKit, such as sprites, scenes, and labels. We also create a basic physics
    engine and add collision detection and scoring.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. SceneKit"), *SceneKit*, shows the creation
    of a basic 3D game in SceneKit. This chapter teaches you how to add objects such
    as geometries, lighting, and cameras to the game scene. You also get to import
    COLLADA files into the scene and integrate the SpriteKit interface to add the
    GUI and the button interface.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need the latest version of Xcode 6 and A Mac running OS X Yosemite,
    or at least Maverick version 10.9.4\. Although a simulator is included with Xcode,
    it is better to get an iOS device running iOS 8\. For running Metal, a device
    with the A7 chip or higher is mandatory, as it won't run on a simulator.
