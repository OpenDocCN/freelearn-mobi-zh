- en: This book will take our readers to a fun-filled ride where they will not just
    learn about the latest Android N SDK, but also about the other APIs and how they can
    create highly interactive and interesting games with them. The book will show
    readers how to create a complete game from scratch, designed for the Android platform.
    It will start by setting up the Android N SDK and other repositories, and then
    it will show readers how to customize the development environment. After this, it
    will show readers how to create game elements, objects, game layouts, game architecture,
    and game loops. It will create reusable Java code scripts, which will help you
    in your other game projects. An integral part of game development is to integrate
    images and graphics seamlessly. As we move ahead, we will show how to efficiently
    work with moving images, creating sprite animations, particle explosions, in-game
    entities, Bitmap fonts, and so on. Prototyping can decrease development time significantly;
    readers will implement prototyping techniques using the libgdx library. Toward
    the end of the book, readers will get a clear idea of improving game physics and
    the collision system, to give their game that real-life look.
