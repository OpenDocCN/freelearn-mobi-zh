- en: With Google's announcement at the I/O Conference in 2017 to make Kotlin an official
    language for Android, Kotlin has been gaining popularity among developers around
    the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, Kotlin's use and popularity aren't limited to the Android community.
    Many other communities, such as the desktop, web, and backend community are embracing
    Kotlin too. Many new libraries and frameworks are being created and existing ones
    are providing support for Kotlin.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With more developers coming to the Kotlin community and with its natural flexibility,
    more programming styles are being tried. The purpose of this book is to introduce
    the functional programming style to the wide Kotlin community, leading and guiding
    on the first steps, and giving the basic tools to progress further to more advanced
    concepts.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for Kotlin users (programmers, engineers, library authors, and
    architects) who have a basic understanding of Kotlin  and want to understand the
    basics ideas behind functional programming and how to use it in a practical way (if
    you're entirely new to Kotlin, our Appendix, *Kotlin's Quick Start* will give
    you a quick start with the language).

- en: '[Chapter 1](6fd42581-3c3e-4471-b103-22a571a138a4.xhtml), *Kotlin - Data Types,
    Objects, and Classes*, introduces you to object-oriented programming in Kotlin.
    Kotlin is primary object-oriented programming, and we''ll use these features to
    introduce a functional programming style.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](cd9fb97b-d5f0-41d6-b9fb-87259d07a390.xhtml), *Getting Started with
    Functional Programming*, covers the basic principles of functional programming
    using Kotlin''s object-oriented programming features.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](3d8794f8-c237-4d9e-992e-c54a1392a89c.xhtml), *Immutability - It''s
    Important*, emphasizes on immutability as one of the most important concepts in
    functional programming. This chapter will give you an in-depth understanding of
    immutability.'

    a object-oriented programming concept, they can be helpful in making your code
    more modular.'

    other programming paradigms to get the best out of them. This chapter discusses
    how you can combine functional programming with object-oriented programming and
    reactive programming.'
